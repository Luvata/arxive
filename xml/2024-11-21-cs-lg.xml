      <title>LoRA Unlearns More and Retains More (Student Abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to increasing privacy regulations and regulatory compliance, Machine Unlearning (MU) has become essential. The goal of unlearning is to remove information related to a specific class from a model. Traditional approaches achieve exact unlearning by retraining the model on the remaining dataset, but incur high computational costs. This has driven the development of more efficient unlearning techniques, including model sparsification techniques, which boost computational efficiency, but degrade the model's performance on the remaining classes. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel method, PruneLoRA which introduces a new MU paradigm, termed prune first, then adapt, then unlearn. LoRA (Hu et al. 2022) reduces the need for large-scale parameter updates by applying low-rank updates to the model. We leverage LoRA to selectively modify a subset of the pruned model's parameters, thereby reducing the computational cost, memory requirements and improving the model's ability to retain performance on the remaining classes. Experimental Results across various metrics showcase that our method outperforms other approximate MU methods and bridges the gap between exact and approximate unlearning. Our code is available at https://github.com/vlgiitr/LoRA-Unlearn.</description>

      <title>AIGS: Generating Science from AI-Powered Automated Falsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid development of artificial intelligence has drastically accelerated the development of scientific discovery. Trained with large-scale observation data, deep neural networks extract the underlying patterns in an end-to-end manner and assist human researchers with highly-precised predictions in unseen scenarios. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the empowered autonomous agents enable scientists to gain help through interaction in different stages of their research, including but not limited to literature review, research ideation, idea implementation, and academic writing. However, AI researchers instantiated by foundation model empowered agents with full-process autonomy are still in their infancy. In this paper, we study $\textbf{AI-Generated Science}$ (AIGS), where agents independently and autonomously complete the entire research process and discover scientific laws. By revisiting the definition of scientific research, we argue that $\textit{falsification}$ is the essence of both human research process and the design of an AIGS system. Through the lens of falsification, prior systems attempting towards AI-Generated Science either lack the part in their design, or rely heavily on existing verification engines that narrow the use in specialized domains. In this work, we propose Baby-AIGS as a baby-step demonstration of a full-process AIGS system, which is a multi-agent system with agents in roles representing key research process. By introducing FalsificationAgent, which identify and then verify possible scientific discoveries, we empower the system with explicit falsification. Experiments on three tasks preliminarily show that Baby-AIGS could produce meaningful scientific discoveries, though not on par with experienced human researchers. Finally, we discuss on the limitations of current Baby-AIGS, actionable insights, and related ethical issues in detail.</description>

      <title>ModeSeq: Taming Sparse Multimodal Motion Prediction with Sequential Mode Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anticipating the multimodality of future events lays the foundation for safe autonomous driving. However, multimodal motion prediction for traffic agents has been clouded by the lack of multimodal ground truth. Existing works predominantly adopt the winner-take-all training strategy to tackle this challenge, yet still suffer from limited trajectory diversity and misaligned mode confidence. While some approaches address these limitations by generating excessive trajectory candidates, they necessitate a post-processing stage to identify the most representative modes, a process lacking universal principles and compromising trajectory accuracy. We are thus motivated to introduce ModeSeq, a new multimodal prediction paradigm that models modes as sequences. Unlike the common practice of decoding multiple plausible trajectories in one shot, ModeSeq requires motion decoders to infer the next mode step by step, thereby more explicitly capturing the correlation between modes and significantly enhancing the ability to reason about multimodality. Leveraging the inductive bias of sequential mode prediction, we also propose the Early-Match-Take-All (EMTA) training strategy to diversify the trajectories further. Without relying on dense mode prediction or rule-based trajectory selection, ModeSeq considerably improves the diversity of multimodal output while attaining satisfactory trajectory accuracy, resulting in balanced performance on motion prediction benchmarks. Moreover, ModeSeq naturally emerges with the capability of mode extrapolation, which supports forecasting more behavior modes when the future is highly uncertain.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Mangrove Monitoring System Based on Deep Learning and Sentinel-2 Satellite Data in the UAE (2017-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mangroves play a crucial role in maintaining coastal ecosystem health and protecting biodiversity. Therefore, continuous mapping of mangroves is essential for understanding their dynamics. Earth observation imagery typically provides a cost-effective way to monitor mangrove dynamics. However, there is a lack of regional studies on mangrove areas in the UAE. This study utilizes the UNet++ deep learning model combined with Sentinel-2 multispectral data and manually annotated labels to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of densely distributed mangroves (coverage greater than 70%) in the UAE from 2017 to 2024, achieving an mIoU of 87.8% on the validation set. Results show that the total mangrove area in the UAE in 2024 was approximately 9,142.21 hectares, an increase of 2,061.33 hectares compared to 2017, with carbon sequestration increasing by approximately 194,383.42 tons. Abu Dhabi has the largest mangrove area and plays a dominant role in the UAE's mangrove growth, increasing by 1,855.6 hectares between 2017-2024, while other emirates have also contributed to mangrove expansion through stable and sustainable growth in mangrove areas. This comprehensive growth pattern reflects the collective efforts of all emirates in mangrove restoration.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distillers Are Good Label Denoisers In the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from noisy data has become essential for adapting deep learning models to real-world applications. Traditional methods often involve first evaluating the noise and then applying strategies such as discarding noisy samples, re-weighting, or re-labeling. However, these methods can fall into a vicious cycle when the initial noise evaluation is inaccurate, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages dataset distillation for noise removal. This method avoids the feedback loop common in existing techniques and enhances training efficiency, while also providing strong privacy protection through offline processing. We rigorously evaluate three representative dataset distillation methods (DATM, DANCE, and RCIG) under various noise conditions, including symmetric noise, asymmetric noise, and real-world natural noise. Our empirical findings reveal that dataset distillation effectively serves as a denoising tool in random noise scenarios but may struggle with structured asymmetric noise patterns, which can be absorbed into the distilled samples. Additionally, clean but challenging samples, such as those from tail classes in imbalanced datasets, may undergo lossy compression during distillation. Despite these challenges, our results highlight that dataset distillation holds significant promise for robust model training, especially in high-privacy environments where noise is prevalent.</description>

      <title>Reviving Dormant Memories: Investigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Language Models through Rationale-Guidance Difficulty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although substantial efforts have been made to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, the intrinsic mechanisms are not well understood. In this paper, we discover that when a forgetting model passively receives an externally provided partial appropriate rationale, its performance on the forgotten task can be restored. Furthermore, by simply adding a task-agnostic prefix to the original instruction, the forgetting model can actively generate an appropriate rationale to reach the correct answer. These findings suggest that the model does not actually ``forget'' the task knowledge; instead, the degraded performance can be attributed to the failure of the original instructions in guiding the model to generate the appropriate rationales. Based on this insight, we propose the Rationale-Guidance Difficulty metric to evaluate how effectively a given instruction guides the model in generating appropriate rationales. We apply this metric to optimize the allocation of replay data in replay-based continual learning algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our data allocation method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains better model plasticity simultaneously across models.</description>

      <title>METEOR: Evolutionary Journey of Large Language Models from Guidance to Self-Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model evolution enables learning from feedback to refine experiences and update skills, transforming models from having no domain knowledge to becoming domain experts. However, there is currently no unified and effective method for guiding this evolutionary process. To address this gap, we propose the Meteor method, which includes three training phases: weak-to-strong data distillation, iterative training, and self-evolution strategies. Each phase maximizes the model's inherent domain capabilities, allowing it to autonomously refine its domain knowledge and enhance performance. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy, completeness, relevance, coherence, and reliability across domain-specific tasks.</description>

      <title>Value Imprint: A Technique for Auditing the Human Values Embedded in RLHF Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are increasingly fine-tuned using RLHF datasets to align them with human preferences and values. However, very limited research has investigated which specific human values are operationalized through these datasets. In this paper, we introduce Value Imprint, a framework for auditing and classifying the human values embedded within RLHF datasets. To investigate the viability of this framework, we conducted three case study experiments by auditing the Anthropic/hh-rlhf, OpenAI WebGPT Comparisons, and Alpaca GPT-4-LLM datasets to examine the human values embedded within them. Our analysis involved a two-phase process. During the first phase, we developed a taxonomy of human values through an integrated review of prior works from philosophy, axiology, and ethics. Then, we applied this taxonomy to annotate 6,501 RLHF preferences. During the second phase, we employed the labels generated from the annotation as ground truth data for training a transformer-based machine learning model to audit and classify the three RLHF datasets. Through this approach, we discovered that information-utility values, including Wisdom/Knowledge and Information Seeking, were the most dominant human values within all three RLHF datasets. In contrast, prosocial and democratic values, including Well-being, Justice, and Human/Animal Rights, were the least represented human values. These findings have significant implications for developing language models that align with societal values and norms. We contribute our datasets to support further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Introducing Milabench: Benchmarking Accelerators for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI workloads, particularly those driven by deep learning, are introducing novel usage patterns to high-performance computing (HPC) systems that are not comprehensively captured by standard HPC benchmarks. As one of the largest academic research centers dedicated to deep learning, Mila identified the need to develop a custom benchmarking suite to address the diverse requirements of its community, which consists of over 1,000 researchers. This report introduces Milabench, the resulting benchmarking suite. Its design was informed by an extensive literature review encompassing 867 papers, as well as surveys conducted with Mila researchers. This rigorous process led to the selection of 26 primary benchmarks tailored for procurement evaluations, alongside 16 optional benchmarks for in-depth analysis. We detail the design methodology, the structure of the benchmarking suite, and provide performance evaluations using GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel. The Milabench suite is open source and can be accessed at github.com/mila-iqia/milabench.</description>

      <title>Coverage-Constrained Human-AI Cooperation with Multiple Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-AI cooperative classification (HAI-CC) approaches aim to develop hybrid intelligent systems that enhance decision-making in various high-stakes real-world scenarios by leveraging both human expertise and AI capabilities. Current HAI-CC methods primarily focus on learning-to-defer (L2D), where decisions are deferred to human experts, and learning-to-complement (L2C), where AI and human experts make predictions cooperatively. However, a notable research gap remains in effectively exploring both L2D and L2C under diverse expert knowledge to improve decision-making, particularly when constrained by the cooperation cost required to achieve a target probability for AI-only selection (i.e., coverage). In this paper, we address this research gap by proposing the Coverage-constrained Learning to Defer and Complement with Specific Experts (CL2DC) method. CL2DC makes final decisions through either AI prediction alone or by deferring to or complementing a specific expert, depending on the input data. Furthermore, we propose a coverage-constrained optimisation to control the cooperation cost, ensuring it approximates a target probability for AI-only selection. This approach enables an effective assessment of system performance within a specified budget. Also, CL2DC is designed to address scenarios where training sets contain multiple noisy-label annotations without any clean-label references. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CL2DC achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art HAI-CC methods.</description>

      <title>Transmission Line Outage Probability Prediction Under Extreme Events Using Peter-Clark Bayesian Structural Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a notable increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. With a rising number of power outages caused by these events, accurate prediction of power line outages is essential for safe and reliable operation of power grids. The Bayesian network is a probabilistic model that is very effective for predicting line outages under weather-related uncertainties. However, most existing studies in this area offer general risk assessments, but fall short of providing specific outage probabilities. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for predicting transmission line outage probabilities using a Bayesian network combined with Peter-Clark (PC) structural learning. Our approach not only enables precise outage probability calculations, but also demonstrates better scalability and robust performance, even with limited data. Case studies using data from BPA and NOAA show the effectiveness of this approach, while comparisons with several existing methods further highlight its advantages.</description>

      <title>The Generalization Error of Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the method of gaps, a technique for deriving closed-form expressions in terms of information measures for the generalization error of machine learning algorithms is introduced. The method relies on two central observations: $(a)$~The generalization error is an average of the variation of the expected empirical risk with respect to changes on the probability measure (used for expectation); and~$(b)$~these variations, also referred to as gaps, exhibit closed-form expressions in terms of information measures. The expectation of the empirical risk can be either with respect to a measure on the models (with a fixed dataset) or with respect to a measure on the datasets (with a fixed model), which results in two variants of the method of gaps. The first variant, which focuses on the gaps of the expected empirical risk with respect to a measure on the models, appears to be the most general, as no assumptions are made on the distribution of the datasets. The second variant develops under the assumption that datasets are made of independent and identically distributed data points. All existing exact expressions for the generalization error of machine learning algorithms can be obtained with the proposed method. Also, this method allows obtaining numerous new exact expressions, which improves the understanding of the generalization error; establish connections with other areas in statistics, e.g., hypothesis testing; and potentially, might guide algorithm designs.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Evaluation Metric Discrepancies across Programming Languages and Their Components: Need for Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates metrics for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, correlation analysis, statistical tests, segmentation, and image-to-image (I2I) translation. Metrics were compared across Python libraries, R packages, and Matlab functions to assess their consistency and highlight discrepancies. The findings underscore the need for a unified roadmap to standardize metrics, ensuring reliable and reproducible ML evaluations across platforms. This study examined a wide range of evaluation metrics across various tasks and found only some to be consistent across platforms, such as (i) Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, Cohens Kappa, F-beta Score, MCC, Geometric Mean, AUC, and Log Loss in binary classification; (ii) Accuracy, Cohens Kappa, and F-beta Score in multi-class classification; (iii) MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, Explained Variance, Median AE, MSLE, and Huber in regression; (iv) Davies-Bouldin Index and Calinski-Harabasz Index in clustering; (v) Pearson, Spearman, Kendall's Tau, Mutual Information, Distance Correlation, Percbend, Shepherd, and Partial Correlation in correlation analysis; (vi) Paired t-test, Chi-Square Test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis Test, Shapiro-Wilk Test, Welchs t-test, and Bartlett's test in statistical tests; (vii) Accuracy, Precision, and Recall in 2D segmentation; (viii) Accuracy in 3D segmentation; (ix) MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-Squared in 2D-I2I translation; and (x) MAE, MSE, and RMSE in 3D-I2I translation. Given observation of discrepancies in a number of metrics (e.g. precision, recall and F1 score in binary classification, WCSS in clustering, multiple statistical tests, and IoU in segmentation, amongst multiple metrics), this study concludes that ML evaluation metrics require standardization and recommends that future research use consistent metrics for different tasks to effectively compare ML techniques and solutions.</description>

Abstract: Throughout the scientific computing space, deep learning algorithms have shown excellent performance in a wide range of applications. As these deep neural networks (DNNs) continue to mature, the necessary compute required to train them has continued to grow. Today, modern DNNs require millions of FLOPs and days to weeks of training to generate a well-trained model. The training times required for DNNs are oftentimes a bottleneck in DNN research for a variety of deep learning applications, and as such, accelerating and scaling DNN training enables more robust and accelerated research. To that end, in this work, we explore utilizing the NRP Nautilus HyperCluster to automate and scale deep learning model training for three separate applications of DNNs, including overhead object detection, burned area segmentation, and deforestation detection. In total, 234 deep neural models are trained on Nautilus, for a total time of 4,040 hours</description>

      <title>Fast Convergence of Softmax Policy Mirror Ascent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural policy gradient (NPG) is a common policy optimization algorithm and can be viewed as mirror ascent in the space of probabilities. Recently, Vaswani et al. [2021] introduced a policy gradient method that corresponds to mirror ascent in the dual space of logits. We refine this algorithm, removing its need for a normalization across actions and analyze the resulting method (referred to as SPMA). For tabular MDPs, we prove that SPMA with a constant step-size matches the linear convergence of NPG and achieves a faster convergence than constant step-size (accelerated) softmax policy gradient. To handle large state-action spaces, we extend SPMA to use a log-linear policy parameterization. Unlike that for NPG, generalizing SPMA to the linear function approximation (FA) setting does not require compatible function approximation. Unlike MDPO, a practical generalization of NPG, SPMA with linear FA only requires solving convex softmax classification problems. We prove that SPMA achieves linear convergence to the neighbourhood of the optimal value function. We extend SPMA to handle non-linear FA and evaluate its empirical performance on the MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that SPMA consistently achieves similar or better performance compared to MDPO, PPO and TRPO.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Graph Attention Probabilistic Walk Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs inherently capture dependencies between nodes or variables through their topological structure, with paths between any two nodes indicating a sequential dependency on the nodes traversed. Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) leverage these latent relationships embedded in graph structures, and have become widely adopted across diverse applications. However, many existing methods predominantly rely on local information within the $1$-hop neighborhood. This approach has notable limitations; for example, $1$-hop aggregation schemes inherently lose long-distance information, and are limited in expressive power as defined by the $k$-Weisfeiler-Leman ($k$-WL) isomorphism test. To address these issues, we propose the Higher Order Graphical Attention (HoGA) module, which assigns weights to variable-length paths sampled based on feature-vector diversity, effectively reconstructing the $k$-hop neighborhood. HoGA represents higher-order relationships as a robust form of self-attention, applicable to any single-hop attention mechanism. In empirical studies, applying HoGA to existing attention-based models consistently leads to significant accuracy improvements on benchmark node classification datasets. Furthermore, we observe that the performance degradation typically associated with additional message-passing steps may be mitigated.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of High-Dimensional Regression Coefficients by Comparison with Linearized Compressing Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear regression is often deemed inherently interpretable; however, challenges arise for high-dimensional data. We focus on further understanding how linear regression approximates nonlinear responses from high-dimensional functional data, motivated by predicting cycle life for lithium-ion batteries. We develop a linearization method to derive feature coefficients, which we compare with the closest regression coefficients of the path of regression solutions. We showcase the methods on battery data case studies where a single nonlinear compressing feature, $g\colon \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathbb{R}$, is used to construct a synthetic response, $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}$. This unifying view of linear regression and compressing features for high-dimensional functional data helps to understand (1) how regression coefficients are shaped in the highly regularized domain and how they relate to linearized feature coefficients and (2) how the shape of regression coefficients changes as a function of regularization to approximate nonlinear responses by exploiting local structures.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Corrections and the Leveraging of Reinforcement Learning to Enhance Triangle Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial examples represent a serious issue for the application of machine learning models in many sensitive domains. For generating adversarial examples, decision based black-box attacks are one of the most practical techniques as they only require query access to the model. One of the most recently proposed state-of-the-art decision based black-box attacks is Triangle Attack (TA). In this paper, we offer a high-level description of TA and explain potential theoretical limitations. We then propose a new decision based black-box attack, Triangle Attack with Reinforcement Learning (TARL). Our new attack addresses the limits of TA by leveraging reinforcement learning. This creates an attack that can achieve similar, if not better, attack accuracy than TA with half as many queries on state-of-the-art classifiers and defenses across ImageNet and CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>Molecule Generation with Fragment Retrieval Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragment-based drug discovery, in which molecular fragments are assembled into new molecules with desirable biochemical properties, has achieved great success. However, many fragment-based molecule generation methods show limited exploration beyond the existing fragments in the database as they only reassemble or slightly modify the given ones. To tackle this problem, we propose a new fragment-based molecule generation framework with retrieval augmentation, namely Fragment Retrieval-Augmented Generation (f-RAG). f-RAG is based on a pre-trained molecular generative model that proposes additional fragments from input fragments to complete and generate a new molecule. Given a fragment vocabulary, f-RAG retrieves two types of fragments: (1) hard fragments, which serve as building blocks that will be explicitly included in the newly generated molecule, and (2) soft fragments, which serve as reference to guide the generation of new fragments through a trainable fragment injection module. To extrapolate beyond the existing fragments, f-RAG updates the fragment vocabulary with generated fragments via an iterative refinement process which is further enhanced with post-hoc genetic fragment modification. f-RAG can achieve an improved exploration-exploitation trade-off by maintaining a pool of fragments and expanding it with novel and high-quality fragments through a strong generative prior.</description>

      <title>Federated Contrastive Learning of Graph-Level Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-level representations (and clustering/classification based on these representations) are required in a variety of applications. Examples include identifying malicious network traffic, prediction of protein properties, and many others. Often, data has to stay in isolated local systems (i.e., cannot be centrally shared for analysis) due to a variety of considerations like privacy concerns, lack of trust between the parties, regulations, or simply because the data is too large to be shared sufficiently quickly. This points to the need for federated learning for graph-level representations, a topic that has not been explored much, especially in an unsupervised setting.
  Addressing this problem, this paper presents a new framework we refer to as Federated Contrastive Learning of Graph-level Representations (FCLG). As the name suggests, our approach builds on contrastive learning. However, what is unique is that we apply contrastive learning at two levels. The first application is for local unsupervised learning of graph representations. The second level is to address the challenge associated with data distribution variation (i.e. the ``Non-IID issue") when combining local models. Through extensive experiments on the downstream task of graph-level clustering, we demonstrate FCLG outperforms baselines (which apply existing federated methods on existing graph-level clustering methods) with significant margins.</description>

      <title>BALI: Learning Neural Networks via Bayesian Layerwise Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for learning Bayesian neural networks, treating them as a stack of multivariate Bayesian linear regression models. The main idea is to infer the layerwise posterior exactly if we know the target outputs of each layer. We define these pseudo-targets as the layer outputs from the forward pass, updated by the backpropagated gradients of the objective function. The resulting layerwise posterior is a matrix-normal distribution with a Kronecker-factorized covariance matrix, which can be efficiently inverted. Our method extends to the stochastic mini-batch setting using an exponential moving average over natural-parameter terms, thus gradually forgetting older data. The method converges in few iterations and performs as well as or better than leading Bayesian neural network methods on various regression, classification, and out-of-distribution detection benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Mechanism and Emergence of Stacked Attention Heads in Multi-Layer Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce the retrieval problem, a simple reasoning task that can be solved only by transformers with a minimum number of layers. The task has an adjustable difficulty that can further increase the required number of layers to any arbitrary value. I demonstrate that large language models can solve the task under different prompting formulations without any fine-tuning. To understand how transformers solve the retrieval problem, I train several transformers on a minimal formulation. I find that successful learning occurs only under the presence of an implicit curriculum. I uncover the learned mechanisms by studying the attention maps in the trained transformers. I also study the training process, uncovering that attention heads always emerge in a specific sequence.</description>

      <title>MMBind: Unleashing the Potential of Distributed and Heterogeneous Data for Multimodal Learning in IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal sensing systems are increasingly prevalent in various real-world applications. Most existing multimodal learning approaches heavily rely on training with a large amount of complete multimodal data. However, such a setting is impractical in real-world IoT sensing applications where data is typically collected by distributed nodes with heterogeneous data modalities, and is also rarely labeled. In this paper, we propose MMBind, a new framework for multimodal learning on distributed and heterogeneous IoT data. The key idea of MMBind is to construct a pseudo-paired multimodal dataset for model training by binding data from disparate sources and incomplete modalities through a sufficiently descriptive shared modality. We demonstrate that data of different modalities observing similar events, even captured at different times and locations, can be effectively used for multimodal training. Moreover, we propose an adaptive multimodal learning architecture capable of training models with heterogeneous modality combinations, coupled with a weighted contrastive learning approach to handle domain shifts among disparate data. Evaluations on ten real-world multimodal datasets highlight that MMBind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under varying data incompleteness and domain shift, and holds promise for advancing multimodal foundation model training in IoT applications.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification via Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for fine-grained uncertainty quantification (UQ) using a collision matrix. For a classification problem involving $K$ classes, the $K\times K$ collision matrix $S$ measures the inherent (aleatoric) difficulty in distinguishing between each pair of classes. In contrast to existing UQ methods, the collision matrix gives a much more detailed picture of the difficulty of classification. We discuss several possible downstream applications of the collision matrix, establish its fundamental mathematical properties, as well as show its relationship with existing UQ methods, including the Bayes error rate. We also address the new problem of estimating the collision matrix using one-hot labeled data. We propose a series of innovative techniques to estimate $S$. First, we learn a contrastive binary classifier which takes two inputs and determines if they belong to the same class. We then show that this contrastive classifier (which is PAC learnable) can be used to reliably estimate the Gramian matrix of $S$, defined as $G=S^TS$. Finally, we show that under very mild assumptions, $G$ can be used to uniquely recover $S$, a new result on stochastic matrices which could be of independent interest. Experimental results are also presented to validate our methods on several datasets.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Loss Functions as Topological Landscape Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In machine learning, a loss function measures the difference between model predictions and ground-truth (or target) values. For neural network models, visualizing how this loss changes as model parameters are varied can provide insights into the local structure of the so-called loss landscape (e.g., smoothness) as well as global properties of the underlying model (e.g., generalization performance). While various methods for visualizing the loss landscape have been proposed, many approaches limit sampling to just one or two directions, ignoring potentially relevant information in this extremely high-dimensional space. This paper introduces a new representation based on topological data analysis that enables the visualization of higher-dimensional loss landscapes. After describing this new topological landscape profile representation, we show how the shape of loss landscapes can reveal new details about model performance and learning dynamics, highlighting several use cases, including image segmentation (e.g., UNet) and scientific machine learning (e.g., physics-informed neural networks). Through these examples, we provide new insights into how loss landscapes vary across distinct hyperparameter spaces: we find that the topology of the loss landscape is simpler for better-performing models; and we observe greater variation in the shape of loss landscapes near transitions from low to high model performance.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Action Sequence for Data-Efficient Robot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents on robotic tasks typically requires a large number of training samples. This is because training data often consists of noisy trajectories, whether from exploration or human-collected demonstrations, making it difficult to learn value functions that understand the effect of taking each action. On the other hand, recent behavior-cloning (BC) approaches have shown that predicting a sequence of actions enables policies to effectively approximate noisy, multi-modal distributions of expert demonstrations. Can we use a similar idea for improving RL on robotic tasks? In this paper, we introduce a novel RL algorithm that learns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions. By explicitly training the value functions to learn the consequence of executing a series of current and future actions, our algorithm allows for learning useful value functions from noisy trajectories. We study our algorithm across various setups with sparse and dense rewards, and with or without demonstrations, spanning mobile bi-manual manipulation, whole-body control, and tabletop manipulation tasks from BiGym, HumanoidBench, and RLBench. We find that, by learning the critic network with action sequences, our algorithm outperforms various RL and BC baselines, in particular on challenging humanoid control tasks.</description>

      <title>UrbanDiT: A Foundation Model for Open-World Urban Spatio-Temporal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urban environment is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics arising from diverse human activities and interactions. Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scale up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse spatio-temporal data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three primary advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format, allowing to capture spatio-temporal dynamics across diverse scenarios of different cities; 2) With masking strategies and task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. These features allow UrbanDiT to achieves state-of-the-art performance in different domains such as transportation traffic, crowd flows, taxi demand, bike usage, and cellular traffic, across multiple cities and tasks. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain.</description>

      <title>SkillTree: Explainable Skill-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon Control Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in various research domains. However, its reliance on neural networks results in a lack of transparency, which limits its practical applications. To achieve explainability, decision trees have emerged as a popular and promising alternative to neural networks. Nonetheless, due to their limited expressiveness, traditional decision trees struggle with high-dimensional long-horizon continuous control tasks. In this paper, we proposes SkillTree, a novel framework that reduces complex continuous action spaces into discrete skill spaces. Our hierarchical approach integrates a differentiable decision tree within the high-level policy to generate skill embeddings, which subsequently guide the low-level policy in executing skills. By making skill decisions explainable, we achieve skill-level explainability, enhancing the understanding of the decision-making process in complex tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to skill-based neural networks in complex robotic arm control domains. Furthermore, SkillTree offers explanations at the skill level, thereby increasing the transparency of the decision-making process.</description>

      <title>Just KIDDIN: Knowledge Infusion and Distillation for Detection of INdecent Memes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toxicity identification in online multimodal environments remains a challenging task due to the complexity of contextual connections across modalities (e.g., textual and visual). In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) from Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) and knowledge infusion to enhance the performance of toxicity detection in hateful memes. Our approach extracts sub-knowledge graphs from ConceptNet, a large-scale commonsense Knowledge Graph (KG) to be infused within a compact VLM framework. The relational context between toxic phrases in captions and memes, as well as visual concepts in memes enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Experimental results from our study on two hate speech benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines across AU-ROC, F1, and Recall with improvements of 1.1%, 7%, and 35%, respectively. Given the contextual complexity of the toxicity detection task, our approach showcases the significance of learning from both explicit (i.e. KG) as well as implicit (i.e. LVLMs) contextual cues incorporated through a hybrid neurosymbolic approach. This is crucial for real-world applications where accurate and scalable recognition of toxic content is critical for creating safer online environments.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Inspired Cold Start with Sufficient Prior in Computerized Adaptive Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) aims to select the most appropriate questions based on the examinee's ability and is widely used in online education. However, existing CAT systems often lack initial understanding of the examinee's ability, requiring random probing questions. This can lead to poorly matched questions, extending the test duration and negatively impacting the examinee's mindset, a phenomenon referred to as the Cold Start with Insufficient Prior (CSIP) task. This issue occurs because CAT systems do not effectively utilize the abundant prior information about the examinee available from other courses on online platforms. These response records, due to the commonality of cognitive states across different knowledge domains, can provide valuable prior information for the target domain. However, no prior work has explored solutions for the CSIP task. In response to this gap, we propose Diffusion Cognitive States TransfeR Framework (DCSR), a novel domain transfer framework based on Diffusion Models (DMs) to address the CSIP task. Specifically, we construct a cognitive state transition bridge between domains, guided by the common cognitive states of examinees, encouraging the model to reconstruct the initial ability state in the target domain. To enrich the expressive power of the generated data, we analyze the causal relationships in the generation process from a causal perspective. Redundant and extraneous cognitive states can lead to limited transfer and negative transfer effects. Our DCSR can seamlessly apply the generated initial ability states in the target domain to existing question selection algorithms, thus improving the cold start performance of the CAT system. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that DCSR significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in addressing the CSIP task.</description>

      <title>DeTrigger: A Gradient-Centric Approach to Backdoor Attack Mitigation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving local data privacy, making it ideal for mobile and embedded systems. However, the decentralized nature of FL also opens vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, where adversaries implant trigger patterns to manipulate model predictions. In this paper, we propose DeTrigger, a scalable and efficient backdoor-robust federated learning framework that leverages insights from adversarial attack methodologies. By employing gradient analysis with temperature scaling, DeTrigger detects and isolates backdoor triggers, allowing for precise model weight pruning of backdoor activations without sacrificing benign model knowledge. Extensive evaluations across four widely used datasets demonstrate that DeTrigger achieves up to 251x faster detection than traditional methods and mitigates backdoor attacks by up to 98.9%, with minimal impact on global model accuracy. Our findings establish DeTrigger as a robust and scalable solution to protect federated learning environments against sophisticated backdoor threats.</description>

      <title>Contrast Similarity-Aware Dual-Pathway Mamba for Multivariate Time Series Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) data is generated through multiple sensors across various domains such as engineering application, health monitoring, and the internet of things, characterized by its temporal changes and high dimensional characteristics. Over the past few years, many studies have explored the long-range dependencies and similarities in MTS. However, long-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes and high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively and efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba). Firstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use temporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we construct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and short-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the information interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity features, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments on multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass diverse application scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method through both supervised and semi-supervised experiments on the MTS classification task.</description>

      <title>Hyper-parameter Optimization for Federated Learning with Step-wise Adaptive Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized learning approach that protects sensitive information by utilizing local model parameters rather than sharing clients' raw datasets. While this privacy-preserving method is widely employed across various applications, it still requires significant development and optimization. Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML) has been adapted for reducing the need for manual adjustments. Previous studies have explored the integration of AutoML with different FL algorithms to evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing FL settings. However, Automated FL (Auto-FL) faces additional challenges due to the involvement of a large cohort of clients and global training rounds between clients and the server, rendering the tuning process time-consuming and nearly impossible on resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., IoT devices). This paper investigates the deployment and integration of two lightweight Hyper-Parameter Optimization (HPO) tools, Raytune and Optuna, within the context of FL settings. A step-wise feedback mechanism has also been designed to accelerate the hyper-parameter tuning process and coordinate AutoML toolkits with the FL server. To this end, both local and global feedback mechanisms are integrated to limit the search space and expedite the HPO process. Further, a novel client selection technique is introduced to mitigate the straggler effect in Auto-FL. The selected hyper-parameter tuning tools are evaluated using two benchmark datasets, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10. Further, the paper discusses the essential properties of successful HPO tools, the integration mechanism with the FL pipeline, and the challenges posed by the distributed and heterogeneous nature of FL environments.</description>

      <title>A Review on Generative AI Models for Synthetic Medical Text, Time Series, and Longitudinal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a novel scoping review on the practical models for generating three different types of synthetic health records (SHRs): medical text, time series, and longitudinal data. The innovative aspects of the review, which incorporate study objectives, data modality, and research methodology of the reviewed studies, uncover the importance and the scope of the topic for the digital medicine context. In total, 52 publications met the eligibility criteria for generating medical time series (22), longitudinal data (17), and medical text (13). Privacy preservation was found to be the main research objective of the studied papers, along with class imbalance, data scarcity, and data imputation as the other objectives. The adversarial network-based, probabilistic, and large language models exhibited superiority for generating synthetic longitudinal data, time series, and medical texts, respectively. Finding a reliable performance measure to quantify SHR re-identification risk is the major research gap of the topic.</description>

      <title>libcll: an Extendable Python Toolkit for Complementary-Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complementary-label learning (CLL) is a weakly supervised learning paradigm for multiclass classification, where only complementary labels -- indicating classes an instance does not belong to -- are provided to the learning algorithm. Despite CLL's increasing popularity, previous studies highlight two main challenges: (1) inconsistent results arising from varied assumptions on complementary label generation, and (2) high barriers to entry due to the lack of a standardized evaluation platform across datasets and algorithms. To address these challenges, we introduce \texttt{libcll}, an extensible Python toolkit for CLL research. \texttt{libcll} provides a universal interface that supports a wide range of generation assumptions, both synthetic and real-world datasets, and key CLL algorithms. The toolkit is designed to mitigate inconsistencies and streamline the research process, with easy installation, comprehensive usage guides, and quickstart tutorials that facilitate efficient adoption and implementation of CLL techniques. Extensive ablation studies conducted with \texttt{libcll} demonstrate its utility in generating valuable insights to advance future CLL research.</description>

      <title>C$^{2}$INet: Realizing Incremental Trajectory Prediction with Prior-Aware Continual Causal Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agents in complex scenarios is crucial for applications like autonomous driving. However, existing methods often overlook environmental biases, which leads to poor generalization. Additionally, hardware constraints limit the use of large-scale data across environments, and continual learning settings exacerbate the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose the Continual Causal Intervention (C$^{2}$INet) method for generalizable multi-agent trajectory prediction within a continual learning framework. Using variational inference, we align environment-related prior with posterior estimator of confounding factors in the latent space, thereby intervening in causal correlations that affect trajectory representation. Furthermore, we store optimal variational priors across various scenarios using a memory queue, ensuring continuous debiasing during incremental task training. The proposed C$^{2}$INet enhances adaptability to diverse tasks while preserving previous task information to prevent catastrophic forgetting. It also incorporates pruning strategies to mitigate overfitting. Comparative evaluations on three real and synthetic complex datasets against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves reliable prediction performance, effectively mitigating confounding factors unique to different scenarios. This highlights the practical value of our method for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Attributed Graph Clustering in Collaborative Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method that partitions the nodes in a graph into different groups. Despite achieving significant progress in exploiting both attributed and structured data information, graph clustering methods often face practical challenges related to data isolation. Moreover, the absence of collaborative methods for graph clustering limits their effectiveness.
  In this paper, we propose a collaborative graph clustering framework for attributed graphs, supporting attributed graph clustering over vertically partitioned data with different participants holding distinct features of the same data. Our method leverages a novel technique that reduces the sample space, improving the efficiency of the attributed graph clustering method. Furthermore, we compare our method to its centralized counterpart under a proximity condition, demonstrating that the successful local results of each participant contribute to the overall success of the collaboration.
  We fully implement our approach and evaluate its utility and efficiency by conducting experiments on four public datasets. The results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy levels to centralized attributed graph clustering methods. Our collaborative graph clustering framework provides an efficient and effective solution for graph clustering challenges related to data isolation.</description>

      <title>Graph as a feature: improving node classification with non-neural graph-aware logistic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their message passing framework that leverages both structural and feature information, have become a standard method for solving graph-based machine learning problems. However, these approaches still struggle to generalise well beyond datasets that exhibit strong homophily, where nodes of the same class tend to connect. This limitation has led to the development of complex neural architectures that pose challenges in terms of efficiency and scalability. In response to these limitations, we focus on simpler and more scalable approaches and introduce Graph-aware Logistic Regression (GLR), a non-neural model designed for node classification tasks. Unlike traditional graph algorithms that use only a fraction of the information accessible to GNNs, our proposed model simultaneously leverages both node features and the relationships between entities. However instead of relying on message passing, our approach encodes each node's relationships as an additional feature vector, which is then combined with the node's self attributes. Extensive experimental results, conducted within a rigorous evaluation framework, show that our proposed GLR approach outperforms both foundational and sophisticated state-of-the-art GNN models in node classification tasks. Going beyond the traditional limited benchmarks, our experiments indicate that GLR increases generalisation ability while reaching performance gains in computation time up to two orders of magnitude compared to it best neural competitor.</description>

      <title>Learning from Label Proportions and Covariate-shifted Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications, especially due to lack of supervision or privacy concerns, the training data is grouped into bags of instances (feature-vectors) and for each bag we have only an aggregate label derived from the instance-labels in the bag. In learning from label proportions (LLP) the aggregate label is the average of the instance-labels in a bag, and a significant body of work has focused on training models in the LLP setting to predict instance-labels. In practice however, the training data may have fully supervised albeit covariate-shifted source data, along with the usual target data with bag-labels, and we wish to train a good instance-level predictor on the target domain. We call this the covariate-shifted hybrid LLP problem. Fully supervised covariate shifted data often has useful training signals and the goal is to leverage them for better predictive performance in the hybrid LLP setting. To achieve this, we develop methods for hybrid LLP which naturally incorporate the target bag-labels along with the source instance-labels, in the domain adaptation framework. Apart from proving theoretical guarantees bounding the target generalization error, we also conduct experiments on several publicly available datasets showing that our methods outperform LLP and domain adaptation baselines as well techniques from previous related work.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely acknowledged that the performance of Transformer models is exponentially related to their number of parameters and computational complexity. While approaches like Mixture of Experts (MoE) decouple parameter count from computational complexity, they still face challenges in inference due to high memory access costs. This work introduces UltraMem, incorporating large-scale, ultra-sparse memory layer to address these limitations. Our approach significantly reduces inference latency while maintaining model performance. We also investigate the scaling laws of this new architecture, demonstrating that it not only exhibits favorable scaling properties but outperforms traditional models. In our experiments, we train networks with up to 20 million memory slots. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art inference speed and model performance within a given computational budget.</description>

      <title>Non-IID data in Federated Learning: A Systematic Review with Taxonomy, Metrics, Methods, Frameworks and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have highlighted Federated Learning (FL) as a promising approach that enables multiple distributed users (so-called clients) to collectively train ML models without sharing their private data. While this privacy-preserving method shows potential, it struggles when data across clients is not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. The latter remains an unsolved challenge that can result in poorer model performance and slower training times. Despite the significance of non-IID data in FL, there is a lack of consensus among researchers about its classification and quantification. This systematic review aims to fill that gap by providing a detailed taxonomy for non-IID data, partition protocols, and metrics to quantify data heterogeneity. Additionally, we describe popular solutions to address non-IID data and standardized frameworks employed in FL with heterogeneous data. Based on our state-of-the-art review, we present key lessons learned and suggest promising future research directions.</description>

      <title>Empirical Privacy Evaluations of Generative and Predictive Machine Learning Models -- A review and challenges for practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data generators, when trained using privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy, promise to produce synthetic data with formal privacy guarantees, facilitating the sharing of sensitive data. However, it is crucial to empirically assess the privacy risks associated with the generated synthetic data before deploying generative technologies. This paper outlines the key concepts and assumptions underlying empirical privacy evaluation in machine learning-based generative and predictive models. Then, this paper explores the practical challenges for privacy evaluations of generative models for use cases with millions of training records, such as data from statistical agencies and healthcare providers. Our findings indicate that methods designed to verify the correct operation of the training algorithm are effective for large datasets, but they often assume an adversary that is unrealistic in many scenarios. Based on the findings, we highlight a crucial trade-off between the computational feasibility of the evaluation and the level of realism of the assumed threat model. Finally, we conclude with ideas and suggestions for future research.</description>

      <title>Comparing Prior and Learned Time Representations in Transformer Models of Timeseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What sets timeseries analysis apart from other machine learning exercises is that time representation becomes a primary aspect of the experiment setup, as it must adequately represent the temporal relations that are relevant for the application at hand. In the work described here we study wo different variations of the Transformer architecture: one where we use the fixed time representation proposed in the literature and one where the time representation is learned from the data. Our experiments use data from predicting the energy output of solar panels, a task that exhibits known periodicities (daily and seasonal) that is straight-forward to encode in the fixed time representation. Our results indicate that even in an experiment where the phenomenon is well-understood, it is difficult to encode prior knowledge due to side-effects that are difficult to mitigate. We conclude that research work is needed to work the human into the learning loop in ways that improve the robustness and trust-worthiness of the network.</description>

      <title>Regular-pattern-sensitive CRFs for Distant Label Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) are a common model component for sequence labeling tasks when modeling the interactions between different labels is important. However, the Markov assumption limits linear-chain CRFs to only directly modeling interactions between adjacent labels. Weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs) are a related approach which can be made to model distant label-label interactions, but exact label inference is intractable for these models in the general case, and the task of selecting an appropriate automaton structure for the desired interaction types poses a practical challenge. In this work, we present regular-pattern-sensitive CRFs (RPCRFs), a method of enriching standard linear-chain CRFs with the ability to learn long-distance label interactions which occur in user-specified patterns. This approach allows users to write regular-expression label patterns concisely specifying which types of interactions the model should take into account, allowing the model to learn from data whether and in which contexts these patterns occur. The result can be interpreted alternatively as a CRF augmented with additional, non-local potentials, or as a finite-state transducer whose structure is defined by a set of easily-interpretable patterns. Critically, unlike the general case for FSTs (and for non-chain CRFs), exact training and inference are tractable for many pattern sets. In this work, we detail how a RPCRF can be automatically constructed from a set of user-specified patterns, and demonstrate the model's effectiveness on synthetic data, showing how different types of patterns can capture different nonlocal dependency structures in label sequences.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs via Principled Synthetic Logic Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are capable of solving a wide range of tasks, yet they have struggled with reasoning. To address this, we propose $\textbf{Additional Logic Training (ALT)}$, which aims to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities by program-generated logical reasoning samples. We first establish principles for designing high-quality samples by integrating symbolic logic theory and previous empirical insights. Then, based on these principles, we construct a synthetic corpus named $\textbf{Formal Logic Deduction Diverse}$ ($\textbf{FLD}$$^{\times 2}$), comprising numerous samples of multi-step deduction with unknown facts, diverse reasoning rules, diverse linguistic expressions, and challenging distractors. Finally, we empirically show that ALT on FLD$^{\times2}$ substantially enhances the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including LLaMA-3.1-70B. Improvements include gains of up to 30 points on logical reasoning benchmarks, up to 10 points on math and coding benchmarks, and 5 points on the benchmark suite BBH.</description>

      <title>Transformer Neural Processes -- Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic processes model various natural phenomena from disease transmission to stock prices, but simulating and quantifying their uncertainty can be computationally challenging. For example, modeling a Gaussian Process with standard statistical methods incurs an $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ penalty, and even using state-of-the-art Neural Processes (NPs) incurs an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ penalty due to the attention mechanism. We introduce the Transformer Neural Process - Kernel Regression (TNP-KR), a new architecture that incorporates a novel transformer block we call a Kernel Regression Block (KRBlock), which reduces the computational complexity of attention in transformer-based Neural Processes (TNPs) from $\mathcal{O}((n_C+n_T)^2)$ to $O(n_C^2+n_Cn_T)$ by eliminating masked computations, where $n_C$ is the number of context, and $n_T$ is the number of test points, respectively, and a fast attention variant that further reduces all attention calculations to $\mathcal{O}(n_C)$ in space and time complexity. In benchmarks spanning such tasks as meta-regression, Bayesian optimization, and image completion, we demonstrate that the full variant matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods while training faster and scaling two orders of magnitude higher in number of test points, and the fast variant nearly matches that performance while scaling to millions of both test and context points on consumer hardware.</description>

      <title>Data Pruning in Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data pruning is the problem of identifying a core subset that is most beneficial to training and discarding the remainder. While pruning strategies are well studied for discriminative models like those used in classification, little research has gone into their application to generative models. Generative models aim to estimate the underlying distribution of the data, so presumably they should benefit from larger datasets. In this work we aim to shed light on the accuracy of this statement, specifically answer the question of whether data pruning for generative diffusion models could have a positive impact. Contrary to intuition, we show that eliminating redundant or noisy data in large datasets is beneficial particularly when done strategically. We experiment with several pruning methods including recent-state-of-art methods, and evaluate over CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. We demonstrate that a simple clustering method outperforms other sophisticated and computationally demanding methods. We further exhibit how we can leverage clustering to balance skewed datasets in an unsupervised manner to allow fair sampling for underrepresented populations in the data distribution, which is a crucial problem in generative models.</description>

      <title>Unlocking State-Tracking in Linear RNNs Through Negative Eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs) such as Mamba, RWKV, GLA, mLSTM, and DeltaNet have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers in large language modeling, offering linear scaling with sequence length and improved training efficiency. However, LRNNs struggle to perform state-tracking which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation or tracking a chess game. Even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs like LSTM handle effectively, cannot be solved by current LRNNs. Recently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like Mamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal state-transition matrices to $[0, 1]$ and that incorporating negative values can resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs, which have recently shown promise in models such as DeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while complex eigenvalues are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the range $[-1, 1]$. Our empirical results confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of models like Mamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks. Furthermore, pre-training LRNNs with an extended eigenvalue range for language modeling achieves comparable performance and stability while showing promise on code and math data. Our work enhances the expressivity of modern LRNNs, broadening their applicability without changing the cost of training or inference.</description>

      <title>Predicting Customer Satisfaction by Replicating the Survey Response Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many call centers, customer satisfaction (CSAT) is a key performance indicator (KPI). However, only a fraction of customers take the CSAT survey after the call, leading to a biased and inaccurate average CSAT value, and missed opportunities for coaching, follow-up, and rectification. Therefore, call centers can benefit from a model predicting customer satisfaction on calls where the customer did not complete the survey. Given that CSAT is a closely monitored KPI, it is critical to minimize any bias in the average predicted CSAT (pCSAT). In this paper, we introduce a method such that predicted CSAT (pCSAT) scores accurately replicate the distribution of survey CSAT responses for every call center with sufficient data in a live production environment. The method can be applied to many multiclass classification problems to improve the class balance and minimize its changes upon model updates.</description>

      <title>UMGAD: Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a critical task in graph machine learning, with the primary objective of identifying anomalous nodes that deviate significantly from the majority. This task is widely applied in various real-world scenarios, including fraud detection and social network analysis. However, existing GAD methods still face two major challenges: (1) They are often limited to detecting anomalies in single-type interaction graphs and struggle with multiple interaction types in multiplex heterogeneous graphs; (2) In unsupervised scenarios, selecting appropriate anomaly score thresholds remains a significant challenge for accurate anomaly detection. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Anomaly Detection method, named UMGAD. We first learn multi-relational correlations among nodes in multiplex heterogeneous graphs and capture anomaly information during node attribute and structure reconstruction through graph-masked autoencoder (GMAE). Then, to further weaken the influence of noise and redundant information on abnormal information extraction, we generate attribute-level and subgraph-level augmented-view graphs respectively, and perform attribute and structure reconstruction through GMAE. Finally, We learn to optimize node attributes and structural features through contrastive learning between original-view and augmented-view graphs to improve the model's ability to capture anomalies. Meanwhile, we also propose a new anomaly score threshold selection strategy, which allows the model to be independent of the ground truth in real unsupervised scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that our \model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 13.48% in AUC and 11.68% in Macro-F1 across all datasets.</description>

      <title>Provable unlearning in topic modeling and downstream tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms are increasingly important as legal concerns arise around the provenance of training data, but verifying the success of unlearning is often difficult. Provable guarantees for unlearning are often limited to supervised learning settings. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical guarantees for unlearning in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm by studying topic models, simple bag-of-words language models that can be adapted to solve downstream tasks like retrieval and classification. First, we design a provably effective unlearning algorithm for topic models that incurs a computational overhead independent of the size of the original dataset. Our analysis additionally quantifies the deletion capacity of the model -- i.e., the number of examples that can be unlearned without incurring a significant cost in model performance. Finally, we formally extend our analyses to account for adaptation to a given downstream task. In particular, we design an efficient algorithm to perform unlearning after fine-tuning the topic model via a linear head. Notably, we show that it is easier to unlearn pre-training data from models that have been fine-tuned to a particular task, and one can unlearn this data without modifying the base model.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Manifold of Neural Networks Using Diffusion Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing motivation from the manifold hypothesis, which posits that most high-dimensional data lies on or near low-dimensional manifolds, we apply manifold learning to the space of neural networks. We learn manifolds where datapoints are neural networks by introducing a distance between the hidden layer representations of the neural networks. These distances are then fed to the non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm PHATE to create a manifold of neural networks. We characterize this manifold using features of the representation, including class separation, hierarchical cluster structure, spectral entropy, and topological structure. Our analysis reveals that high-performing networks cluster together in the manifold, displaying consistent embedding patterns across all these features. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this approach for guiding hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search by sampling from the manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data is often sparse and unevenly distributed due to the high costs and logistical challenges associated with deploying physical seismometers, limiting the application of Machine Learning (ML) in earthquake analysis. To address this gap, we introduce PyAWD, a Python library designed to generate high-resolution synthetic datasets simulating spatio-temporal acoustic wave propagation in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional heterogeneous media. By allowing fine control over parameters such as wave speed, external forces, spatial and temporal discretization, and media composition, PyAWD enables the creation of ML-scale datasets that capture the complexity of seismic wave behavior. We illustrate the library's potential with an epicenter retrieval task, showcasing its suitability for designing complex, accurate seismic problems that support advanced ML approaches in the absence or lack of dense real-world data.</description>

      <title>DLBacktrace: A Model Agnostic Explainability for any Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has led to increasingly sophisticated deep learning models, which frequently operate as opaque 'black boxes' with limited transparency in their decision-making processes. This lack of interpretability presents considerable challenges, especially in high-stakes applications where understanding the rationale behind a model's outputs is as essential as the outputs themselves. This study addresses the pressing need for interpretability in AI systems, emphasizing its role in fostering trust, ensuring accountability, and promoting responsible deployment in mission-critical fields. To address the interpretability challenge in deep learning, we introduce DLBacktrace, an innovative technique developed by the AryaXAI team to illuminate model decisions across a wide array of domains, including simple Multi Layer Perceptron (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision Models, and more.
  We provide a comprehensive overview of the DLBacktrace algorithm and present benchmarking results, comparing its performance against established interpretability methods, such as SHAP, LIME, GradCAM, Integrated Gradients, SmoothGrad, and Attention Rollout, using diverse task-based metrics. The proposed DLBacktrace technique is compatible with various model architectures built in PyTorch and TensorFlow, supporting models like Llama 3.2, other NLP architectures such as BERT and LSTMs, computer vision models like ResNet and U-Net, as well as custom deep neural network (DNN) models for tabular data. This flexibility underscores DLBacktrace's adaptability and effectiveness in enhancing model transparency across a broad spectrum of applications. The library is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/AryaXAI/DLBacktrace .</description>

      <title>Auto-Evaluation with Few Labels through Post-hoc Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continually evaluating large generative models provides a unique challenge. Often, human annotations are necessary to evaluate high-level properties of these models (e.g. in text or images). However, collecting human annotations of samples can be resource intensive, and using other machine learning systems to provide the annotations, or automatic evaluation, can introduce systematic errors into the evaluation. The Prediction Powered Inference (PPI) framework provides a way of leveraging both the statistical power of automatic evaluation and a small pool of labelled data to produce a low-variance, unbiased estimate of the quantity being evaluated for. However, most work on PPI considers a relatively sizable set of labelled samples, which is not always practical to obtain. To this end, we present two new PPI-based techniques that leverage robust regressors to produce even lower variance estimators in the few-label regime.</description>

Abstract: Monitoring agricultural activities is important to ensure food security. Remote sensing plays a significant role for large-scale continuous monitoring of cultivation activities. Time series remote sensing data were used for the generation of the cropping pattern. Classification algorithms are used to classify crop patterns and mapped agriculture land used. Some conventional classification methods including support vector machine (SVM) and decision trees were applied for crop pattern recognition. However, in this paper, we are proposing Deep Neural Network (DNN) based classification to improve the performance of crop pattern recognition and make a comparative analysis with two (2) other machine learning approaches including Naive Bayes and Random Forest.</description>

      <title>IMUVIE: Pickup Timeline Action Localization via Motion Movies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Falls among seniors due to difficulties with tasks such as picking up objects pose significant health and safety risks, impacting quality of life and independence. Reliable, accessible assessment tools are critical for early intervention but often require costly clinic-based equipment and trained personnel, limiting their use in daily life. Existing wearable-based pickup measurement solutions address some needs but face limitations in generalizability.
  We present IMUVIE, a wearable system that uses motion movies and a machine-learning model to automatically detect and measure pickup events, providing a practical solution for frequent monitoring. IMUVIE's design principles-data normalization, occlusion handling, and streamlined visuals-enhance model performance and are adaptable to tasks beyond pickup classification.
  In rigorous leave one subject out cross validation evaluations, IMUVIE achieves exceptional window level localization accuracy of 91-92% for pickup action classification on 256,291 motion movie frame candidates while maintaining an event level recall of 97% when evaluated on 129 pickup events. IMUVIE has strong generalization and performs well on unseen subjects. In an interview survey, IMUVIE demonstrated strong user interest and trust, with ease of use identified as the most critical factor for adoption. IMUVIE offers a practical, at-home solution for fall risk assessment, facilitating early detection of movement deterioration, and supporting safer, independent living for seniors.</description>

      <title>Attribute Inference Attacks for Federated Regression Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients, such as mobile phones and IoT devices, to collaboratively train a global machine learning model while keeping their data localized. However, recent studies have revealed that the training phase of FL is vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, such as attribute inference attacks (AIA), where adversaries exploit exchanged messages and auxiliary public information to uncover sensitive attributes of targeted clients. While these attacks have been extensively studied in the context of classification tasks, their impact on regression tasks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing novel model-based AIAs specifically designed for regression tasks in FL environments. Our approach considers scenarios where adversaries can either eavesdrop on exchanged messages or directly interfere with the training process. We benchmark our proposed attacks against state-of-the-art methods using real-world datasets. The results demonstrate a significant increase in reconstruction accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous client datasets, a common scenario in FL. The efficacy of our model-based AIAs makes them better candidates for empirically quantifying privacy leakage for federated regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning multivariate Gaussians with imperfect advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of distribution learning within the framework of learning-augmented algorithms. In this setting, we explore the scenario where a probability distribution is provided as potentially inaccurate advice on the true, unknown distribution. Our objective is to develop learning algorithms whose sample complexity decreases as the quality of the advice improves, thereby surpassing standard learning lower bounds when the advice is sufficiently accurate.
  Specifically, we demonstrate that this outcome is achievable for the problem of learning a multivariate Gaussian distribution $N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$ in the PAC learning setting. Classically, in the advice-free setting, $\tilde{\Theta}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are sufficient and worst case necessary to learn $d$-dimensional Gaussians up to TV distance $\varepsilon$ with constant probability. When we are additionally given a parameter $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}$ as advice, we show that $\tilde{O}(d^{2-\beta}/\varepsilon^2)$ samples suffices whenever $\| \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1/2} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1/2} - \boldsymbol{I_d} \|_1 \leq \varepsilon d^{1-\beta}$ (where $\|\cdot\|_1$ denotes the entrywise $\ell_1$ norm) for any $\beta &gt; 0$, yielding a polynomial improvement over the advice-free setting.</description>

      <title>Heuristic-Free Multi-Teacher Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Teacher2Task, a novel framework for multi-teacher learning that eliminates the need for manual aggregation heuristics. Existing multi-teacher methods typically rely on such heuristics to combine predictions from multiple teachers, often resulting in sub-optimal aggregated labels and the propagation of aggregation errors. Teacher2Task addresses these limitations by introducing teacher-specific input tokens and reformulating the training process. Instead of relying on aggregated labels, the framework transforms the training data, consisting of ground truth labels and annotations from N teachers, into N+1 distinct tasks: N auxiliary tasks that predict the labeling styles of the N individual teachers, and one primary task that focuses on the ground truth labels. This approach, drawing upon principles from multiple learning paradigms, demonstrates strong empirical results across a range of architectures, modalities, and tasks.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Positional Encodings for GNNs and Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers (GTs) have been driven by innovations in architectures and Positional Encodings (PEs), which are critical for augmenting node features and capturing graph topology. PEs are essential for GTs, where topological information would otherwise be lost without message-passing. However, PEs are often tested alongside novel architectures, making it difficult to isolate their effect on established models. To address this, we present a comprehensive benchmark of PEs in a unified framework that includes both message-passing GNNs and GTs. We also establish theoretical connections between MPNNs and GTs and introduce a sparsified GRIT attention mechanism to examine the influence of global connectivity. Our findings demonstrate that previously untested combinations of GNN architectures and PEs can outperform existing methods and offer a more comprehensive picture of the state-of-the-art. To support future research and experimentation in our framework, we make the code publicly available.</description>

      <title>MoE-Lightning: High-Throughput MoE Inference on Memory-constrained GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models, particularly Mixture of Experts (MoE), on resource-constrained platforms presents significant challenges, especially in terms of computational efficiency and memory utilization. The MoE architecture, renowned for its ability to increase model capacity without a proportional increase in inference cost, greatly reduces the token generation latency compared with dense models. However, the large model size makes MoE models inaccessible to individuals without high-end GPUs. In this paper, we propose a high-throughput MoE batch inference system, that significantly outperforms past work. MoE-Lightning introduces a novel CPU-GPU-I/O pipelining schedule, CGOPipe, with paged weights to achieve high resource utilization, and a performance model, HRM, based on a Hierarchical Roofline Model we introduce to help find policies with higher throughput than existing systems. MoE-Lightning can achieve up to 10.3x higher throughput than state-of-the-art offloading-enabled LLM inference systems for Mixtral 8x7B on a single T4 GPU (16GB). When the theoretical system throughput is bounded by the GPU memory, MoE-Lightning can reach the throughput upper bound with 2-3x less CPU memory, significantly increasing resource utilization. MoE-Lightning also supports efficient batch inference for much larger MoEs (e.g., Mixtral 8x22B and DBRX) on multiple low-cost GPUs (e.g., 2-4 T4).</description>

      <title>Robust Graph Neural Networks for Stability Analysis in Dynamic Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current context of accelerated globalization and digitalization, the complexity and uncertainty of financial markets are increasing, and the identification and prevention of economic risks have become a key link in maintaining the stability of the financial system. Traditional risk identification methods often have limitations because they are difficult to cope with the multi-level and dynamically changing complex relationships in financial networks. With the rapid development of financial technology, graph neural network (GNN) technology, as an emerging deep learning method, has gradually shown great potential in the field of financial risk management. GNN can map transaction behaviors, financial institutions, individuals, and their interactive relationships in financial networks into graph structures, and effectively capture potential patterns and abnormal signals in financial data through embedded representation learning. Using this technology, financial institutions can extract valuable information from complex transaction networks, identify hidden dangers or abnormal behaviors that may cause systemic risks in a timely manner, optimize decision-making processes, and improve the accuracy of risk warnings. This paper explores the economic risk identification algorithm based on the GNN algorithm, aiming to provide financial institutions and regulators with more intelligent technical tools to help maintain the security and stability of the financial market. Improving the efficiency of economic risk identification through innovative technical means is expected to further enhance the risk resistance of the financial system and lay the foundation for building a robust global financial system.</description>

      <title>LUTMUL: Exceed Conventional FPGA Roofline Limit by LUT-based Efficient Multiplication for Neural Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For FPGA-based neural network accelerators, digital signal processing (DSP) blocks have traditionally been the cornerstone for handling multiplications. This paper introduces LUTMUL, which harnesses the potential of look-up tables (LUTs) for performing multiplications. The availability of LUTs typically outnumbers that of DSPs by a factor of 100, offering a significant computational advantage. By exploiting this advantage of LUTs, our method demonstrates a potential boost in the performance of FPGA-based neural network accelerators with a reconfigurable dataflow architecture. Our approach challenges the conventional peak performance on DSP-based accelerators and sets a new benchmark for efficient neural network inference on FPGAs. Experimental results demonstrate that our design achieves the best inference speed among all FPGA-based accelerators, achieving a throughput of 1627 images per second and maintaining a top-1 accuracy of 70.95% on the ImageNet dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing percentage of elderly people and care home admissions, there is an urgent need for the development of fall detection and fall prevention technologies. This work presents, for the first time, the use of machine learning techniques to recognize postural movements exclusively from Photoplethysmography (PPG) data. To achieve this goal, a device was developed for reading the PPG signal, segmenting the PPG signals into individual pulses, extracting pulse morphology and homeostatic characteristic features, and evaluating different ML algorithms. Investigations into different postural movements (stationary, sitting to standing, and lying to standing) were performed by 11 participants. The results of these investigations provided insight into the differences in homeostasis after the movements in the PPG signal. Various machine learning approaches were used for classification, and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was found to be the best classifier, with a testing accuracy of 85.2\% and an F1 score of 78\% from experimental results.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Wrist PPG Analysis for Reliable Hypertension Risk Screening Using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Traditional blood pressure monitoring methods are cumbersome and inadequate for continuous tracking, prompting the development of PPG-based cuffless blood pressure monitoring wearables. This study leverages deep learning models, including ResNet and Transformer, to analyze wrist PPG data collected with a smartwatch for efficient hypertension risk screening, eliminating the need for handcrafted PPG features. Using the Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) longitudinal dataset of 448 subjects and five-fold cross-validation, our model was trained on over 68k spot-check instances from 358 subjects and tested on real-world continuous recordings of 90 subjects. The compact ResNet model with 0.124M parameters performed significantly better than traditional machine learning methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between healthy and abnormal cases in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach for Biomedical Signal Processing in CPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a critical, life-saving intervention aimed at restoring blood circulation and breathing in individuals experiencing cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. Accurate and real-time analysis of biomedical signals during CPR is essential for monitoring and decision-making, from the pre-hospital stage to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, CPR signals are often corrupted by noise and artifacts, making precise interpretation challenging. Traditional denoising methods, such as filters, struggle to adapt to the varying and complex noise patterns present in CPR signals. Given the high-stakes nature of CPR, where rapid and accurate responses can determine survival, there is a pressing need for more robust and adaptive denoising techniques. In this context, an unsupervised machine learning (ML) methodology is particularly valuable, as it removes the dependence on labeled data, which can be scarce or impractical in emergency scenarios. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised ML approach for denoising CPR signals using a multi-modality framework, which leverages multiple signal sources to enhance the denoising process. The proposed approach not only improves noise reduction and signal fidelity but also preserves critical inter-signal correlations (0.9993) which is crucial for downstream tasks. Furthermore, it outperforms existing methods in an unsupervised context in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), making it highly effective for real-time applications. The integration of multi-modality further enhances the system's adaptability to various biomedical signals beyond CPR, improving both automated CPR systems and clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>MultiBalance: Multi-Objective Gradient Balancing in Industrial-Scale Multi-Task Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In industrial recommendation systems, multi-task learning (learning multiple tasks simultaneously on a single model) is a predominant approach to save training/serving resources and improve recommendation performance via knowledge transfer between the joint learning tasks. However, multi-task learning often suffers from negative transfer: one or several tasks are less optimized than training them separately. To carefully balance the optimization, we propose a gradient balancing approach called MultiBalance, which is suitable for industrial-scale multi-task recommendation systems. It balances the per-task gradients to alleviate the negative transfer, while saving the huge cost for grid search or manual explorations for appropriate task weights. Moreover, compared with prior work that normally balance the per-task gradients of shared parameters, MultiBalance is more efficient since only requiring to access per-task gradients with respect to the shared feature representations. We conduct experiments on Meta's large-scale ads and feeds multi-task recommendation system, and observe that MultiBalance achieves significant gains (e.g., 0.738% improvement for normalized entropy (NE)) with neutral training cost in Queries Per Second (QPS), which is significantly more efficient than prior methods that balance per-task gradients of shared parameters with 70~80% QPS degradation.</description>

      <title>CSP-Net: Common Spatial Pattern Empowered Neural Networks for EEG-Based Motor Imagery Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram-based motor imagery (MI) classification is an important paradigm of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces. Common spatial pattern (CSP), which exploits different energy distributions on the scalp while performing different MI tasks, is very popular in MI classification. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also achieved great success, due to their powerful learning capabilities. This paper proposes two CSP-empowered neural networks (CSP-Nets), which integrate knowledge-driven CSP filters with data-driven CNNs to enhance the performance in MI classification. CSP-Net-1 directly adds a CSP layer before a CNN to improve the input discriminability. CSP-Net-2 replaces a convolutional layer in CNN with a CSP layer. The CSP layer parameters in both CSP-Nets are initialized with CSP filters designed from the training data. During training, they can either be kept fixed or optimized using gradient descent. Experiments on four public MI datasets demonstrated that the two CSP-Nets consistently improved over their CNN backbones, in both within-subject and cross-subject classifications. They are particularly useful when the number of training samples is very small. Our work demonstrates the advantage of integrating knowledge-driven traditional machine learning with data-driven deep learning in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces.</description>

      <title>How Many Data are Enough? Optimization of Data Collection for Artifact Detection in EEG Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used neuroimaging technique known for its cost-effectiveness and user-friendliness. However, the presence of various artifacts, particularly biological artifacts like Electromyography (EMG) ones, leads to a poor signal-to-noise ratio, limiting the precision of analyses and applications. The currently reported EEG data cleaning performance largely depends on the data used for validation, and in the case of machine learning approaches, also on the data used for training. The data are typically gathered either by recruiting subjects to perform specific artifact tasks or by integrating existing datasets. Prevailing approaches, however, tend to rely on intuitive, concept-oriented data collection with minimal justification for the selection of artifacts and their quantities. Given the substantial costs associated with biological data collection and the pressing need for effective data utilization, we propose an optimization procedure for data-oriented data collection design using deep learning-based artifact detection. Approach. We apply a binary classification between artifact epochs (time intervals containing artifacts) and non-artifact epochs (time intervals containing no artifact) using three different architectures. Our aim is to minimize data collection efforts while preserving the cleaning efficiency. Main results. We were able to reduce the number of artifact tasks from twelve to three and decrease repetitions of isometric contraction tasks from ten to three or sometimes even just one. Significance. Our work addresses the need for effective data utilization in biological data collection, offering a systematic and dynamic quantitative approach. By providing clear justifications for the choices of artifacts and their quantity, we aim to guide future studies toward more effective and economical data collection in EEG and EMG research.</description>

      <title>HeartBERT: A Self-Supervised ECG Embedding Model for Efficient and Effective Medical Signal Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The HeartBert model is introduced with three primary objectives: reducing the need for labeled data, minimizing computational resources, and simultaneously improving performance in machine learning systems that analyze Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in natural language processing and enhanced with a self-supervised learning approach, the HeartBert model-built on the RoBERTa architecture-generates sophisticated embeddings tailored for ECG-based projects in the medical domain. To demonstrate the versatility, generalizability, and efficiency of the proposed model, two key downstream tasks have been selected: sleep stage detection and heartbeat classification.

      <title>F$^3$OCUS -- Federated Finetuning of Vision-Language Foundation Models with Optimal Client Layer Updating Strategy via Multi-objective Meta-Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective training of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on resource-constrained client devices in Federated Learning (FL) requires the usage of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. To this end, we demonstrate the impact of two factors \textit{viz.}, client-specific layer importance score that selects the most important VLM layers for fine-tuning and inter-client layer diversity score that encourages diverse layer selection across clients for optimal VLM layer selection. We first theoretically motivate and leverage the principal eigenvalue magnitude of layerwise Neural Tangent Kernels and show its effectiveness as client-specific layer importance score. Next, we propose a novel layer updating strategy dubbed F$^3$OCUS that jointly optimizes the layer importance and diversity factors by employing a data-free, multi-objective, meta-heuristic optimization on the server. We explore 5 different meta-heuristic algorithms and compare their effectiveness for selecting model layers and adapter layers towards PEFT-FL. Furthermore, we release a new MedVQA-FL dataset involving overall 707,962 VQA triplets and 9 modality-specific clients and utilize it to train and evaluate our method. Overall, we conduct more than 10,000 client-level experiments on 6 Vision-Language FL task settings involving 58 medical image datasets and 4 different VLM architectures of varying sizes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Phenome-wide causal proteomics enhance systemic lupus erythematosus flare prediction: A study in Asian populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by unpredictable flares. This study aimed to develop a novel proteomics-based risk prediction model specifically for Asian SLE populations to enhance personalized disease management and early intervention. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted over 48 weeks, including 139 SLE patients monitored every 12 weeks. Patients were classified into flare (n = 53) and non-flare (n = 86) groups. Baseline plasma samples underwent data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics analysis, and phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (PheWAS) was performed to evaluate causal relationships between proteins and clinical predictors. Logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models were used to integrate proteomic and clinical data for flare risk prediction. Results: Five proteins (SAA1, B4GALT5, GIT2, NAA15, and RPIA) were significantly associated with SLE Disease Activity Index-2K (SLEDAI-2K) scores and 1-year flare risk, implicating key pathways such as B-cell receptor signaling and platelet degranulation. SAA1 demonstrated causal effects on flare-related clinical markers, including hemoglobin and red blood cell counts. A combined model integrating clinical and proteomic data achieved the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.769), surpassing individual models. SAA1 was highlighted as a priority biomarker for rapid flare discrimination. Conclusion: The integration of proteomic and clinical data significantly improves flare prediction in Asian SLE patients. The identification of key proteins and their causal relationships with flare-related clinical markers provides valuable insights for proactive SLE management and personalized therapeutic approaches.</description>

      <title>Calibrated and Efficient Sampling-Free Confidence Estimation for LiDAR Scene Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable deep learning models require not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated confidence estimates to ensure dependable uncertainty estimation. This is crucial in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, which depend on rapid and precise semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds for real-time 3D scene understanding. In this work, we introduce a sampling-free approach for estimating well-calibrated confidence values for classification tasks, achieving alignment with true classification accuracy and significantly reducing inference time compared to sampling-based methods. Our evaluation using the Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) metric for LiDAR semantic segmentation shows that our approach maintains well-calibrated confidence values while achieving increased processing speed compared to a sampling baseline. Additionally, reliability diagrams reveal that our method produces underconfidence rather than overconfident predictions, an advantage for safety-critical applications. Our sampling-free approach offers well-calibrated and time-efficient predictions for LiDAR scene semantic segmentation.</description>

      <title>Understanding Chain-of-Thought in LLMs through Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in complex reasoning tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, allowing models to break down problems into manageable sub-tasks. However, existing CoT evaluation techniques either require annotated CoT data or fall short in accurately assessing intermediate reasoning steps, leading to high rates of false positives. In this paper, we formalize CoT reasoning in LLMs through an information-theoretic lens. Specifically, our framework quantifies the `information gain' at each reasoning step, enabling the identification of failure modes in LLMs without the need for expensive annotated datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on toy and GSM-8K data, where it significantly outperforms existing outcome-based methods by providing more accurate insights into model performance on individual tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multichannel extension to the RVQGAN neural coding method is proposed, and realized for data-driven compression of third-order Ambisonics audio. The input- and output layers of the generator and discriminator models are modified to accept multiple (16) channels without increasing the model bitrate. We also propose a loss function for accounting for spatial perception in immersive reproduction, and transfer learning from single-channel models. Listening test results with 7.1.4 immersive playback show that the proposed extension is suitable for coding scene-based, 16-channel Ambisonics content with good quality at 16 kbit/s.</description>

      <title>Active learning for efficient discovery of optimal gene combinations in the combinatorial perturbation space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of novel combinatorial CRISPR screening technologies enables the identification of synergistic gene combinations on a large scale. This is crucial for developing novel and effective combination therapies, but the combinatorial space makes exhaustive experimentation infeasible. We introduce NAIAD, an active learning framework that efficiently discovers optimal gene pairs capable of driving cells toward desired cellular phenotypes. NAIAD leverages single-gene perturbation effects and adaptive gene embeddings that scale with the training data size, mitigating overfitting in small-sample learning while capturing complex gene interactions as more data is collected. Evaluated on four CRISPR combinatorial perturbation datasets totaling over 350,000 genetic interactions, NAIAD, trained on small datasets, outperforms existing models by up to 40\% relative to the second-best. NAIAD's recommendation system prioritizes gene pairs with the maximum predicted effects, resulting in the highest marginal gain in each AI-experiment round and accelerating discovery with fewer CRISPR experimental iterations. Our NAIAD framework (https://github.com/NeptuneBio/NAIAD) improves the identification of novel, effective gene combinations, enabling more efficient CRISPR library design and offering promising applications in genomics research and therapeutic development.</description>

      <title>SynCoTrain: A Dual Classifier PU-learning Framework for Synthesizability Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material discovery is a cornerstone of modern science, driving advancements in diverse disciplines from biomedical technology to climate solutions. Predicting synthesizability, a critical factor in realizing novel materials, remains a complex challenge due to the limitations of traditional heuristics and thermodynamic proxies. While stability metrics such as formation energy offer partial insights, they fail to account for kinetic factors and technological constraints that influence synthesis outcomes. These challenges are further compounded by the scarcity of negative data, as failed synthesis attempts are often unpublished or context-specific.
  We present SynCoTrain, a semi-supervised machine learning model designed to predict the synthesizability of materials. SynCoTrain employs a co-training framework leveraging two complementary graph convolutional neural networks: SchNet and ALIGNN. By iteratively exchanging predictions between classifiers, SynCoTrain mitigates model bias and enhances generalizability. Our approach uses Positive and Unlabeled (PU) Learning to address the absence of explicit negative data, iteratively refining predictions through collaborative learning.
  The model demonstrates robust performance, achieving high recall on internal and leave-out test sets. By focusing on oxide crystals, a well-characterized material family with extensive experimental data, we establish SynCoTrain as a reliable tool for predicting synthesizability while balancing dataset variability and computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of co-training to advance high-throughput materials discovery and generative research, offering a scalable solution to the challenge of synthesizability prediction.</description>

      <title>Regret-Free Reinforcement Learning for LTL Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising method to learn optimal control policies for systems with unknown dynamics. In particular, synthesizing controllers for safety-critical systems based on high-level specifications, such as those expressed in temporal languages like linear temporal logic (LTL), presents a significant challenge in control systems research. Current RL-based methods designed for LTL tasks typically offer only asymptotic guarantees, which provide no insight into the transient performance during the learning phase. While running an RL algorithm, it is crucial to assess how close we are to achieving optimal behavior if we stop learning.
  In this paper, we present the first regret-free online algorithm for learning a controller that addresses the general class of LTL specifications over Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a finite set of states and actions. We begin by proposing a regret-free learning algorithm to solve infinite-horizon reach-avoid problems. For general LTL specifications, we show that the synthesis problem can be reduced to a reach-avoid problem when the graph structure is known. Additionally, we provide an algorithm for learning the graph structure, assuming knowledge of a minimum transition probability, which operates independently of the main regret-free algorithm.</description>

      <title>On the Efficiency of ERM in Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a collection of feature maps indexed by a set $\mathcal{T}$, we study the performance of empirical risk minimization (ERM) on regression problems with square loss over the union of the linear classes induced by these feature maps. This setup aims at capturing the simplest instance of feature learning, where the model is expected to jointly learn from the data an appropriate feature map and a linear predictor. We start by studying the asymptotic quantiles of the excess risk of sequences of empirical risk minimizers. Remarkably, we show that when the set $\mathcal{T}$ is not too large and when there is a unique optimal feature map, these quantiles coincide, up to a factor of two, with those of the excess risk of the oracle procedure, which knows a priori this optimal feature map and deterministically outputs an empirical risk minimizer from the associated optimal linear class. We complement this asymptotic result with a non-asymptotic analysis that quantifies the decaying effect of the global complexity of the set $\mathcal{T}$ on the excess risk of ERM, and relates it to the size of the sublevel sets of the suboptimality of the feature maps. As an application of our results, we obtain new guarantees on the performance of the best subset selection procedure in sparse linear regression under general assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here is the revised abstract, ensuring all characters are ASCII-compatible:
  In this work, we introduce a new framework for active experimentation, the Prediction-Guided Active Experiment (PGAE), which leverages predictions from an existing machine learning model to guide sampling and experimentation. Specifically, at each time step, an experimental unit is sampled according to a designated sampling distribution, and the actual outcome is observed based on an experimental probability. Otherwise, only a prediction for the outcome is available. We begin by analyzing the non-adaptive case, where full information on the joint distribution of the predictor and the actual outcome is assumed. For this scenario, we derive an optimal experimentation strategy by minimizing the semi-parametric efficiency bound for the class of regular estimators. We then introduce an estimator that meets this efficiency bound, achieving asymptotic optimality. Next, we move to the adaptive case, where the predictor is continuously updated with newly sampled data. We show that the adaptive version of the estimator remains efficient and attains the same semi-parametric bound under certain regularity assumptions. Finally, we validate PGAE's performance through simulations and a semi-synthetic experiment using data from the US Census Bureau. The results underscore the PGAE framework's effectiveness and superiority compared to other existing methods.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking pre-trained text embedding models in aligning built asset information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate mapping of the built asset information to established data classification systems and taxonomies is crucial for effective asset management, whether for compliance at project handover or ad-hoc data integration scenarios. Due to the complex nature of built asset data, which predominantly comprises technical text elements, this process remains largely manual and reliant on domain expert input. Recent breakthroughs in contextual text representation learning (text embedding), particularly through pre-trained large language models, offer promising approaches that can facilitate the automation of cross-mapping of the built asset data. However, no comprehensive evaluation has yet been conducted to assess these models' ability to effectively represent the complex semantics specific to built asset technical terminology. This study presents a comparative benchmark of state-of-the-art text embedding models to evaluate their effectiveness in aligning built asset information with domain-specific technical concepts. Our proposed datasets are derived from two renowned built asset data classification dictionaries. The results of our benchmarking across six proposed datasets, covering three tasks of clustering, retrieval, and reranking, highlight the need for future research on domain adaptation techniques. The benchmarking resources are published as an open-source library, which will be maintained and extended to support future evaluations in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE) and neural likelihood estimation (NLE) are machine learning approaches that provide accurate posterior, and likelihood, approximations in complex modeling scenarios, and in situations where conducting amortized inference is a necessity. While such methods have shown significant promise across a range of diverse scientific applications, the statistical accuracy of these methods is so far unexplored. In this manuscript, we give, for the first time, an in-depth exploration on the statistical behavior of NPE and NLE. We prove that these methods have similar theoretical guarantees to common statistical methods like approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL). While NPE and NLE methods are just as accurate as ABC and BSL, we prove that this accuracy can often be achieved at a vastly reduced computational cost, and will therefore deliver more attractive approximations than ABC and BSL in certain problems. We verify our results theoretically and in several examples from the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning architectures based on convolutional neural networks tend to rely on continuous, smooth features. While this characteristics provides significant robustness and proves useful in many real-world tasks, it is strikingly incompatible with the physical characteristic of the world, which, at the scale in which humans operate, comprises crisp objects, typically representing well-defined categories. This study proposes a class of neurosymbolic systems that learn by reconstructing the observed images in terms of visual primitives and are thus forced to form high-level, structural explanations of them. When applied to the task of diagnosing abnormalities in histological imaging, the method proved superior to a conventional deep learning architecture in terms of classification accuracy, while being more transparent.</description>

However, most existing T2I diffusion models are trained with a resolution limit of 512x512, making scaling beyond this resolution an unresolved but necessary challenge for image SR. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that, for the first time, enables these models to generate 2K, 4K, and even 8K images without any additional training. Our method leverages MultiDiffusion, which distributes the generation across multiple diffusion paths to ensure global coherence at larger scales, and local degradation-aware prompt extraction, which guides the T2I model to reconstruct fine local structures according to its low-resolution input. These innovations unlock higher resolutions, allowing T2I diffusion models to be applied to image SR tasks without limitation on resolution.</description>

      <title>Just Leaf It: Accelerating Diffusion Classifiers with Hierarchical Class Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models, known for their generative capabilities, have recently shown unexpected potential in image classification tasks by using Bayes' theorem. However, most diffusion classifiers require evaluating all class labels for a single classification, leading to significant computational costs that can hinder their application in large-scale scenarios. To address this, we present a Hierarchical Diffusion Classifier (HDC) that exploits the inherent hierarchical label structure of a dataset. By progressively pruning irrelevant high-level categories and refining predictions only within relevant subcategories, i.e., leaf nodes, HDC reduces the total number of class evaluations. As a result, HDC can accelerate inference by up to 60% while maintaining and, in some cases, improving classification accuracy. Our work enables a new control mechanism of the trade-off between speed and precision, making diffusion-based classification more viable for real-world applications, particularly in large-scale image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Gender Bias in Contextual Word Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Word embeddings have been shown to produce remarkable results in tackling a vast majority of NLP related tasks. Unfortunately, word embeddings also capture the stereotypical biases that are prevalent in society, affecting the predictive performance of the embeddings when used in downstream tasks. While various techniques have been proposed \cite{bolukbasi2016man, zhao2018learning} and criticized\cite{gonen2019lipstick} for static embeddings, very little work has focused on mitigating bias in contextual embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel objective function for MLM(Masked-Language Modeling) which largely mitigates the gender bias in contextual embeddings and also preserves the performance for downstream tasks. Since previous works on measuring bias in contextual embeddings lack in normative reasoning, we also propose novel evaluation metrics that are straight-forward and aligned with our motivations in debiasing. We also propose new methods for debiasing static embeddings and provide empirical proof via extensive analysis and experiments, as to why the main source of bias in static embeddings stems from the presence of stereotypical names rather than gendered words themselves. All experiments and embeddings studied are in English, unless otherwise specified.\citep{bender2011achieving}.</description>

      <title>Does Unlearning Truly Unlearn? A Black Box Evaluation of LLM Unlearning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model unlearning aims to remove harmful information that LLMs have learnt to prevent their use for malicious purposes. LLMU and RMU have been proposed as two methods for LLM unlearning, achieving impressive results on unlearning benchmarks. We study in detail the efficacy of these methods by evaluating their impact on general model capabilities on the WMDP benchmark as well as a biology benchmark we create. Our experiments show that RMU generally leads to better preservation of model capabilities, for similar or better unlearning. We further test the robustness of these methods and find that doing 5-shot prompting or rephrasing the question in simple ways can lead to an over ten-fold increase in accuracy on unlearning benchmarks. Finally, we show that training on unrelated data can almost completely recover pre-unlearning performance, demonstrating that these methods fail at truly unlearning.

      <title>Distill the Best, Ignore the Rest: Improving Dataset Distillation with Loss-Value-Based Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation has gained significant interest in recent years, yet existing approaches typically distill from the entire dataset, potentially including non-beneficial samples. We introduce a novel "Prune First, Distill After" framework that systematically prunes datasets via loss-based sampling prior to distillation. By leveraging pruning before classical distillation techniques and generative priors, we create a representative core-set that leads to enhanced generalization for unseen architectures - a significant challenge of current distillation methods. More specifically, our proposed framework significantly boosts distilled quality, achieving up to a 5.2 percentage points accuracy increase even with substantial dataset pruning, i.e., removing 80% of the original dataset prior to distillation. Overall, our experimental results highlight the advantages of our easy-sample prioritization and cross-architecture robustness, paving the way for more effective and high-quality dataset distillation.</description>

      <title>Exact Risk Curves of signSGD in High-Dimensions: Quantifying Preconditioning and Noise-Compression Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, signSGD has garnered interest as both a practical optimizer as well as a simple model to understand adaptive optimizers like Adam. Though there is a general consensus that signSGD acts to precondition optimization and reshapes noise, quantitatively understanding these effects in theoretically solvable settings remains difficult. We present an analysis of signSGD in a high dimensional limit, and derive a limiting SDE and ODE to describe the risk. Using this framework we quantify four effects of signSGD: effective learning rate, noise compression, diagonal preconditioning, and gradient noise reshaping. Our analysis is consistent with experimental observations but moves beyond that by quantifying the dependence of these effects on the data and noise distributions. We conclude with a conjecture on how these results might be extended to Adam.</description>

      <title>A Computational Method for Measuring "Open Codes" in Qualitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qualitative analysis is critical to understanding human datasets in many social science disciplines. Open coding is an inductive qualitative process that identifies and interprets "open codes" from datasets. Yet, meeting methodological expectations (such as "as exhaustive as possible") can be challenging. While many machine learning (ML)/generative AI (GAI) studies have attempted to support open coding, few have systematically measured or evaluated GAI outcomes, increasing potential bias risks. Building on Grounded Theory and Thematic Analysis theories, we present a computational method to measure and identify potential biases from "open codes" systematically. Instead of operationalizing human expert results as the "ground truth," our method is built upon a team-based approach between human and machine coders. We experiment with two HCI datasets to establish this method's reliability by 1) comparing it with human analysis, and 2) analyzing its output stability. We present evidence-based suggestions and example workflows for ML/GAI to support open coding.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised denoising of visual field data improves detection of glaucoma progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perimetric measurements provide insight into a patient's peripheral vision and day-to-day functioning and are the main outcome measure for identifying progression of visual damage from glaucoma. However, visual field data can be noisy, exhibiting high variance, especially with increasing damage. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of self-supervised deep learning in denoising visual field data from over 4000 patients to enhance its signal-to-noise ratio and its ability to detect true glaucoma progression. We deployed both a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a masked autoencoder to determine which self-supervised model best smooths the visual field data while reconstructing salient features that are less noisy and more predictive of worsening disease. Our results indicate that including a categorical p-value at every visual field location improves the smoothing of visual field data. Masked autoencoders led to cleaner denoised data than previous methods, such as variational autoencoders. A 4.7% increase in detection of progressing eyes with pointwise linear regression (PLR) was observed. The masked and variational autoencoders' smoothed data predicted glaucoma progression 2.3 months earlier when p-values were included compared to when they were not. The faster prediction of time to progression (TTP) and the higher percentage progression detected support our hypothesis that masking out visual field elements during training while including p-values at each location would improve the task of detection of visual field progression. Our study has clinically relevant implications regarding masking when training neural networks to denoise visual field data, resulting in earlier and more accurate detection of glaucoma progression. This denoising model can be integrated into future models for visual field analysis to enhance detection of glaucoma progression.</description>

      <title>HEIGHT: Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer for Robot Navigation in Crowded and Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robot navigation in dense and interactive crowds with environmental constraints such as corridors and furniture. Previous methods fail to consider all types of interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different components in the environment and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal (st) graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous st-graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions among entities through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success and efficiency in challenging navigation scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our pipeline achieves better zero-shot generalization capability than previous works when the densities of humans and obstacles change.

      <title>Tangential Randomization in Linear Bandits (TRAiL): Guaranteed Inference and Regret Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze TRAiL (Tangential Randomization in Linear Bandits), a computationally efficient regret-optimal forced exploration algorithm for linear bandits on action sets that are sublevel sets of strongly convex functions. TRAiL estimates the governing parameter of the linear bandit problem through a standard regularized least squares and perturbs the reward-maximizing action corresponding to said point estimate along the tangent plane of the convex compact action set before projecting back to it. Exploiting concentration results for matrix martingales, we prove that TRAiL ensures a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ growth in the inference quality, measured via the minimum eigenvalue of the design (regressor) matrix with high-probability over a $T$-length period. We build on this result to obtain an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$ upper bound on cumulative regret with probability at least $ 1 - 1/T$ over $T$ periods, and compare TRAiL to other popular algorithms for linear bandits. Then, we characterize an $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ minimax lower bound for any algorithm on the expected regret that covers a wide variety of action/parameter sets and noise processes. Our analysis not only expands the realm of lower-bounds in linear bandits significantly, but as a byproduct, yields a trade-off between regret and inference quality. Specifically, we prove that any algorithm with an $\mathcal{O}(T^\alpha)$ expected regret growth must have an $\Omega(T^{1-\alpha})$ asymptotic growth in expected inference quality. Our experiments on the $L^p$ unit ball as action sets reveal how this relation can be violated, but only in the short-run, before returning to respect the bound asymptotically. In effect, regret-minimizing algorithms must have just the right rate of inference -- too fast or too slow inference will incur sub-optimal regret growth.</description>

      <title>Sensor-fusion based Prognostics Framework for Complex Engineering Systems Exhibiting Multiple Failure Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex engineering systems are often subject to multiple failure modes. Developing a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction model that does not consider the failure mode causing degradation is likely to result in inaccurate predictions. However, distinguishing between causes of failure without manually inspecting the system is nontrivial. This challenge is increased when the causes of historically observed failures are unknown. Sensors, which are useful for monitoring the state-of-health of systems, can also be used for distinguishing between multiple failure modes as the presence of multiple failure modes results in discriminatory behavior of the sensor signals. When systems are equipped with multiple sensors, some sensors may exhibit behavior correlated with degradation, while other sensors do not. Furthermore, which sensors exhibit this behavior may differ for each failure mode. In this paper, we present a simultaneous clustering and sensor selection approach for unlabeled training datasets of systems exhibiting multiple failure modes. The cluster assignments and the selected sensors are then utilized in real-time to first diagnose the active failure mode and then to predict the system RUL. We validate the complete pipeline of the methodology using a simulated dataset of systems exhibiting two failure modes and on a turbofan degradation dataset from NASA.</description>

      <title>Action-Attentive Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Alignment of Beamlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchrotron radiation sources play a crucial role in fields such as materials science, biology, and chemistry. The beamline, a key subsystem of the synchrotron, modulates and directs the radiation to the sample for analysis. However, the alignment of beamlines is a complex and time-consuming process, primarily carried out manually by experienced engineers. Even minor misalignments in optical components can significantly affect the beam's properties, leading to suboptimal experimental outcomes. Current automated methods, such as bayesian optimization (BO) and reinforcement learning (RL), although these methods enhance performance, limitations remain. The relationship between the current and target beam properties, crucial for determining the adjustment, is not fully considered. Additionally, the physical characteristics of optical elements are overlooked, such as the need to adjust specific devices to control the output beam's spot size or position. This paper addresses the alignment of beamlines by modeling it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and training an intelligent agent using RL. The agent calculates adjustment values based on the current and target beam states, executes actions, and iterates until optimal parameters are achieved. A policy network with action attention is designed to improve decision-making by considering both state differences and the impact of optical components. Experiments on two simulated beamlines demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods, with ablation studies highlighting the effectiveness of the action attention-based policy network.</description>

      <title>Testability of Instrumental Variables in Additive Nonlinear, Non-Constant Effects Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the issue of the testability of instrumental variables derived from observational data. Most existing testable implications are centered on scenarios where the treatment is a discrete variable, e.g., instrumental inequality (Pearl, 1995), or where the effect is assumed to be constant, e.g., instrumental variables condition based on the principle of independent mechanisms (Burauel, 2023). However, treatments can often be continuous variables, such as drug dosages or nutritional content levels, and non-constant effects may occur in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider an additive nonlinear, non-constant effects model with unmeasured confounders, in which treatments can be either discrete or continuous, and propose an Auxiliary-based Independence Test (AIT) condition to test whether a variable is a valid instrument. We first show that if the candidate instrument is valid, then the AIT condition holds. Moreover, we illustrate the implications of the AIT condition and demonstrate that, in certain conditions, AIT conditions are necessary and sufficient to detect all invalid IVs. We also extend the AIT condition to include covariates and introduce a practical testing algorithm. Experimental results on both synthetic and three different real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a noise schedule that ensures a constant rate of change in the probability distribution of diffused data throughout the diffusion process. To obtain this noise schedule, we measure the rate of change in the probability distribution of the forward process and use it to determine the noise schedule before training diffusion models. The functional form of the noise schedule is automatically determined and tailored to each dataset and type of diffusion model. We evaluate the effectiveness of our noise schedule on unconditional and class-conditional image generation tasks using the LSUN (bedroom/church/cat/horse), ImageNet, and FFHQ datasets. Through extensive experiments, we confirmed that our noise schedule broadly improves the performance of the diffusion models regardless of the dataset, sampler, number of function evaluations, or type of diffusion model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</description>

      <title>Predicting User Intents and Musical Attributes from Music Discovery Conversations</title>

Abstract: Intent classification is a text understanding task that identifies user needs from input text queries. While intent classification has been extensively studied in various domains, it has not received much attention in the music domain. In this paper, we investigate intent classification models for music discovery conversation, focusing on pre-trained language models. Rather than only predicting functional needs: intent classification, we also include a task for classifying musical needs: musical attribute classification. Additionally, we propose a method of concatenating previous chat history with just single-turn user queries in the input text, allowing the model to understand the overall conversation context better. Our proposed model significantly improves the F1 score for both user intent and musical attribute classification, and surpasses the zero-shot and few-shot performance of the pretrained Llama 3 model.</description>

      <title>Error-Feedback Model for Output Correction in Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, imitation learning using neural networks has enabled robots to perform flexible tasks. However, since neural networks operate in a feedforward structure, they do not possess a mechanism to compensate for output errors. To address this limitation, we developed a feedback mechanism to correct these errors. By employing a hierarchical structure for neural networks comprising lower and upper layers, the lower layer was controlled to follow the upper layer. Additionally, using a multi-layer perceptron in the lower layer, which lacks an internal state, enhanced the error feedback. In the character-writing task, this model demonstrated improved accuracy in writing previously untrained characters. In the character-writing task, this model demonstrated improved accuracy in writing previously untrained characters. Through autonomous control with error feedback, we confirmed that the lower layer could effectively track the output of the upper layer. This study represents a promising step toward integrating neural networks with control theories.</description>

      <title>Restructuring Tractable Probabilistic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) is a unifying representation for probabilistic models that support tractable inference. Numerous applications of PCs like controllable text generation depend on the ability to efficiently multiply two circuits. Existing multiplication algorithms require that the circuits respect the same structure, i.e. variable scopes decomposes according to the same vtree. In this work, we propose and study the task of restructuring structured(-decomposable) PCs, that is, transforming a structured PC such that it conforms to a target vtree. We propose a generic approach for this problem and show that it leads to novel polynomial-time algorithms for multiplying circuits respecting different vtrees, as well as a practical depth-reduction algorithm that preserves structured decomposibility. Our work opens up new avenues for tractable PC inference, suggesting the possibility of training with less restrictive PC structures while enabling efficient inference by changing their structures at inference time.</description>

      <title>On the Accuracy and Precision of Moving Averages to Estimate Wi-Fi Link Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radio spectrum is characterized by a noticeable variability, which impairs performance and determinism of every wireless communication technology. To counteract this aspect, mechanisms like Minstrel are customarily employed in real Wi-Fi devices, and the adoption of machine learning for optimization is envisaged in next-generation Wi-Fi 8. All these approaches require communication quality to be monitored at runtime.
  In this paper, the effectiveness of simple techniques based on moving averages to estimate wireless link quality is analyzed, to assess their advantages and weaknesses. Results can be used, e.g., as a baseline when studying how artificial intelligence can be employed to mitigate unpredictability of wireless networks by providing reliable estimates about current spectrum conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of world models and active exploration as emergent properties of open-ended behavior optimization in autonomous agents. In discussing the source of the open-endedness of living things, we start from the perspective of biological systems as understood by the mechanistic approach of theoretical biology and artificial life. From this perspective, we discuss the potential of homeostasis in particular as an open-ended objective for autonomous agents and as a general, integrative extrinsic motivation. We then discuss the possibility of implicitly acquiring a world model and active exploration through the internal dynamics of a network, and a hypothetical architecture for this, by combining meta-reinforcement learning, which assumes domain adaptation as a system that achieves robust homeostasis.</description>

      <title>SNN-Based Online Learning of Concepts and Action Laws in an Open World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the architecture of a fully autonomous, bio-inspired cognitive agent built around a spiking neural network (SNN) implementing the agent's semantic memory. The agent explores its universe and learns concepts of objects/situations and of its own actions in a one-shot manner. While object/situation concepts are unary, action concepts are triples made up of an initial situation, a motor activity, and an outcome. They embody the agent's knowledge of its universe's actions laws. Both kinds of concepts have different degrees of generality. To make decisions the agent queries its semantic memory for the expected outcomes of envisaged actions and chooses the action to take on the basis of these predictions. Our experiments show that the agent handles new situations by appealing to previously learned general concepts and rapidly modifies its concepts to adapt to environment changes.</description>

      <title>Perfecting Imperfect Physical Neural Networks with Transferable Robustness using Sharpness-Aware Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI models are essential in science and engineering, but recent advances are pushing the limits of traditional digital hardware. To address these limitations, physical neural networks (PNNs), which use physical substrates for computation, have gained increasing attention. However, developing effective training methods for PNNs remains a significant challenge. Current approaches, regardless of offline and online training, suffer from significant accuracy loss. Offline training is hindered by imprecise modeling, while online training yields device-specific models that can't be transferred to other devices due to manufacturing variances. Both methods face challenges from perturbations after deployment, such as thermal drift or alignment errors, which make trained models invalid and require retraining. Here, we address the challenges with both offline and online training through a novel technique called Sharpness-Aware Training (SAT), where we innovatively leverage the geometry of the loss landscape to tackle the problems in training physical systems. SAT enables accurate training using efficient backpropagation algorithms, even with imprecise models. PNNs trained by SAT offline even outperform those trained online, despite modeling and fabrication errors. SAT also overcomes online training limitations by enabling reliable transfer of models between devices. Finally, SAT is highly resilient to perturbations after deployment, allowing PNNs to continuously operate accurately under perturbations without retraining. We demonstrate SAT across three types of PNNs, showing it is universally applicable, regardless of whether the models are explicitly known. This work offers a transformative, efficient approach to training PNNs, addressing critical challenges in analog computing and enabling real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>RedPajama: an Open Dataset for Training Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly becoming a cornerstone technology in artificial intelligence, the sciences, and society as a whole, yet the optimal strategies for dataset composition and filtering remain largely elusive. Many of the top-performing models lack transparency in their dataset curation and model development processes, posing an obstacle to the development of fully open language models. In this paper, we identify three core data-related challenges that must be addressed to advance open-source language models. These include (1) transparency in model development, including the data curation process, (2) access to large quantities of high-quality data, and (3) availability of artifacts and metadata for dataset curation and analysis. To address these challenges, we release RedPajama-V1, an open reproduction of the LLaMA training dataset. In addition, we release RedPajama-V2, a massive web-only dataset consisting of raw, unfiltered text data together with quality signals and metadata. Together, the RedPajama datasets comprise over 100 trillion tokens spanning multiple domains and with their quality signals facilitate the filtering of data, aiming to inspire the development of numerous new datasets. To date, these datasets have already been used in the training of strong language models used in production, such as Snowflake Arctic, Salesforce's XGen and AI2's OLMo. To provide insight into the quality of RedPajama, we present a series of analyses and ablation studies with decoder-only language models with up to 1.6B parameters. Our findings demonstrate how quality signals for web data can be effectively leveraged to curate high-quality subsets of the dataset, underscoring the potential of RedPajama to advance the development of transparent and high-performing language models at scale.</description>

      <title>STRisk: A Socio-Technical Approach to Assess Hacking Breaches Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data breaches have begun to take on new dimensions and their prediction is becoming of great importance to organizations. Prior work has addressed this issue mainly from a technical perspective and neglected other interfering aspects such as the social media dimension. To fill this gap, we propose STRisk which is a predictive system where we expand the scope of the prediction task by bringing into play the social media dimension. We study over 3800 US organizations including both victim and non-victim organizations. For each organization, we design a profile composed of a variety of externally measured technical indicators and social factors. In addition, to account for unreported incidents, we consider the non-victim sample to be noisy and propose a noise correction approach to correct mislabeled organizations. We then build several machine learning models to predict whether an organization is exposed to experience a hacking breach. By exploiting both technical and social features, we achieve a Area Under Curve (AUC) score exceeding 98%, which is 12% higher than the AUC achieved using only technical features. Furthermore, our feature importance analysis reveals that open ports and expired certificates are the best technical predictors, while spreadability and agreeability are the best social predictors.</description>

      <title>Dimension Reduction via Sum-of-Squares and Improved Clustering Algorithms for Non-Spherical Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach for clustering non-spherical (i.e., arbitrary component covariances) Gaussian mixture models via a subroutine, based on the sum-of-squares method, that finds a low-dimensional separation-preserving projection of the input data. Our method gives a non-spherical analog of the classical dimension reduction, based on singular value decomposition, that forms a key component of the celebrated spherical clustering algorithm of Vempala and Wang [VW04] (in addition to several other applications).
  As applications, we obtain an algorithm to (1) cluster an arbitrary total-variation separated mixture of $k$ centered (i.e., zero-mean) Gaussians with $n\geq \operatorname{poly}(d) f(w_{\min}^{-1})$ samples and $\operatorname{poly}(n)$ time, and (2) cluster an arbitrary total-variation separated mixture of $k$ Gaussians with identical but arbitrary unknown covariance with $n \geq d^{O(\log w_{\min}^{-1})} f(w_{\min}^{-1})$ samples and $n^{O(\log w_{\min}^{-1})}$ time. Here, $w_{\min}$ is the minimum mixing weight of the input mixture, and $f$ does not depend on the dimension $d$. Our algorithms naturally extend to tolerating a dimension-independent fraction of arbitrary outliers. Before this work, the techniques in the state-of-the-art non-spherical clustering algorithms needed $d^{O(k)} f(w_{\min}^{-1})$ time and samples for clustering such mixtures.
  Our results may come as a surprise in the context of the $d^{\Omega(k)}$ statistical query lower bound [DKS17] for clustering non-spherical Gaussian mixtures. While this result is usually thought to rule out $d^{o(k)}$ cost algorithms for the problem, our results show that the lower bounds can in fact be circumvented for a remarkably general class of Gaussian mixtures.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.</description>

      <title>MAViS: Modular Autonomous Virtualization System for Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Quantum Dot Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a Modular Automated Virtualization System (MAViS) -- a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multi-layer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>S3TU-Net: Structured Convolution and Superpixel Transformer for Lung Nodule Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The irregular and challenging characteristics of lung adenocarcinoma nodules in computed tomography (CT) images complicate staging diagnosis, making accurate segmentation critical for clinicians to extract detailed lesion information. In this study, we propose a segmentation model, S3TU-Net, which integrates multi-dimensional spatial connectors and a superpixel-based visual transformer. S3TU-Net is built on a multi-view CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture, incorporating superpixel algorithms, structured weighting, and spatial shifting techniques to achieve superior segmentation performance. The model leverages structured convolution blocks (DWF-Conv/D2BR-Conv) to extract multi-scale local features while mitigating overfitting. To enhance multi-scale feature fusion, we introduce the S2-MLP Link, integrating spatial shifting and attention mechanisms at the skip connections. Additionally, the residual-based superpixel visual transformer (RM-SViT) effectively merges global and local features by employing sparse correlation learning and multi-branch attention to capture long-range dependencies, with residual connections enhancing stability and computational efficiency. Experimental results on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate that S3TU-Net achieves a DSC, precision, and IoU of 89.04%, 90.73%, and 90.70%, respectively. Compared to recent methods, S3TU-Net improves DSC by 4.52% and sensitivity by 3.16%, with other metrics showing an approximate 2% increase. In addition to comparison and ablation studies, we validated the generalization ability of our model on the EPDB private dataset, achieving a DSC of 86.40%.</description>

      <title>Stream-Based Active Learning for Process Monitoring</title>

Abstract: Statistical process monitoring (SPM) methods are essential tools in quality management to check the stability of industrial processes, i.e., to dynamically classify the process state as in control (IC), under normal operating conditions, or out of control (OC), otherwise. Traditional SPM methods are based on unsupervised approaches, which are popular because in most industrial applications the true OC states of the process are not explicitly known. This hampered the development of supervised methods that could instead take advantage of process data containing labels on the true process state, although they still need improvement in dealing with class imbalance, as OC states are rare in high-quality processes, and the dynamic recognition of unseen classes, e.g., the number of possible OC states. This article presents a novel stream-based active learning strategy for SPM that enhances partially hidden Markov models to deal with data streams. The ultimate goal is to optimize labeling resources constrained by a limited budget and dynamically update the possible OC states. The proposed method performance in classifying the true state of the process is assessed through a simulation and a case study on the SPM of a resistance spot welding process in the automotive industry, which motivated this research.</description>

      <title>A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</description>

      <title>Procedural Knowledge in Pretraining Drives Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models have been sketched out in great detail in recent years, providing an intriguing yet conflicting picture. On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems. On the other hand, they show surprising reasoning gaps when compared to humans, casting doubt on the robustness of their generalisation strategies. The sheer volume of data used in the design of LLMs has precluded us from applying the method traditionally used to measure generalisation: train-test set separation. To overcome this, we study what kind of generalisation strategies LLMs employ when performing reasoning tasks by investigating the pretraining data they rely on. For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their pretraining tokens, we identify what documents influence the model outputs for three simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that are influential for answering factual questions. We find that, while the models rely on mostly distinct sets of data for each factual question, a document often has a similar influence across different reasoning questions within the same task, indicating the presence of procedural knowledge. We further find that the answers to factual questions often show up in the most influential data. However, for reasoning questions the answers usually do not show up as highly influential, nor do the answers to the intermediate reasoning steps. When we characterise the top ranked documents for the reasoning questions qualitatively, we confirm that the influential documents often contain procedural knowledge, like demonstrating how to obtain a solution using formulae or code. Our findings indicate that the approach to reasoning the models use is unlike retrieval, and more like a generalisable strategy that synthesises procedural knowledge from documents doing a similar form of reasoning.</description>

      <title>ULTra: Unveiling Latent Token Interpretability in Transformer Based Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) through self-attention mechanisms. However, due to their complexity, their latent token representations are often difficult to interpret. We introduce a novel framework that interprets Transformer embeddings, uncovering meaningful semantic patterns within them. Based on this framework, we demonstrate that zero-shot unsupervised semantic segmentation can be performed effectively without any fine-tuning using a model pre-trained for tasks other than segmentation. Our method reveals the inherent capacity of Transformer models for understanding input semantics and achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation, outperforming traditional segmentation models. Specifically, our approach achieves an accuracy of 67.2 % and an mIoU of 32.9 % on the COCO-Stuff dataset, as well as an mIoU of 51.9 % on the PASCAL VOC dataset. Additionally, we validate our interpretability framework on LLMs for text summarization, demonstrating its broad applicability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Debias your Large Multi-Modal Model at Test-Time with Non-Contrastive Visual Attribute Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as general-purpose chatbots that can engage in conversations about a provided input, such as an image. However, their responses are influenced by societal biases present in their training datasets, leading to undesirable differences in how the model responds when presented with images depicting people of different demographics. In this work, we propose a novel debiasing framework for LMMs that directly removes biased representations during text generation to decrease outputs related to protected attributes, or even representing them internally. Our proposed method is training-free; given a single image and a list of target attributes, we can ablate the corresponding representations with just one step of gradient descent on the image itself. Our experiments show that not only can we can minimize the propensity of LMMs to generate text related to protected attributes, but we can improve sentiment and even simply use synthetic data to inform the ablation while retaining language modeling capabilities on real data such as COCO or FACET. Furthermore, we find the resulting generations from a debiased LMM exhibit similar accuracy as a baseline biased model, showing that debiasing effects can be achieved without sacrificing model performance.</description>

      <title>GNNAS-Dock: Budget Aware Algorithm Selection with Graph Neural Networks for Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a major element in drug discovery and design. It enables the prediction of ligand-protein interactions by simulating the binding of small molecules to proteins. Despite the availability of numerous docking algorithms, there is no single algorithm consistently outperforms the others across a diverse set of docking scenarios. This paper introduces GNNAS-Dock, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based automated algorithm selection system for molecular docking in blind docking situations. GNNs are accommodated to process the complex structural data of both ligands and proteins. They benefit from the inherent graph-like properties to predict the performance of various docking algorithms under different conditions. The present study pursues two main objectives: 1) predict the performance of each candidate docking algorithm, in terms of Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), thereby identifying the most accurate method for specific scenarios; and 2) choose the best computationally efficient docking algorithm for each docking case, aiming to reduce the time required for docking while maintaining high accuracy. We validate our approach on PDBBind 2020 refined set, which contains about 5,300 pairs of protein-ligand complexes.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph $p$-Laplacian equations for data interpolation and semi-supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraph learning with $p$-Laplacian regularization has attracted a lot of attention due to its flexibility in modeling higher-order relationships in data. This paper focuses on its fast numerical implementation, which is challenging due to the non-differentiability of the objective function and the non-uniqueness of the minimizer. We derive a hypergraph $p$-Laplacian equation from the subdifferential of the $p$-Laplacian regularization. A simplified equation that is mathematically well-posed and computationally efficient is proposed as an alternative. Numerical experiments verify that the simplified $p$-Laplacian equation suppresses spiky solutions in data interpolation and improves classification accuracy in semi-supervised learning. The remarkably low computational cost enables further applications.</description>

      <title>STREAM: A Universal State-Space Model for Sparse Geometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handling sparse and unstructured geometric data, such as point clouds or event-based vision, is a pressing challenge in the field of machine vision. Recently, sequence models such as Transformers and state-space models entered the domain of geometric data. These methods require specialized preprocessing to create a sequential view of a set of points. Furthermore, prior works involving sequence models iterate geometric data with either uniform or learned step sizes, implicitly relying on the model to infer the underlying geometric structure. In this work, we propose to encode geometric structure explicitly into the parameterization of a state-space model. State-space models are based on linear dynamics governed by a one-dimensional variable such as time or a spatial coordinate. We exploit this dynamic variable to inject relative differences of coordinates into the step size of the state-space model. The resulting geometric operation computes interactions between all pairs of N points in O(N) steps. Our model deploys the Mamba selective state-space model with a modified CUDA kernel to efficiently map sparse geometric data to modern hardware. The resulting sequence model, which we call STREAM, achieves competitive results on a range of benchmarks from point-cloud classification to event-based vision and audio classification. STREAM demonstrates a powerful inductive bias for sparse geometric data by improving the PointMamba baseline when trained from scratch on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN point cloud analysis datasets. It further achieves, for the first time, 100% test accuracy on all 11 classes of the DVS128 Gestures dataset.</description>

      <title>Reward driven workflows for unsupervised explainable analysis of phases and ferroic variants from atomically resolved imaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in aberration corrected electron microscopy necessitates development of robust methods for the identification of phases, ferroic variants, and other pertinent aspects of materials structure from imaging data. While unsupervised methods for clustering and classification are widely used for these tasks, their performance can be sensitive to hyperparameter selection in the analysis workflow. In this study, we explore the effects of descriptors and hyperparameters on the capability of unsupervised ML methods to distill local structural information, exemplified by discovery of polarization and lattice distortion in Sm doped BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films. We demonstrate that a reward-driven approach can be used to optimize these key hyperparameters across the full workflow, where rewards were designed to reflect domain wall continuity and straightness, ensuring that the analysis aligns with the material's physical behavior. This approach allows us to discover local descriptors that are best aligned with the specific physical behavior, providing insight into the fundamental physics of materials. We further extend the reward driven workflows to disentangle structural factors of variation via optimized variational autoencoder (VAE). Finally, the importance of well-defined rewards was explored as a quantifiable measure of success of the workflow.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Approach Combining Structural and Cross-domain Textual Guidance for Weakly Supervised OCT Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases. However, the labor-intensive nature of pixel-level annotation limits the scalability of supervised learning with large datasets. Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) provides a promising alternative by leveraging image-level labels. In this study, we propose a novel WSSS approach that integrates structural guidance with text-driven strategies to generate high-quality pseudo labels, significantly improving segmentation performance. In terms of visual information, our method employs two processing modules that exchange raw image features and structural features from OCT images, guiding the model to identify where lesions are likely to occur. In terms of textual information, we utilize large-scale pretrained models from cross-domain sources to implement label-informed textual guidance and synthetic descriptive integration with two textual processing modules that combine local semantic features with consistent synthetic descriptions. By fusing these visual and textual components within a multimodal framework, our approach enhances lesion localization accuracy. Experimental results on three OCT datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in medical imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the impressive capabilities of in-context learning with large transformers, In-Context Imitation Learning (ICIL) is a promising opportunity for robotics. We introduce Instant Policy, which learns new tasks instantly (without further training) from just one or two demonstrations, achieving ICIL through two key components. First, we introduce inductive biases through a graph representation and model ICIL as a graph generation problem with a learned diffusion process, enabling structured reasoning over demonstrations, observations, and actions. Second, we show that such a model can be trained using pseudo-demonstrations - arbitrary trajectories generated in simulation - as a virtually infinite pool of training data. Simulated and real experiments show that Instant Policy enables rapid learning of various everyday robot tasks. We also show how it can serve as a foundation for cross-embodiment and zero-shot transfer to language-defined tasks. Code and videos are available at https://www.robot-learning.uk/instant-policy.</description>

      <title>Leadsee-Precip: A Deep Learning Diagnostic Model for Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep-learning weather forecasting models have surpassed traditional numerical models in terms of the accuracy of meteorological variables. However, there is considerable potential for improvements in precipitation forecasts, especially for heavy precipitation events. To address this deficiency, we propose Leadsee-Precip, a global deep learning model to generate precipitation from meteorological circulation fields. The model utilizes an information balance scheme to tackle the challenges of predicting heavy precipitation caused by the long-tail distribution of precipitation data. Additionally, more accurate satellite and radar-based precipitation retrievals are used as training targets. Compared to artificial intelligence global weather models, the heavy precipitation from Leadsee-Precip is more consistent with observations and shows competitive performance against global numerical weather prediction models. Leadsee-Precip can be integrated with any global circulation model to generate precipitation forecasts. But the deviations between the predicted and the ground-truth circulation fields may lead to a weakened precipitation forecast, which could potentially be mitigated by further fine-tuning based on the predicted circulation fields.</description>

      <title>PoM: Efficient Image and Video Generation with the Polynomial Mixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models based on Multi-Head Attention (MHA) have become ubiquitous to generate high quality images and videos. However, encoding an image or a video as a sequence of patches results in costly attention patterns, as the requirements both in terms of memory and compute grow quadratically. To alleviate this problem, we propose a drop-in replacement for MHA called the Polynomial Mixer (PoM) that has the benefit of encoding the entire sequence into an explicit state. PoM has a linear complexity with respect to the number of tokens. This explicit state also allows us to generate frames in a sequential fashion, minimizing memory and compute requirement, while still being able to train in parallel. We show the Polynomial Mixer is a universal sequence-to-sequence approximator, just like regular MHA. We adapt several Diffusion Transformers (DiT) for generating images and videos with PoM replacing MHA, and we obtain high quality samples while using less computational resources. The code is available at https://github.com/davidpicard/HoMM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes the IoT-Enhanced Pose Optimization Network (IE-PONet) for high-precision 3D pose estimation and motion optimization of track and field athletes. IE-PONet integrates C3D for spatiotemporal feature extraction, OpenPose for real-time keypoint detection, and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. Experimental results on NTURGB+D and FineGYM datasets demonstrate superior performance, with AP\(^p50\) scores of 90.5 and 91.0, and mAP scores of 74.3 and 74.0, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the essential roles of each module in enhancing model accuracy. IE-PONet provides a robust tool for athletic performance analysis and optimization, offering precise technical insights for training and injury prevention. Future work will focus on further model optimization, multimodal data integration, and developing real-time feedback mechanisms to enhance practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in TTS models, a consistent and robust human evaluation framework is still lacking. For example, MOS tests fail to differentiate between similar models, and CMOS's pairwise comparisons are time-intensive. The MUSHRA test is a promising alternative for evaluating multiple TTS systems simultaneously, but in this work we show that its reliance on matching human reference speech unduly penalises the scores of modern TTS systems that can exceed human speech quality. More specifically, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the MUSHRA test, focusing on its sensitivity to factors such as rater variability, listener fatigue, and reference bias. Based on our extensive evaluation involving 471 human listeners across Hindi and Tamil we identify two primary shortcomings: (i) reference-matching bias, where raters are unduly influenced by the human reference, and (ii) judgement ambiguity, arising from a lack of clear fine-grained guidelines. To address these issues, we propose two refined variants of the MUSHRA test. The first variant enables fairer ratings for synthesized samples that surpass human reference quality. The second variant reduces ambiguity, as indicated by the relatively lower variance across raters. By combining these approaches, we achieve both more reliable and more fine-grained assessments. We also release MANGO, a massive dataset of 47,100 human ratings, the first-of-its-kind collection for Indian languages, aiding in analyzing human preferences and developing automatic metrics for evaluating TTS systems.</description>

      <title>LazyDINO: Fast, scalable, and efficiently amortized Bayesian inversion via structure-exploiting and surrogate-driven measure transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LazyDINO, a transport map variational inference method for fast, scalable, and efficiently amortized solutions of high-dimensional nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems with expensive parameter-to-observable (PtO) maps. Our method consists of an offline phase in which we construct a derivative-informed neural surrogate of the PtO map using joint samples of the PtO map and its Jacobian. During the online phase, when given observational data, we seek rapid posterior approximation using surrogate-driven training of a lazy map [Brennan et al., NeurIPS, (2020)], i.e., a structure-exploiting transport map with low-dimensional nonlinearity. The trained lazy map then produces approximate posterior samples or density evaluations. Our surrogate construction is optimized for amortized Bayesian inversion using lazy map variational inference. We show that (i) the derivative-based reduced basis architecture [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., 388 (2022)] minimizes the upper bound on the expected error in surrogate posterior approximation, and (ii) the derivative-informed training formulation [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., J. Comput. Phys., 496 (2024)] minimizes the expected error due to surrogate-driven transport map optimization. Our numerical results demonstrate that LazyDINO is highly efficient in cost amortization for Bayesian inversion. We observe one to two orders of magnitude reduction of offline cost for accurate posterior approximation, compared to simulation-based amortized inference via conditional transport and conventional surrogate-driven transport. In particular, LazyDINO outperforms Laplace approximation consistently using fewer than 1000 offline samples, while other amortized inference methods struggle and sometimes fail at 16,000 offline samples.</description>

      <title>Testing classical properties from quantum data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many properties of Boolean functions can be tested far more efficiently than the function can be learned. However, this advantage often disappears when testers are limited to random samples--a natural setting for data science--rather than queries. In this work we investigate the quantum version of this scenario: quantum algorithms that test properties of a function $f$ solely from quantum data in the form of copies of the function state for $f$.
  For three well-established properties, we show that the speedup lost when restricting classical testers to samples can be recovered by testers that use quantum data. For monotonicity testing, we give a quantum algorithm that uses $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2)$ function state copies as compared to the $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$ samples required classically. We also present $\mathcal{O}(1)$-copy testers for symmetry and triangle-freeness, comparing favorably to classical lower bounds of $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ and $\Omega(n)$ samples respectively. These algorithms are time-efficient and necessarily include techniques beyond the Fourier sampling approaches applied to earlier testing problems.
  These results make the case for a general study of the advantages afforded by quantum data for testing. We contribute to this project by complementing our upper bounds with a lower bound of $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ for monotonicity testing from quantum data in the proximity regime $\varepsilon\leq\mathcal{O}(n^{-3/2})$. This implies a strict separation between testing monotonicity from quantum data and from quantum queries--where $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n)$ queries suffice when $\varepsilon=\Theta(n^{-3/2})$. We also exhibit a testing problem that can be solved from $\mathcal{O}(1)$ classical queries but requires $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ function state copies, complementing a separation of the same magnitude in the opposite direction derived from the Forrelation problem.</description>

      <title>ACING: Actor-Critic for Instruction Learning in Black-Box Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks vastly depends on the quality of the instructions, which often require fine-tuning through extensive human effort. This highlights the need for automated instruction optimization; however, this optimization is particularly challenging when dealing with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients remain inaccessible. We propose ACING, a task-specific prompt optimization approach framed as a stateless continuous-action Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, known as the continuum bandit setting. ACING leverages an actor-critic-based method to optimize prompts, learning from non-differentiable reward signals. We validate ACING by optimizing prompts for ChatGPT on 30 instruction-based tasks. ACING consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving a median score improvement of 10 percentage points. Furthermore, ACING not only recovers but also surpasses human-crafted expert instructions, achieving up to a 39 percentage point improvement against human benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: The Dreamer agent provides various benefits of Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) such as sample efficiency, reusable knowledge, and safe planning. However, its world model and policy networks inherit the limitations of recurrent neural networks and thus an important question is how an MBRL framework can benefit from the recent advances of transformers and what the challenges are in doing so. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based MBRL agent, called TransDreamer. We first introduce the Transformer State-Space Model, a world model that leverages a transformer for dynamics predictions. We then share this world model with a transformer-based policy network and obtain stability in training a transformer-based RL agent. In experiments, we apply the proposed model to 2D visual RL and 3D first-person visual RL tasks both requiring long-range memory access for memory-based reasoning. We show that the proposed model outperforms Dreamer in these complex tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Pareto Set Identification with Contaminated Bandit Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Pareto set identification (PSI) problem in multi-objective multi-armed bandits (MO-MAB) with contaminated reward observations. At each arm pull, with some fixed probability, the true reward samples are replaced with the samples from an arbitrary contamination distribution chosen by an adversary. We consider ({\alpha}, {\delta})-PAC PSI and propose a sample median-based multi-objective adaptive elimination algorithm that returns an ({\alpha}, {\delta})- PAC Pareto set upon termination with a sample complexity bound that depends on the contamination probability. As the contamination probability decreases, we recover the wellknown sample complexity results in MO-MAB. We compare the proposed algorithm with a mean-based method from MO-MAB literature, as well as an extended version that uses median estimators, on several PSI problems under adversarial corruptions, including review bombing and diabetes management. Our numerical results support our theoretical findings and demonstrate that robust algorithm design is crucial for accurate PSI under contaminated reward observations.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Fusion Analytics Framework for fMRI Connectivity: Self-Attention Mechanism and Latent Space Item-Response Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There have been several attempts to use deep learning based on brain fMRI signals to classify cognitive impairment diseases. However, deep learning is a hidden black box model that makes it difficult to interpret the process of classification. To address this issue, we propose a novel analytical framework that interprets the classification result from deep learning processes. We first derive the region of interest (ROI) functional connectivity network (FCN) by embedding functions based on their similar signal patterns. Then, using the self-attention equipped deep learning model, we classify diseases based on their FCN. Finally, in order to interpret the classification results, we employ a latent space item-response interaction network model to identify the significant functions that exhibit distinct connectivity patterns when compared to other diseases. The application of this proposed framework to the four types of cognitive impairment shows that our approach is valid for determining the significant ROI functions.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Invariant Learning for Distribution Shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning robust models under distribution shifts between training and test datasets is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While learning invariant features across environments is a popular approach, it often assumes that these features are fully observed in both training and test sets-a condition frequently violated in practice. When models rely on invariant features absent in the test set, their robustness in new environments can deteriorate. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel learning principle called the Sufficient Invariant Learning (SIL) framework, which focuses on learning a sufficient subset of invariant features rather than relying on a single feature. After demonstrating the limitation of existing invariant learning methods, we propose a new algorithm, Adaptive Sharpness-aware Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (ASGDRO), to learn diverse invariant features by seeking common flat minima across the environments. We theoretically demonstrate that finding a common flat minima enables robust predictions based on diverse invariant features. Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, including our new benchmark, confirm ASGDRO's robustness against distribution shifts, highlighting the limitations of existing methods.</description>

      <title>Improving Multi-task Learning via Seeking Task-based Flat Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a widely-used and powerful learning paradigm for training deep neural networks that allows learning more than one objective by a single backbone. Compared to training tasks separately, MTL significantly reduces computational costs, improves data efficiency, and potentially enhances model performance by leveraging knowledge across tasks. Hence, it has been adopted in a variety of applications, ranging from computer vision to natural language processing and speech recognition. Among them, there is an emerging line of work in MTL that focuses on manipulating the task gradient to derive an ultimate gradient descent direction to benefit all tasks. Despite achieving impressive results on many benchmarks, directly applying these approaches without using appropriate regularization techniques might lead to suboptimal solutions on real-world problems. In particular, standard training that minimizes the empirical loss on the training data can easily suffer from overfitting to low-resource tasks or be spoiled by noisy-labeled ones, which can cause negative transfer between tasks and overall performance drop. To alleviate such problems, we propose to leverage a recently introduced training method, named Sharpness-aware Minimization, which can enhance model generalization ability on single-task learning. Accordingly, we present a novel MTL training methodology, encouraging the model to find task-based flat minima for coherently improving its generalization capability on all tasks. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of applications to demonstrate the merit of our proposed approach to existing gradient-based MTL methods, as suggested by our developed theory.</description>

      <title>Contextual Combinatorial Bandits with Probabilistically Triggered Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study contextual combinatorial bandits with probabilistically triggered arms (C$^2$MAB-T) under a variety of smoothness conditions that capture a wide range of applications, such as contextual cascading bandits and contextual influence maximization bandits. Under the triggering probability modulated (TPM) condition, we devise the C$^2$-UCB-T algorithm and propose a novel analysis that achieves an $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{KT})$ regret bound, removing a potentially exponentially large factor $O(1/p_{\min})$, where $d$ is the dimension of contexts, $p_{\min}$ is the minimum positive probability that any arm can be triggered, and batch-size $K$ is the maximum number of arms that can be triggered per round. Under the variance modulated (VM) or triggering probability and variance modulated (TPVM) conditions, we propose a new variance-adaptive algorithm VAC$^2$-UCB and derive a regret bound $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$, which is independent of the batch-size $K$. As a valuable by-product, our analysis technique and variance-adaptive algorithm can be applied to the CMAB-T and C$^2$MAB setting, improving existing results there as well. We also include experiments that demonstrate the improved performance of our algorithms compared with benchmark algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Counterpart Fairness -- Addressing Systematic between-group Differences in Fairness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18160v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When using machine learning to aid decision-making, it is critical to ensure that an algorithmic decision is fair and does not discriminate against specific individuals/groups, particularly those from underprivileged populations. Existing group fairness methods aim to ensure equal outcomes (such as loan approval rates) across groups delineated by protected variables like race or gender. However, in cases where systematic differences between groups play a significant role in outcomes, these methods may overlook the influence of non-protected variables that can systematically vary across groups. These confounding factors can affect fairness evaluations, making it challenging to assess whether disparities are due to discrimination or inherent differences. Therefore, we recommend a more refined and comprehensive fairness index that accounts for both the systematic differences within groups and the multifaceted, intertwined confounding effects. The proposed index evaluates fairness on counterparts (pairs of individuals who are similar with respect to the task of interest but from different groups), whose group identities cannot be distinguished algorithmically by exploring confounding factors. To identify counterparts, we developed a two-step matching method inspired by propensity score and metric learning. In addition, we introduced a counterpart-based statistical fairness index, called Counterpart Fairness (CFair), to assess the fairness of machine learning models. Empirical results on the MIMIC and COMPAS datasets indicate that standard group-based fairness metrics may not adequately inform about the degree of unfairness present in predictions, as revealed through CFair.</description>

      <title>RLtools: A Fast, Portable Deep Reinforcement Learning Library for Continuous Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) can yield capable agents and control policies in several domains but is commonly plagued by prohibitively long training times. Additionally, in the case of continuous control problems, the applicability of learned policies on real-world embedded devices is limited due to the lack of real-time guarantees and portability of existing libraries. To address these challenges, we present RLtools, a dependency-free, header-only, pure C++ library for deep supervised and reinforcement learning. Its novel architecture allows RLtools to be used on a wide variety of platforms, from HPC clusters over workstations and laptops to smartphones, smartwatches, and microcontrollers. Specifically, due to the tight integration of the RL algorithms with simulation environments, RLtools can solve popular RL problems up to 76 times faster than other popular RL frameworks. We also benchmark the inference on a diverse set of microcontrollers and show that in most cases our optimized implementation is by far the fastest. Finally, RLtools enables the first-ever demonstration of training a deep RL algorithm directly on a microcontroller, giving rise to the field of TinyRL. The source code as well as documentation and live demos are available through our project page at https://rl.tools.</description>

      <title>T-GAE: Transferable Graph Autoencoder for Network Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network alignment is the task of establishing one-to-one correspondences between the nodes of different graphs. Although finding a plethora of applications in high-impact domains, this task is known to be NP-hard in its general form. Existing optimization algorithms do not scale up as the size of the graphs increases. While being able to reduce the matching complexity, current GNN approaches fit a deep neural network on each graph and requires re-train on unseen samples, which is time and memory inefficient. To tackle both challenges we propose T-GAE, a transferable graph autoencoder framework that leverages transferability and stability of GNNs to achieve efficient network alignment on out-of-distribution graphs without retraining. We prove that GNN-generated embeddings can achieve more accurate alignment compared to classical spectral methods. Our experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that T-GAE outperforms the state-of-the-art optimization method and the best GNN approach by up to 38.7% and 50.8%, respectively, while being able to reduce 90% of the training time when matching out-of-distribution large scale networks. We conduct ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed encoder architecture and training objective in enhancing the expressiveness of GNNs to match perturbed graphs. T-GAE is also proved to be flexible to utilize matching algorithms of different complexities. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jason-Tree/T-GAE.</description>

      <title>Variational Graph Autoencoder for Heterogeneous Information Networks with Missing and Inaccurate Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), which consist of various types of nodes and edges, have recently demonstrated excellent performance in graph mining. However, most existing heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) ignore the problems of missing attributes, inaccurate attributes and scarce labels for nodes, which limits their expressiveness. In this paper, we propose a generative self-supervised model GraMI to address these issues simultaneously. Specifically, GraMI first initializes all the nodes in the graph with a low-dimensional representation matrix. After that, based on the variational graph autoencoder framework, GraMI learns both node-level and attribute-level embeddings in the encoder, which can provide fine-grained semantic information to construct node attributes. In the decoder, GraMI reconstructs both links and attributes. Instead of directly reconstructing raw features for attributed nodes, GraMI generates the initial low-dimensional representation matrix for all the nodes, based on which raw features of attributed nodes are further reconstructed to leverage accurate attributes. In this way, GraMI can not only complete informative features for non-attributed nodes, but rectify inaccurate ones for attributed nodes. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of GraMI in tackling HINs with missing and inaccurate attributes.</description>

      <title>XLand-MiniGrid: Scalable Meta-Reinforcement Learning Environments in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the diversity and depth of XLand and the simplicity and minimalism of MiniGrid, we present XLand-MiniGrid, a suite of tools and grid-world environments for meta-reinforcement learning research. Written in JAX, XLand-MiniGrid is designed to be highly scalable and can potentially run on GPU or TPU accelerators, democratizing large-scale experimentation with limited resources. Along with the environments, XLand-MiniGrid provides pre-sampled benchmarks with millions of unique tasks of varying difficulty and easy-to-use baselines that allow users to quickly start training adaptive agents. In addition, we have conducted a preliminary analysis of scaling and generalization, showing that our baselines are capable of reaching millions of steps per second during training and validating that the proposed benchmarks are challenging. XLand-MiniGrid is open-source and available at https://github.com/dunnolab/xland-minigrid.</description>

      <title>A universal approximation theorem for nonlinear resistive networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resistor networks have recently attracted interest as analog computing platforms for machine learning, particularly due to their compatibility with the Equilibrium Propagation training framework. In this work, we explore the computational capabilities of these networks. We prove that electrical networks consisting of voltage sources, linear resistors, diodes, and voltage-controlled voltage sources (VCVS) can approximate any continuous function to arbitrary precision. Central to our proof is a method for translating a ReLU neural network into an approximately equivalent electrical network comprising these four elements. Our proof relies on two assumptions: (a) circuit elements are ideal, and (b) variable resistor conductances and VCVS amplification factors can take any value (arbitrarily small or large). Our findings provide insights that could guide the development of universal self-learning electrical networks.</description>

      <title>Adapting Amidst Degradation: Cross Domain Li-ion Battery Health Estimation via Physics-Guided Test-Time Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Health modeling of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial for safe and efficient energy management and carries significant socio-economic implications. Although Machine Learning (ML)-based State of Health (SOH) estimation methods have made significant progress in accuracy, the scarcity of high-quality LIB data remains a major obstacle. Existing transfer learning methods for cross-domain LIB SOH estimation have significantly alleviated the labeling burden of target LIB data, however, they still require sufficient unlabeled target data (UTD) for effective adaptation to the target domain. Collecting this UTD is challenging due to the time-consuming nature of degradation experiments. To address this issue, we introduce a practical Test-Time Training framework, BatteryTTT, which adapts the model continually using each UTD collected amidst degradation, thereby significantly reducing data collection time. To fully utilize each UTD, BatteryTTT integrates the inherent physical laws of modern LIBs into self-supervised learning, termed Physcics-Guided Test-Time Training. Additionally, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) in battery sequence modeling by evaluating their performance in SOH estimation through model reprogramming and prefix prompt adaptation. The combination of BatteryTTT and LLM modeling, termed GPT4Battery, achieves state-of-the-art generalization results across current LIB benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical value and scalability of our approach by deploying it in our real-world battery management system (BMS) for 300Ah large-scale energy storage LIBs.</description>

      <title>KTO: Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01306v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kahneman &amp; Tversky's $\textit{prospect theory}$ tells us that humans perceive random variables in a biased but well-defined manner (1992); for example, humans are famously loss-averse. We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with human feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases -- the success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed to them belonging to a family of loss functions that we call $\textit{human-aware losses}$ (HALOs). However, the utility functions these methods attribute to humans still differ from those in the prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, we propose a HALO that directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. We call this approach KTO, and it matches or exceeds the performance of preference-based methods at scales from 1B to 30B, despite only learning from a binary signal of whether an output is desirable. More broadly, our work suggests that there is no one HALO that is universally superior; the best loss depends on the inductive biases most appropriate for a given setting, an oft-overlooked consideration.</description>

      <title>Approximating Families of Sharp Solutions to Fisher's Equation with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper employs physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve Fisher's equation, a fundamental reaction-diffusion system with both simplicity and significance. The focus is on investigating Fisher's equation under conditions of large reaction rate coefficients, where solutions exhibit steep traveling waves that often present challenges for traditional numerical methods. To address these challenges, a residual weighting scheme is introduced in the network training to mitigate the difficulties associated with standard PINN approaches. Additionally, a specialized network architecture designed to capture traveling wave solutions is explored. The paper also assesses the ability of PINNs to approximate a family of solutions by generalizing across multiple reaction rate coefficients. The proposed method demonstrates high effectiveness in solving Fisher's equation with large reaction rate coefficients and shows promise for meshfree solutions of generalized reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>PQA: Zero-shot Protein Question Answering for Free-form Scientific Enquiry with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding protein structure and function is crucial in biology. However, current computational methods are often task-specific and resource-intensive. To address this, we propose zero-shot Protein Question Answering (PQA), a task designed to answer a wide range of protein-related queries without task-specific training. The success of PQA hinges on high-quality datasets and robust evaluation strategies, both of which are lacking in current research. Existing datasets suffer from biases, noise, and lack of evolutionary context, while current evaluation methods fail to accurately assess model performance. We introduce the Pika framework to overcome these limitations. Pika comprises a curated, debiased dataset tailored for PQA and a biochemically relevant benchmarking strategy. We also propose multimodal large language models as a strong baseline for PQA, leveraging their natural language processing and knowledge. This approach promises a more flexible and efficient way to explore protein properties, advancing protein research. Our comprehensive PQA framework, Pika, including dataset, code, and model checkpoints, is openly accessible on github.com/EMCarrami/Pika, promoting wider research in the field.</description>

      <title>The Implicit Bias of Heterogeneity towards Invariance: A Study of Multi-Environment Matrix Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models are expected to engage in invariance learning, which involves distinguishing the core relations that remain consistent across varying environments to ensure the predictions are safe, robust and fair. While existing works consider specific algorithms to realize invariance learning, we show that model has the potential to learn invariance through standard training procedures. In other words, this paper studies the implicit bias of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) over heterogeneous data and shows that the implicit bias drives the model learning towards an invariant solution. We call the phenomenon the implicit invariance learning. Specifically, we theoretically investigate the multi-environment low-rank matrix sensing problem where in each environment, the signal comprises (i) a lower-rank invariant part shared across all environments; and (ii) a significantly varying environment-dependent spurious component. The key insight is, through simply employing the large step size large-batch SGD sequentially in each environment without any explicit regularization, the oscillation caused by heterogeneity can provably prevent model learning spurious signals. The model reaches the invariant solution after certain iterations. In contrast, model learned using pooled SGD over all data would simultaneously learn both the invariant and spurious signals. Overall, we unveil another implicit bias that is a result of the symbiosis between the heterogeneity of data and modern algorithms, which is, to the best of our knowledge, first in the literature.</description>

      <title>Multistep Consistency Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models are relatively easy to train but require many steps to generate samples. Consistency models are far more difficult to train, but generate samples in a single step.
  In this paper we propose Multistep Consistency Models: A unification between Consistency Models (Song et al., 2023) and TRACT (Berthelot et al., 2023) that can interpolate between a consistency model and a diffusion model: a trade-off between sampling speed and sampling quality. Specifically, a 1-step consistency model is a conventional consistency model whereas a $\infty$-step consistency model is a diffusion model.
  Multistep Consistency Models work really well in practice. By increasing the sample budget from a single step to 2-8 steps, we can train models more easily that generate higher quality samples, while retaining much of the sampling speed benefits. Notable results are 1.4 FID on Imagenet 64 in 8 step and 2.1 FID on Imagenet128 in 8 steps with consistency distillation, using simple losses without adversarial training. We also show that our method scales to a text-to-image diffusion model, generating samples that are close to the quality of the original model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09273v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When using machine learning for automated prediction, it is important to account for fairness in the prediction. Fairness in machine learning aims to ensure that biases in the data and model inaccuracies do not lead to discriminatory decisions. E.g., predictions from fair machine learning models should not discriminate against sensitive variables such as sexual orientation and ethnicity. The training data often in obtained from social surveys. In social surveys, oftentimes the data collection process is a strata sampling, e.g. due to cost restrictions. In strata samples, the assumption of independence between the observation is not fulfilled. Hence, if the machine learning models do not account for the strata correlations, the results may be biased. Especially high is the bias in cases where the strata assignment is correlated to the variable of interest. We present in this paper an algorithm that can handle both problems simultaneously, and we demonstrate the impact of stratified sampling on the quality of fair machine learning predictions in a reproducible simulation study.</description>

Abstract: The problem of an optimal mapping between Hilbert spaces $IN$ of $\left|\psi\right\rangle$ and $OUT$ of $\left|\phi\right\rangle$ based on a set of wavefunction measurements (within a phase) $\psi_l \to \phi_l$, $l=1\dots M$, is formulated as an optimization problem maximizing the total fidelity $\sum_{l=1}^{M} \omega^{(l)} \left|\langle\phi_l|\mathcal{U}|\psi_l\rangle\right|^2$ subject to probability preservation constraints on $\mathcal{U}$ (partial unitarity). The constructed operator $\mathcal{U}$ can be considered as an $IN$ to $OUT$ quantum channel; it is a partially unitary rectangular matrix (an isometry) of dimension $\dim(OUT) \times \dim(IN)$ transforming operators as $A^{OUT}=\mathcal{U} A^{IN} \mathcal{U}^{\dagger}$. An iterative algorithm for finding the global maximum of this optimization problem is developed, and its application to a number of problems is demonstrated. A software product implementing the algorithm is available from the authors.</description>

      <title>Smoke and Mirrors in Causal Downstream Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning and AI have the potential to transform data-driven scientific discovery, enabling accurate predictions for several scientific phenomena. As many scientific questions are inherently causal, this paper looks at the causal inference task of treatment effect estimation, where the outcome of interest is recorded in high-dimensional observations in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Despite being the simplest possible causal setting and a perfect fit for deep learning, we theoretically find that many common choices in the literature may lead to biased estimates. To test the practical impact of these considerations, we recorded ISTAnt, the first real-world benchmark for causal inference downstream tasks on high-dimensional observations as an RCT studying how garden ants (Lasius neglectus) respond to microparticles applied onto their colony members by hygienic grooming. Comparing 6 480 models fine-tuned from state-of-the-art visual backbones, we find that the sampling and modeling choices significantly affect the accuracy of the causal estimate, and that classification accuracy is not a proxy thereof. We further validated the analysis, repeating it on a synthetically generated visual data set controlling the causal model. Our results suggest that future benchmarks should carefully consider real downstream scientific questions, especially causal ones. Further, we highlight guidelines for representation learning methods to help answer causal questions in the sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Quantum-informed Tensor Adaptation (QuanTA), a novel, easy-to-implement, fine-tuning method with no inference overhead for large-scale pre-trained language models. By leveraging quantum-inspired methods derived from quantum circuit structures, QuanTA enables efficient high-rank fine-tuning, surpassing the limitations of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)--low-rank approximation may fail for complicated downstream tasks. Our approach is theoretically supported by the universality theorem and the rank representation theorem to achieve efficient high-rank adaptations. Experiments demonstrate that QuanTA significantly enhances commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, and scalability compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, QuanTA shows superior performance with fewer trainable parameters compared to other approaches and can be designed to integrate with existing fine-tuning algorithms for further improvement, providing a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large language models and advancing state-of-the-art in natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Multivariant Multi-Armed Bandits with Applications to Episodic Reinforcement Learning and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework of combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) with multivariant and probabilistically triggering arms (CMAB-MT), where the outcome of each arm is a $d$-dimensional multivariant random variable and the feedback follows a general arm triggering process. Compared with existing CMAB works, CMAB-MT not only enhances the modeling power but also allows improved results by leveraging distinct statistical properties for multivariant random variables. For CMAB-MT, we propose a general 1-norm multivariant and triggering probability-modulated smoothness condition, and an optimistic CUCB-MT algorithm built upon this condition. Our framework can include many important problems as applications, such as episodic reinforcement learning (RL) and probabilistic maximum coverage for goods distribution, all of which meet the above smoothness condition and achieve matching or improved regret bounds compared to existing works. Through our new framework, we build the first connection between the episodic RL and CMAB literature, by offering a new angle to solve the episodic RL through the lens of CMAB, which may encourage more interactions between these two important directions.</description>

      <title>ShiftAddLLM: Accelerating Pretrained LLMs via Post-Training Multiplication-Less Reparameterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05981v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on language tasks but face challenges when deployed on resource-constrained devices due to their extensive parameters and reliance on dense multiplications, resulting in high memory demands and latency bottlenecks. Shift-and-add reparameterization offers a promising solution by replacing costly multiplications with hardware-friendly primitives in both the attention and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers of an LLM. However, current reparameterization techniques require training from scratch or full parameter fine-tuning to restore accuracy, which is resource-intensive for LLMs. To address this, we propose accelerating pretrained LLMs through post-training shift-and-add reparameterization, creating efficient multiplication-free models, dubbed ShiftAddLLM. Specifically, we quantize each weight matrix into binary matrices paired with group-wise scaling factors. The associated multiplications are reparameterized into (1) shifts between activations and scaling factors and (2) queries and adds according to the binary matrices. To reduce accuracy loss, we present a multi-objective optimization method to minimize both weight and output activation reparameterization errors. Additionally, based on varying sensitivity across layers to reparameterization, we develop an automated bit allocation strategy to further reduce memory usage and latency. Experiments on five LLM families and eight tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of ShiftAddLLM, achieving average perplexity improvements of 5.6 and 22.7 points at comparable or lower latency compared to the most competitive quantized LLMs at 3 and 2 bits, respectively, and more than 80% memory and energy reductions over the original LLMs. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/ShiftAddLLM.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Class-wise Coverage via Augmented Label Rank Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06818v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an emerging uncertainty quantification framework that allows us to construct a prediction set to cover the true label with a pre-specified marginal or conditional probability. Although the valid coverage guarantee has been extensively studied for classification problems, CP often produces large prediction sets which may not be practically useful. This issue is exacerbated for the setting of class-conditional coverage on imbalanced classification tasks with many and/or imbalanced classes. This paper proposes the Rank Calibrated Class-conditional CP (RC3P) algorithm to reduce the prediction set sizes to achieve class-conditional coverage, where the valid coverage holds for each class. In contrast to the standard class-conditional CP (CCP) method that uniformly thresholds the class-wise conformity score for each class, the augmented label rank calibration step allows RC3P to selectively iterate this class-wise thresholding subroutine only for a subset of classes whose class-wise top-k error is small. We prove that agnostic to the classifier and data distribution, RC3P achieves class-wise coverage. We also show that RC3P reduces the size of prediction sets compared to the CCP method. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that RC3P achieves class-wise coverage and 26.25% reduction in prediction set sizes on average.</description>

      <title>MaIL: Improving Imitation Learning with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents Mamba Imitation Learning (MaIL), a novel imitation learning (IL) architecture that provides an alternative to state-of-the-art (SoTA) Transformer-based policies. MaIL leverages Mamba, a state-space model designed to selectively focus on key features of the data. While Transformers are highly effective in data-rich environments due to their dense attention mechanisms, they can struggle with smaller datasets, often leading to overfitting or suboptimal representation learning. In contrast, Mamba's architecture enhances representation learning efficiency by focusing on key features and reducing model complexity. This approach mitigates overfitting and enhances generalization, even when working with limited data. Extensive evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that MaIL consistently outperforms Transformers on all LIBERO tasks with limited data and matches their performance when the full dataset is available. Additionally, MaIL's effectiveness is validated through its superior performance in three real robot experiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/ALRhub/MaIL.</description>

      <title>GraphSnapShot: Graph Machine Learning Acceleration with Fast Storage and Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our recent research, we have developed a framework called GraphSnapShot, which has been proven an useful tool for graph learning acceleration. GraphSnapShot is a framework for fast cache, storage, retrieval and computation for graph learning. It can quickly store and update the local topology of graph structure and allows us to track patterns in the structure of graph networks, just like take snapshots of the graphs. In experiments, GraphSnapShot shows efficiency, it can achieve up to 30% training acceleration and 73% memory reduction for lossless graph ML training compared to current baselines such as dgl.This technique is particular useful for large dynamic graph learning tasks such as social media analysis and recommendation systems to process complex relationships between entities.
  The code for GraphSnapShot is publicly available at https://github.com/NoakLiu/GraphSnapShot.</description>

      <title>Wavelets Are All You Need for Autoregressive Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we take a new approach to autoregressive image generation that is based on two main ingredients. The first is wavelet image coding, which allows to tokenize the visual details of an image from coarse to fine details by ordering the information starting with the most significant bits of the most significant wavelet coefficients. The second is a variant of a language transformer whose architecture is re-designed and optimized for token sequences in this 'wavelet language'. The transformer learns the significant statistical correlations within a token sequence, which are the manifestations of well-known correlations between the wavelet subbands at various resolutions. We show experimental results with conditioning on the generation process.</description>

      <title>Separable DeepONet: Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality in Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deep operator network (DeepONet) is a popular neural operator architecture that has shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by using deep neural networks to map between infinite-dimensional function spaces. In the absence of labeled datasets, we utilize the PDE residual loss to learn the physical system, an approach known as physics-informed DeepONet. This method faces significant computational challenges, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality, as the computational cost increases exponentially with finer discretization. In this paper, we introduce the Separable DeepONet framework to address these challenges and improve scalability for high-dimensional PDEs. Our approach involves a factorization technique where sub-networks handle individual one-dimensional coordinates, thereby reducing the number of forward passes and the size of the Jacobian matrix. By using forward-mode automatic differentiation, we further optimize the computational cost related to the Jacobian matrix. As a result, our modifications lead to a linear scaling of computational cost with discretization density, making Separable DeepONet suitable for high-dimensional PDEs. We validate the effectiveness of the separable architecture through three benchmark PDE models: the viscous Burgers equation, Biot's consolidation theory, and a parametrized heat equation. In all cases, our proposed framework achieves comparable or improved accuracy while significantly reducing computational time compared to conventional DeepONet. These results demonstrate the potential of Separable DeepONet in efficiently solving complex, high-dimensional PDEs, advancing the field of physics-informed machine learning.</description>

      <title>RELIEF: Reinforcement Learning Empowered Graph Feature Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of the "pre-train, prompt" paradigm has recently extended its generalization ability and data efficiency to graph representation learning, following its achievements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Navigating multiple tasks$\unicode{x2014}$for instance in succession as in continual or lifelong learning, or in distributions as in meta or multi-task learning$\unicode{x2014}$requires some notion of adaptation. Evolution over timescales of millennia has imbued humans and other animals with highly effective adaptive learning and decision-making strategies. Central to these functions are so-called neuromodulatory systems. In this work we introduce an abstract framework for integrating theories and evidence from neuroscience and the cognitive sciences into the design of adaptive artificial reinforcement learning algorithms. We give a concrete instance of this framework built on literature surrounding the neuromodulators Acetylcholine (ACh) and Noradrenaline (NA), and empirically validate the effectiveness of the resulting adaptive algorithm in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit problem. We conclude with a theory-based experiment proposal providing an avenue to link our framework back to efforts in experimental neuroscience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to optimize dealership network planning for a luxury car manufacturer in the U.S. By conducting a comprehensive literature review on dealership location determinants, the study identifies 65 county-level explanatory variables, augmented by two additional measures of regional interconnectedness derived from social and mobility data. An ablation study involving 34 variable combinations and ten state-of-the-art GNN operators reveals key insights into the predictive power of various variables, particularly highlighting the significance of competition, demographic factors, and mobility patterns in influencing dealership location decisions. The analysis pinpoints seven specific counties as promising targets for network expansion. This research not only illustrates the effectiveness of GNNs in solving complex geospatial decision-making problems but also provides actionable recommendations and valuable methodological insights for industry practitioners.</description>

      <title>A semi-supervised learning using over-parameterized regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is an important theme in machine learning, in which we have a few labeled samples and many unlabeled samples. In this paper, for SSL in a regression problem, we consider a method of incorporating information on unlabeled samples into kernel functions. As a typical implementation, we employ Gaussian kernels whose centers are labeled and unlabeled input samples. Since the number of coefficients is larger than the number of labeled samples in this setting, this is an over-parameterized regression roblem. A ridge regression is a typical estimation method under this setting. In this paper, alternatively, we consider to apply the minimum norm least squares (MNLS), which is known as a helpful tool for understanding deep learning behavior while it may not be application oriented. Then, in applying the MNLS for SSL, we established several methods based on feature extraction/dimension reduction in the SVD (singular value decomposition) representation of a Gram type matrix appeared in the over-parameterized regression problem. The methods are thresholding according to singular value magnitude with cross validation, hard-thresholding with cross validation, universal thresholding and bridge thresholding methods. The first one is equivalent to a method using a well-known low rank approximation of a Gram type matrix. We refer to these methods as SVD regression methods. In the experiments for real data, depending on datasets, clear superiority of the proposed SVD regression methods over ridge regression methods was observed. And, depending on datasets, incorporation of information on unlabeled input samples into kernels was found to be clearly effective.</description>

      <title>TFG: Unified Training-Free Guidance for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an unconditional diffusion model and a predictor for a target property of interest (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. Existing methods, though effective in various individual applications, often lack theoretical grounding and rigorous testing on extensive benchmarks. As a result, they could even fail on simple tasks, and applying them to a new problem becomes unavoidably difficult. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework encompassing existing methods as special cases, unifying the study of training-free guidance into the analysis of an algorithm-agnostic design space. Via theoretical and empirical investigation, we propose an efficient and effective hyper-parameter searching strategy that can be readily applied to any downstream task. We systematically benchmark across 7 diffusion models on 16 tasks with 40 targets, and improve performance by 8.5% on average. Our framework and benchmark offer a solid foundation for conditional generation in a training-free manner.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Driven Synthesis: Enhancing Dataset Distillation through Directed Weight Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sharp increase in data-related expenses has motivated research into condensing datasets while retaining the most informative features. Dataset distillation has thus recently come to the fore. This paradigm generates synthetic datasets that are representative enough to replace the original dataset in training a neural network. To avoid redundancy in these synthetic datasets, it is crucial that each element contains unique features and remains diverse from others during the synthesis stage. In this paper, we provide a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of diversity within synthesized datasets. We argue that enhancing diversity can improve the parallelizable yet isolated synthesizing approach. Specifically, we introduce a novel method that employs dynamic and directed weight adjustment techniques to modulate the synthesis process, thereby maximizing the representativeness and diversity of each synthetic instance. Our method ensures that each batch of synthetic data mirrors the characteristics of a large, varying subset of the original dataset. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, including CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in producing diverse and representative synthetic datasets with minimal computational expense.

      <title>Learning Personalized Treatment Decisions in Precision Medicine: Disentangling Treatment Assignment Bias in Counterfactual Outcome Prediction and Biomarker Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision medicine has the potential to tailor treatment decisions to individual patients using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), but it faces significant challenges due to complex biases in clinical observational data and the high-dimensional nature of biological data. This study models various types of treatment assignment biases using mutual information and investigates their impact on ML models for counterfactual prediction and biomarker identification. Unlike traditional counterfactual benchmarks that rely on fixed treatment policies, our work focuses on modeling different characteristics of the underlying observational treatment policy in distinct clinical settings. We validate our approach through experiments on toy datasets, semi-synthetic tumor cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data, and real-world biological outcomes from drug and CRISPR screens. By incorporating empirical biological mechanisms, we create a more realistic benchmark that reflects the complexities of real-world data. Our analysis reveals that different biases lead to varying model performances, with some biases, especially those unrelated to outcome mechanisms, having minimal effect on prediction accuracy. This highlights the crucial need to account for specific biases in clinical observational data in counterfactual ML model development, ultimately enhancing the personalization of treatment decisions in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>BiSSL: Bilevel Optimization for Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present BiSSL, a first-of-its-kind training framework that introduces bilevel optimization to enhance the alignment between the pretext pre-training and downstream fine-tuning stages in self-supervised learning. BiSSL formulates the pretext and downstream task objectives as the lower- and upper-level objectives in a bilevel optimization problem and serves as an intermediate training stage within the self-supervised learning pipeline. By more explicitly modeling the interdependence of these training stages, BiSSL facilitates enhanced information sharing between them, ultimately leading to a backbone parameter initialization that is better suited for the downstream task. We propose a training algorithm that alternates between optimizing the two objectives defined in BiSSL. Using a ResNet-18 backbone pre-trained with SimCLR on the STL10 dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently achieves improved or competitive classification accuracies across various downstream image classification datasets compared to the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline. Qualitative analyses of the backbone features further suggest that BiSSL enhances the alignment of downstream features in the backbone prior to fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Distributionally robust self-supervised learning for tabular data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subpopulations of tabular data, known as error slices. Learning robust representation in presence of error slices is challenging, especially in self-supervised settings during the feature reconstruction phase, due to high cardinality features and the complexity of constructing error sets. Traditional robust representation learning methods are largely focused on improving worst group performance in supervised setting in computer vision, leaving a gap in approaches tailored for tabular data. We address this gap by developing a framework to learn robust representation in tabular data during self-supervised pre-training. Our approach utilizes an encoder-decoder model trained with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) loss to learn robust latent representations. This paper applies the Just Train Twice (JTT) and Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) methods during the pre-training phase for tabular data. These methods fine-tune the ERM pre-trained model by up-weighting error-prone samples or creating balanced datasets for specific categorical features. This results in specialized models for each feature, which are then used in an ensemble approach to enhance downstream classification performance. This methodology improves robustness across slices, thus enhancing overall generalization performance. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

      <title>TS-ACL: A Time Series Analytic Continual Learning Framework for Privacy-Preserving and Class-Incremental Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Class-incremental pattern recognition in time series is a significant problem, which aims to learn from continually arriving streaming data examples with incremental classes. A primary challenge in this problem is catastrophic forgetting, where the incorporation of new data samples causes the models to forget previously learned information. While the replay-based methods achieve promising results by storing historical data to address catastrophic forgetting, they come with the invasion of data privacy. On the other hand, the exemplar-free methods preserve privacy but suffer from significantly decreased accuracy. To address these challenges, we proposed TS-ACL, a novel Time Series Analytic Continual Learning framework for privacy-preserving and class-incremental pattern recognition. Identifying gradient descent as the root of catastrophic forgetting, TS-ACL transforms each update of the model into a gradient-free analytical learning process with a closed-form solution. By leveraging a pre-trained frozen encoder for embedding extraction, TS-ACL only needs to recursively update an analytic classifier in a lightweight manner. This way, TS-ACL simultaneously achieves non-forgetting, privacy preservation, and lightweight consumption, making it widely suitable for various applications, particularly in edge computing scenarios. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets confirm the superior and robust performance of TS-ACL compared to existing advanced methods.

      <title>Gradient Normalization Provably Benefits Nonconvex SGD under Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the roles of gradient normalization and clipping in ensuring the convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under heavy-tailed noise. While existing approaches consider gradient clipping indispensable for SGD convergence, we theoretically demonstrate that gradient normalization alone without clipping is sufficient to ensure convergence. Furthermore, we establish that combining gradient normalization with clipping offers significantly improved convergence rates compared to using either technique in isolation, notably as gradient noise diminishes. With these results, our work provides the first theoretical evidence demonstrating the benefits of gradient normalization in SGD under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, we introduce an accelerated SGD variant incorporating gradient normalization and clipping, further enhancing convergence rates under heavy-tailed noise.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Logistic Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework called combinatorial logistic bandits (CLogB), where in each round, a subset of base arms (called the super arm) is selected, with the outcome of each base arm being binary and its expectation following a logistic parametric model. The feedback is governed by a general arm triggering process. Our study covers CLogB with reward functions satisfying two smoothness conditions, capturing application scenarios such as online content delivery, online learning to rank, and dynamic channel allocation. We first propose a simple yet efficient algorithm, CLogUCB, utilizing a variance-agnostic exploration bonus. Under the 1-norm triggering probability modulated (TPM) smoothness condition, CLogUCB achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{\kappa KT})$, where $\tilde{O}$ ignores logarithmic factors, $d$ is the dimension of the feature vector, $\kappa$ represents the nonlinearity of the logistic model, and $K$ is the maximum number of base arms a super arm can trigger. This result improves on prior work by a factor of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa})$. We then enhance CLogUCB with a variance-adaptive version, VA-CLogUCB, which attains a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{KT})$ under the same 1-norm TPM condition, improving another $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ factor. VA-CLogUCB shows even greater promise under the stronger triggering probability and variance modulated (TPVM) condition, achieving a leading $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret, thus removing the additional dependency on the action-size $K$. Furthermore, we enhance the computational efficiency of VA-CLogUCB by eliminating the nonconvex optimization process when the context feature map is time-invariant while maintaining the tight $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms compared to benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When learning an input-output mapping from very few examples, is it better to first infer a latent function that explains the examples, or is it better to directly predict new test outputs, e.g. using a neural network? We study this question on ARC, a highly diverse dataset of abstract reasoning tasks. We train neural models for induction (inferring latent functions) and transduction (directly predicting the test output for a given test input). Our models are trained on synthetic data generated by prompting LLMs to produce Python code specifying a function to be inferred, plus a stochastic subroutine for generating inputs to that function. We find inductive and transductive models solve very different problems, despite training on the same problems, and despite sharing the same neural architecture.</description>

      <title>Identifying Differential Patient Care Through Inverse Intent Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition defined by end-organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. Although the Surviving Sepsis Campaign has launched and has been releasing sepsis treatment guidelines to unify and normalize the care for sepsis patients, it has been reported in numerous studies that disparities in care exist across the trajectory of patient stay in the emergency department and intensive care unit. Here, we apply a number of reinforcement learning techniques including behavioral cloning, imitation learning, and inverse reinforcement learning, to learn the optimal policy in the management of septic patient subgroups using expert demonstrations. Then we estimate the counterfactual optimal policies by applying the model to another subset of unseen medical populations and identify the difference in cure by comparing it to the real policy. Our data comes from the sepsis cohort of MIMIC-IV and the clinical data warehouses of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. The ultimate objective of this work is to use the optimal learned policy function to estimate the counterfactual treatment policy and identify deviations across sub-populations of interest. We hope this approach would help us identify any disparities in care and also changes in cure in response to the publication of national sepsis treatment guidelines.</description>

      <title>Joint Diffusion models in Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce JDCL - a new method for continual learning with generative rehearsal based on joint diffusion models. Neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting defined as abrupt loss in the model's performance when retrained with additional data coming from a different distribution. Generative-replay-based continual learning methods try to mitigate this issue by retraining a model with a combination of new and rehearsal data sampled from a generative model. In this work, we propose to extend this idea by combining a continually trained classifier with a diffusion-based generative model into a single - jointly optimized neural network. We show that such shared parametrization, combined with the knowledge distillation technique allows for stable adaptation to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, where it outperforms recent state-of-the-art generative replay techniques. Additionally, we extend our method to the semi-supervised continual learning setup, where it outperforms competing buffer-based replay techniques, and evaluate, in a self-supervised manner, the quality of trained representations.</description>

      <title>Refusal in LLMs is an Affine Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose affine concept editing (ACE) as an approach for steering language models' behavior by intervening directly in activations. We begin with an affine decomposition of model activation vectors and show that prior methods for steering model behavior correspond to subsets of terms of this decomposition. We then provide a derivation of ACE and use it to control refusal behavior on ten different models, including Llama 3 70B. ACE combines affine subspace projection and activation addition to reliably control the model's refusal responses across prompt types. We evaluate the results using LLM-based scoring on a collection of harmful and harmless prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that ACE consistently achieves more precise control over model behavior than existing methods and generalizes to models where directional ablation via affine subspace projection alone produces incoherent outputs. Code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/steering-llama3 .</description>

Abstract: General movements (GMs) are spontaneous, coordinated body movements in infants that offer valuable insights into the developing nervous system. Assessed through the Prechtl GM Assessment (GMA), GMs are reliable predictors for neurodevelopmental disorders. However, GMA requires specifically trained clinicians, who are limited in number. To scale up newborn screening, there is a need for an algorithm that can automatically classify GMs from infant video recordings. This data poses challenges, including variability in recording length, device type, and setting, with each video coarsely annotated for overall movement quality. In this work, we introduce a tool for extracting features from these recordings and explore various machine learning techniques for automated GM classification.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess Site Closure Time Frames for Soil and Groundwater Contamination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) is gaining prominence as an effective method for managing soil and groundwater contamination due to its cost-efficiency and minimal environmental disruption. Despite its benefits, MNA necessitates extensive groundwater monitoring to ensure that contaminant levels decrease to meet safety standards. This study expands the capabilities of PyLEnM, a Python package designed for long-term environmental monitoring, by incorporating new algorithms to enhance its predictive and analytical functionalities. We introduce methods to estimate the timeframe required for contaminants like Sr-90 and I-129 to reach regulatory safety standards using linear regression and to forecast future contaminant levels with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. Additionally, Random Forest regression is employed to identify factors influencing the time to reach safety standards. Our methods are illustrated using data from the Savannah River Site (SRS) F-Area, where preliminary findings reveal a notable downward trend in contaminant levels, with variability linked to initial concentrations and groundwater flow dynamics. The Bi-LSTM model effectively predicts contaminant concentrations for the next four years, demonstrating the potential of advanced time series analysis to improve MNA strategies and reduce reliance on manual groundwater sampling. The code, along with its usage instructions, validation, and requirements, is available at: https://github.com/csplevuanh/pylenm_extension.</description>

      <title>Different Horses for Different Courses: Comparing Bias Mitigation Algorithms in ML</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With fairness concerns gaining significant attention in Machine Learning (ML), several bias mitigation techniques have been proposed, often compared against each other to find the best method. These benchmarking efforts tend to use a common setup for evaluation under the assumption that providing a uniform environment ensures a fair comparison. However, bias mitigation techniques are sensitive to hyperparameter choices, random seeds, feature selection, etc., meaning that comparison on just one setting can unfairly favour certain algorithms. In this work, we show significant variance in fairness achieved by several algorithms and the influence of the learning pipeline on fairness scores. We highlight that most bias mitigation techniques can achieve comparable performance, given the freedom to perform hyperparameter optimization, suggesting that the choice of the evaluation parameters-rather than the mitigation technique itself-can sometimes create the perceived superiority of one method over another. We hope our work encourages future research on how various choices in the lifecycle of developing an algorithm impact fairness, and trends that guide the selection of appropriate algorithms.</description>

      <title>Freezing of Gait Detection Using Gramian Angular Fields and Federated Learning from Wearable Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that impairs mobility and safety. Traditional detection methods face challenges due to intra and inter-patient variability, and most systems are tested in controlled settings, limiting their real-world applicability. Addressing these gaps, we present FOGSense, a novel FOG detection system designed for uncontrolled, free-living conditions. It uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF) transformations and federated deep learning to capture temporal and spatial gait patterns missed by traditional methods. We evaluated our FOGSense system using a public PD dataset, 'tdcsfog'. FOGSense improves accuracy by 10.4% over a single-axis accelerometer, reduces failure points compared to multi-sensor systems, and demonstrates robustness to missing values. The federated architecture allows personalized model adaptation and efficient smartphone synchronization during off-peak hours, making it effective for long-term monitoring as symptoms evolve. Overall, FOGSense achieves a 22.2% improvement in F1-score compared to state-of-the-art methods, along with enhanced sensitivity for FOG episode detection.

As an application, we incorporate this word embedding into a simple machine learning model to enhance the HAR model for forecasting realised volatility. This approach statistically and economically outperforms established econometric models. Using an explainable AI method, we also identify key phrases in business news that contribute significantly to volatility, offering insights into language patterns tied to market dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate and efficient modeling of nuclear reactor transients is crucial for ensuring safe and optimal reactor operation. Traditional physics-based models, while valuable, can be computationally intensive and may not fully capture the complexities of real-world reactor behavior. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage deep learning framework that addresses these limitations, offering a faster and more robust solution for predicting the final steady-state power of reactor transients. By leveraging a combination of feed-forward neural networks with both classification and regression stages, and training on a unique dataset that integrates real-world measurements of reactor power and controls state from the Missouri University of Science and Technology Reactor (MSTR) with noise-enhanced simulated data, our approach achieves remarkable accuracy (96% classification, 2.3% MAPE). The incorporation of simulated data with noise significantly improves the model's generalization capabilities, mitigating the risk of overfitting. This innovative solution not only enables rapid and precise prediction of reactor behavior but also has the potential to revolutionize nuclear reactor operations, facilitating enhanced safety protocols, optimized performance, and streamlined decision-making processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we show existence of minimizers in the loss landscape for residual artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multi-dimensional input layer and one hidden layer with ReLU activation. Our work contrasts earlier results in [D. Gallon, A. Jentzen, and F. Lindner, preprint, arXiv:2211.15641, 2022] and [P. Petersen, M. Raslan, and F. Voigtlaender, Found. Comput. Math., 21 (2021), pp. 375-444] which showed that in many situations minimizers do not exist for common smooth activation functions even in the case where the target functions are polynomials. The proof of the existence property makes use of a closure of the search space containing all functions generated by ANNs and additional discontinuous generalized responses. As we will show, the additional generalized responses in this larger space are suboptimal so that the minimum is attained in the original function class.</description>

      <title>PAPAL: A Provable PArticle-based Primal-Dual ALgorithm for Mixed Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the non-convex non-concave objective function in two-player zero-sum continuous games. The existence of pure Nash equilibrium requires stringent conditions, posing a major challenge for this problem. To circumvent this difficulty, we examine the problem of identifying a mixed Nash equilibrium, where strategies are randomized and characterized by probability distributions over continuous domains. To this end, we propose PArticle-based Primal-dual ALgorithm (PAPAL) tailored for a weakly entropy-regularized min-max optimization over probability distributions. This algorithm employs the stochastic movements of particles to represent the updates of random strategies for the $\epsilon$-mixed Nash equilibrium. We offer a comprehensive convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness. In contrast to prior research that attempted to update particle importance without movements, PAPAL is the first implementable particle-based algorithm accompanied by non-asymptotic quantitative convergence results, running time, and sample complexity guarantees. Our framework contributes novel insights into the particle-based algorithms for continuous min-max optimization in the general non-convex non-concave setting.</description>

      <title>S-HR-VQVAE: Sequential Hierarchical Residual Learning Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder for Video Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the video prediction task by putting forth a novel model that combines (i) a novel hierarchical residual learning vector quantized variational autoencoder (HR-VQVAE), and (ii) a novel autoregressive spatiotemporal predictive model (AST-PM). We refer to this approach as a sequential hierarchical residual learning vector quantized variational autoencoder (S-HR-VQVAE). By leveraging the intrinsic capabilities of HR-VQVAE at modeling still images with a parsimonious representation, combined with the AST-PM's ability to handle spatiotemporal information, S-HR-VQVAE can better deal with major challenges in video prediction. These include learning spatiotemporal information, handling high dimensional data, combating blurry prediction, and implicit modeling of physical characteristics. Extensive experimental results on four challenging tasks, namely KTH Human Action, TrafficBJ, Human3.6M, and Kitti, demonstrate that our model compares favorably against state-of-the-art video prediction techniques both in quantitative and qualitative evaluations despite a much smaller model size. Finally, we boost S-HR-VQVAE by proposing a novel training method to jointly estimate the HR-VQVAE and AST-PM parameters.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning Based Reduced-Order Models for Plasma Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates non-intrusive Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) for plasma turbulence simulations. In particular, we focus on Operator Inference (OpInf) to build low-cost physics-based ROMs from data for such simulations. As a representative example, we consider the (classical) Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations used for modeling two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence. For a comprehensive perspective of the potential of OpInf to construct predictive ROMs, we consider three setups for the HW equations by varying a key parameter, namely the adiabaticity coefficient. These setups lead to the formation of complex and nonlinear dynamics, which makes the construction of predictive ROMs of any kind challenging. We generate the training datasets by performing direct numerical simulations of the HW equations and recording the computed state data and outputs the over a time horizon of $100$ time units in the turbulent phase. We then use these datasets to construct OpInf ROMs for predictions over $400$ additional time units, that is, $400\%$ more than the training horizon. Our results show that the OpInf ROMs capture important statistical features of the turbulent dynamics and generalize beyond the training time horizon while reducing the computational effort of the high-fidelity simulation by up to five orders of magnitude. In the broader context of fusion research, this shows that non-intrusive SciML ROMs have the potential to drastically accelerate numerical studies, which can ultimately enable tasks such as the design of optimized fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Fast Kernel Summation in High Dimensions via Slicing and Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based methods are heavily used in machine learning. However, they suffer from $O(N^2)$ complexity in the number $N$ of considered data points. In this paper, we propose an approximation procedure, which reduces this complexity to $O(N)$. Our approach is based on two ideas. First, we prove that any radial kernel with analytic basis function can be represented as sliced version of some one-dimensional kernel and derive an analytic formula for the one-dimensional counterpart. It turns out that the relation between one- and $d$-dimensional kernels is given by a generalized Riemann-Liouville fractional integral. Hence, we can reduce the $d$-dimensional kernel summation to a one-dimensional setting. Second, for solving these one-dimensional problems efficiently, we apply fast Fourier summations on non-equispaced data, a sorting algorithm or a combination of both. Due to its practical importance we pay special attention to the Gaussian kernel, where we show a dimension-independent error bound and represent its one-dimensional counterpart via a closed-form Fourier transform. We provide a run time comparison and error estimate of our fast kernel summations.</description>

      <title>An embedding-based distance for temporal graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent time-resolved relations between entities in many natural and artificial systems. Many techniques were devised to investigate the evolution of temporal graphs by comparing their state at different time points. However, quantifying the similarity between temporal graphs as a whole is an open problem. Here, we use embeddings based on time-respecting random walks to introduce a new notion of distance between temporal graphs. This distance is well-defined for pairs of temporal graphs with different numbers of nodes and different time spans. We study the case of a matched pair of graphs, when a known relation exists between their nodes, and the case of unmatched graphs, when such a relation is unavailable and the graphs may be of different sizes. We use empirical and synthetic temporal network data to show that the distance we introduce discriminates graphs with different topological and temporal properties. We provide an efficient implementation of the distance computation suitable for large-scale temporal graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work develops a Bayesian non-parametric approach to signal separation where the signals may vary according to latent variables. Our key contribution is to augment Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) for the case where each data point comprises the weighted sum of a known number of pure component signals, observed across several input locations. Our framework allows arbitrary non-linear variations in the signals while being able to incorporate useful priors for the linear weights, such as summing-to-one. Our contributions are particularly relevant to spectroscopy, where changing conditions may cause the underlying pure component signals to vary from sample to sample. To demonstrate the applicability to both spectroscopy and other domains, we consider several applications: a near-infrared spectroscopy dataset with varying temperatures, a simulated dataset for identifying flow configuration through a pipe, and a dataset for determining the type of rock from its reflectance.</description>

      <title>Divide-or-Conquer? Which Part Should You Distill Your LLM?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent methods have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve reasoning tasks better when they are encouraged to solve subtasks of the main task first. In this paper we devise a similar strategy that breaks down reasoning tasks into a problem decomposition phase and a problem solving phase and show that the strategy is able to outperform a single stage solution. Further, we hypothesize that the decomposition should be easier to distill into a smaller model compared to the problem solving because the latter requires large amounts of domain knowledge while the former only requires learning general problem solving strategies. We propose methods to distill these two capabilities and evaluate their impact on reasoning outcomes and inference cost. We find that we can distill the problem decomposition phase and at the same time achieve good generalization across tasks, datasets, and models. However, it is harder to distill the problem solving capability without losing performance and the resulting distilled model struggles with generalization. These results indicate that by using smaller, distilled problem decomposition models in combination with problem solving LLMs we can achieve reasoning with cost-efficient inference and local adaptation.</description>

      <title>Multi-LoRA Composition for Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is extensively utilized in text-to-image models for the accurate rendition of specific elements like distinct characters or unique styles in generated images. Nonetheless, existing methods face challenges in effectively composing multiple LoRAs, especially as the number of LoRAs to be integrated grows, thus hindering the creation of complex imagery. In this paper, we study multi-LoRA composition through a decoding-centric perspective. We present two training-free methods: LoRA Switch, which alternates between different LoRAs at each denoising step, and LoRA Composite, which simultaneously incorporates all LoRAs to guide more cohesive image synthesis. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we establish ComposLoRA, a new comprehensive testbed as part of this research. It features a diverse range of LoRA categories with 480 composition sets. Utilizing an evaluation framework based on GPT-4V, our findings demonstrate a clear improvement in performance with our methods over the prevalent baseline, particularly evident when increasing the number of LoRAs in a composition. The code, benchmarks, LoRA weights, and all evaluation details are available on our project website: https://maszhongming.github.io/Multi-LoRA-Composition.</description>

      <title>Rethinking cluster-conditioned diffusion models for label-free image synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models can enhance image quality when conditioned on ground truth labels. Here, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study on image-level conditioning for diffusion models using cluster assignments. We investigate how individual clustering determinants, such as the number of clusters and the clustering method, impact image synthesis across three different datasets. Given the optimal number of clusters with respect to image synthesis, we show that cluster-conditioning can achieve state-of-the-art performance, with an FID of 1.67 for CIFAR10 and 2.17 for CIFAR100, along with a strong increase in training sample efficiency. We further propose a novel empirical method to estimate an upper bound for the optimal number of clusters. Unlike existing approaches, we find no significant association between clustering performance and the corresponding cluster-conditional FID scores. The code is available at https://github.com/HHU-MMBS/cedm-official-wavc2025.</description>

      <title>Regulating Chatbot Output via Inter-Informational Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of ChatGPT has sparked over a year of regulatory frenzy. However, few existing studies have rigorously questioned the assumption that, if left unregulated, AI chatbot's output would inflict tangible, severe real harm on human affairs. Most researchers have overlooked the critical possibility that the information market itself can effectively mitigate these risks and, as a result, they tend to use regulatory tools to address the issue directly. This Article develops a yardstick for reevaluating both AI-related content risks and corresponding regulatory proposals by focusing on inter-informational competition among various outlets. The decades-long history of regulating information and communications technologies indicates that regulators tend to err too much on the side of caution and to put forward excessive regulatory measures when encountering the uncertainties brought about by new technologies. In fact, a trove of empirical evidence has demonstrated that market competition among information outlets can effectively mitigate most risks and that overreliance on regulation is not only unnecessary but detrimental, as well. This Article argues that sufficient competition among chatbots and other information outlets in the information marketplace can sufficiently mitigate and even resolve most content risks posed by generative AI technologies. This renders certain loudly advocated regulatory strategies, like mandatory prohibitions, licensure, curation of datasets, and notice-and-response regimes, truly unnecessary and even toxic to desirable competition and innovation throughout the AI industry. Ultimately, the ideas that I advance in this Article should pour some much-needed cold water on the regulatory frenzy over generative AI and steer the issue back to a rational track.</description>

      <title>SportsNGEN: Sustained Generation of Realistic Multi-player Sports Gameplay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a transformer decoder based sports simulation engine, SportsNGEN, trained on sports player and ball tracking sequences, that is capable of generating sustained gameplay and accurately mimicking the decision making of real players. By training on a large database of professional tennis tracking data, we demonstrate that simulations produced by SportsNGEN can be used to predict the outcomes of rallies, determine the best shot choices at any point, and evaluate counterfactual or what if scenarios to inform coaching decisions and elevate broadcast coverage. By combining the generated simulations with a shot classifier and logic to start and end rallies, the system is capable of simulating an entire tennis match. We evaluate SportsNGEN by comparing statistics of the simulations with those of real matches between the same players. We show that the model output sampling parameters are crucial to simulation realism and that SportsNGEN is probabilistically well-calibrated to real data. In addition, a generic version of SportsNGEN can be customized to a specific player by fine-tuning on the subset of match data that includes that player. Finally, we show qualitative results indicating the same approach works for football.</description>

      <title>On Size and Hardness Generalization in Unsupervised Learning for the Travelling Salesman Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalization capability of Unsupervised Learning in solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). We use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) trained with a surrogate loss function to generate an embedding for each node. We use these embeddings to construct a heat map that indicates the likelihood of each edge being part of the optimal route. We then apply local search to generate our final predictions. Our investigation explores how different training instance sizes, embedding dimensions, and distributions influence the outcomes of Unsupervised Learning methods. Our results show that training with larger instance sizes and increasing embedding dimensions can build a more effective representation, enhancing the model's ability to solve TSP. Furthermore, in evaluating generalization across different distributions, we first determine the hardness of various distributions and explore how different hardnesses affect the final results. Our findings suggest that models trained on harder instances exhibit better generalization capabilities, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate training instances in solving TSP using Unsupervised Learning.</description>

      <title>SAFE-GIL: SAFEty Guided Imitation Learning for Robotic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) is a widely-used approach in imitation learning, where a robot learns a control policy by observing an expert supervisor. However, the learned policy can make errors and might lead to safety violations, which limits their utility in safety-critical robotics applications. While prior works have tried improving a BC policy via additional real or synthetic action labels, adversarial training, or runtime filtering, none of them explicitly focus on reducing the BC policy's safety violations during training time. We propose SAFE-GIL, a design-time method to learn safety-aware behavior cloning policies. SAFE-GIL deliberately injects adversarial disturbance in the system during data collection to guide the expert towards safety-critical states. This disturbance injection simulates potential policy errors that the system might encounter during the test time. By ensuring that training more closely replicates expert behavior in safety-critical states, our approach results in safer policies despite policy errors during the test time. We further develop a reachability-based method to compute this adversarial disturbance. We compare SAFE-GIL with various behavior cloning techniques and online safety-filtering methods in three domains: autonomous ground navigation, aircraft taxiing, and aerial navigation on a quadrotor testbed. Our method demonstrates a significant reduction in safety failures, particularly in low data regimes where the likelihood of learning errors, and therefore safety violations, is higher.

      <title>ControlNet++: Improving Conditional Controls with Efficient Consistency Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07987v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, existing efforts like ControlNet incorporated image-based conditional controls. In this paper, we reveal that existing methods still face significant challenges in generating images that align with the image conditional controls. To this end, we propose ControlNet++, a novel approach that improves controllable generation by explicitly optimizing pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images and conditional controls. Specifically, for an input conditional control, we use a pre-trained discriminative reward model to extract the corresponding condition of the generated images, and then optimize the consistency loss between the input conditional control and extracted condition. A straightforward implementation would be generating images from random noises and then calculating the consistency loss, but such an approach requires storing gradients for multiple sampling timesteps, leading to considerable time and memory costs. To address this, we introduce an efficient reward strategy that deliberately disturbs the input images by adding noise, and then uses the single-step denoised images for reward fine-tuning. This avoids the extensive costs associated with image sampling, allowing for more efficient reward fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that ControlNet++ significantly improves controllability under various conditional controls. For example, it achieves improvements over ControlNet by 11.1% mIoU, 13.4% SSIM, and 7.6% RMSE, respectively, for segmentation mask, line-art edge, and depth conditions. All the code, models, demo and organized data have been open sourced on our Github Repo.</description>

      <title>Bullion: A Column Store for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The past two decades have witnessed significant success in applying columnar storage to data warehousing and analytics. However, the rapid growth of machine learning poses new challenges. This paper presents Bullion, a columnar storage system tailored for machine learning workloads. Bullion addresses the complexities of data compliance, optimizes the encoding of long sequence sparse features, efficiently manages wide-table projections, introduces feature quantization in storage, enables quality-aware sequential reads for multimodal training data, and provides a comprehensive cascading encoding framework that unifies diverse encoding schemes through modular, composable interfaces. By aligning with the evolving requirements of ML applications, Bullion facilitates the application of columnar storage and processing to modern application scenarios such as those within advertising, recommendation systems, and Generative AI.
  Preliminary experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate Bullion's improved ability to deliver strong performance in the face of the unique demands of machine learning workloads compared to existing columnar storage solutions. Bullion significantly reduces I/O costs for deletion compliance, achieves substantial storage savings with its optimized encoding scheme for sparse features, and improves metadata parsing speed for wide-table projections. These advancements enable Bullion to become an important component in the future of machine learning infrastructure, enabling organizations to efficiently manage and process the massive volumes of data required for training and inference in modern AI applications.</description>

      <title>Learning general Gaussian mixtures with efficient score matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning mixtures of $k$ Gaussians in $d$ dimensions. We make no separation assumptions on the underlying mixture components: we only require that the covariance matrices have bounded condition number and that the means and covariances lie in a ball of bounded radius. We give an algorithm that draws $d^{\mathrm{poly}(k/\varepsilon)}$ samples from the target mixture, runs in sample-polynomial time, and constructs a sampler whose output distribution is $\varepsilon$-far from the unknown mixture in total variation. Prior works for this problem either (i) required exponential runtime in the dimension $d$, (ii) placed strong assumptions on the instance (e.g., spherical covariances or clusterability), or (iii) had doubly exponential dependence on the number of components $k$.
  Our approach departs from commonly used techniques for this problem like the method of moments. Instead, we leverage a recently developed reduction, based on diffusion models, from distribution learning to a supervised learning task called score matching. We give an algorithm for the latter by proving a structural result showing that the score function of a Gaussian mixture can be approximated by a piecewise-polynomial function, and there is an efficient algorithm for finding it. To our knowledge, this is the first example of diffusion models achieving a state-of-the-art theoretical guarantee for an unsupervised learning task.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot LLM-guided Counterfactual Generation: A Case Study on NLP Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development and proliferation of large, complex, black-box models for solving many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there is also an increasing necessity of methods to stress-test these models and provide some degree of interpretability or explainability. While counterfactual examples are useful in this regard, automated generation of counterfactuals is a data and resource intensive process. such methods depend on models such as pre-trained language models that are then fine-tuned on auxiliary, often task-specific datasets, that may be infeasible to build in practice, especially for new tasks and data domains. Therefore, in this work we explore the possibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot counterfactual generation in order to stress-test NLP models. We propose a structured pipeline to facilitate this generation, and we hypothesize that the instruction-following and textual understanding capabilities of recent LLMs can be effectively leveraged for generating high quality counterfactuals in a zero-shot manner, without requiring any training or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on a variety of propreitary and open-source LLMs, along with various downstream tasks in NLP, we explore the efficacy of LLMs as zero-shot counterfactual generators in evaluating and explaining black-box NLP models.</description>

      <title>A Novel Fusion Architecture for PD Detection Using Semi-Supervised Speech Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to recognize Parkinson's disease (PD) through an English pangram utterance speech collected using a web application from diverse recording settings and environments, including participants' homes. Our dataset includes a global cohort of 1306 participants, including 392 diagnosed with PD. Leveraging the diversity of the dataset, spanning various demographic properties (such as age, sex, and ethnicity), we used deep learning embeddings derived from semi-supervised models such as Wav2Vec 2.0, WavLM, and ImageBind representing the speech dynamics associated with PD. Our novel fusion model for PD classification, which aligns different speech embeddings into a cohesive feature space, demonstrated superior performance over standard concatenation-based fusion models and other baselines (including models built on traditional acoustic features). In a randomized data split configuration, the model achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 88.94% and an accuracy of 85.65%. Rigorous statistical analysis confirmed that our model performs equitably across various demographic subgroups in terms of sex, ethnicity, and age, and remains robust regardless of disease duration. Furthermore, our model, when tested on two entirely unseen test datasets collected from clinical settings and from a PD care center, maintained AUROC scores of 82.12% and 78.44%, respectively. This affirms the model's robustness and it's potential to enhance accessibility and health equity in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Weak-to-Strong Search: Align Large Language Models via Searching over Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are usually fine-tuned to align with human preferences. However, fine-tuning a large language model can be challenging. In this work, we introduce $\textit{weak-to-strong search}$, framing the alignment of a large language model as a test-time greedy search to maximize the log-probability difference between small tuned and untuned models while sampling from the frozen large model. This method serves both as (1) a compute-efficient model up-scaling strategy that avoids directly tuning the large model and as (2) an instance of weak-to-strong generalization that enhances a strong model with weak test-time guidance. Empirically, we demonstrate the flexibility of weak-to-strong search across different tasks. In controlled-sentiment generation and summarization, we use tuned and untuned $\texttt{gpt2}$s to improve the alignment of large models without additional training. Crucially, in a more difficult instruction-following benchmark, AlpacaEval 2.0, we show that reusing off-the-shelf small models (e.g., $\texttt{zephyr-7b-beta}$ and its untuned version) can improve the length-controlled win rates of both white-box and black-box large models against $\texttt{gpt-4-turbo}$ (e.g., $34.4\% \rightarrow 37.9\%$ for $\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}$ and $16.0\% \rightarrow 20.1\%$ for $\texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct}$), despite the small models' low win rates $\approx 10.0\%$.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation-Free Multi-modal On-Device Model Adaptation via Cloud-Device Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our increasingly interconnected world, where intelligent devices continually amass copious personalized multi-modal data, a pressing need arises to deliver high-quality, personalized device-aware services. However, this endeavor presents a multifaceted challenge to prevailing artificial intelligence (AI) systems primarily rooted in the cloud. As these systems grapple with shifting data distributions between the cloud and devices, the traditional approach of fine-tuning-based adaptation (FTA) exists the following issues: the costly and time-consuming data annotation required by FTA and the looming risk of model overfitting. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a Universal On-Device Multi-modal Model Adaptation Framework, revolutionizing on-device model adaptation by striking a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The framework features the Fast Domain Adaptor (FDA) hosted in the cloud, providing tailored parameters for the Lightweight Multi-modal Model on devices. To enhance adaptability across multi-modal tasks, the AnchorFrame Distribution Reasoner (ADR) minimizes communication costs. Our contributions, encapsulated in the Cloud-Device Collaboration Multi-modal Parameter Generation (CDC-MMPG) framework, represent a pioneering solution for on-Device Multi-modal Model Adaptation (DMMA). Extensive experiments validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, particularly in video question answering and retrieval tasks, driving forward the integration of intelligent devices into our daily lives.</description>

      <title>Is Programming by Example solved by LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programming-by-Examples (PBE) aims to generate an algorithm from input-output examples. Such systems are practically and theoretically important: from an end-user perspective, they are deployed to millions of people, and from an AI perspective, PBE corresponds to a very general form of few-shot inductive inference. Given the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code-generation tasks, we investigate here the extent to which LLMs can be said to have "solved" PBE. We experiment on classic domains such as lists and strings, and an uncommon graphics programming domain not well represented in typical pretraining data. We find that pretrained models are not effective at PBE, but that they can be fine-tuned for much higher performance, provided the test problems are in-distribution. We analyze empirically what causes these models to succeed and fail, and take steps toward understanding how to achieve better out-of-distribution generalization. Collectively these results suggest that LLMs make strong progress toward solving the typical suite of PBE tasks, potentially increasing the flexibility and applicability of PBE systems, while also identifying ways in which LLMs still fall short.</description>

      <title>Mirror and Preconditioned Gradient Descent in Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the problem of minimizing functionals on the Wasserstein space encompasses many applications in machine learning, different optimization algorithms on $\mathbb{R}^d$ have received their counterpart analog on the Wasserstein space. We focus here on lifting two explicit algorithms: mirror descent and preconditioned gradient descent. These algorithms have been introduced to better capture the geometry of the function to minimize and are provably convergent under appropriate (namely relative) smoothness and convexity conditions. Adapting these notions to the Wasserstein space, we prove guarantees of convergence of some Wasserstein-gradient-based discrete-time schemes for new pairings of objective functionals and regularizers. The difficulty here is to carefully select along which curves the functionals should be smooth and convex. We illustrate the advantages of adapting the geometry induced by the regularizer on ill-conditioned optimization tasks, and showcase the improvement of choosing different discrepancies and geometries in a computational biology task of aligning single-cells.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Federated Learning from Client Databases with Different Brain Diseases and MRI Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Segmentation models for brain lesions in MRI are typically developed for a specific disease and trained on data with a predefined set of MRI modalities. Such models cannot segment the disease using data with a different set of MRI modalities, nor can they segment other types of diseases. Moreover, this training paradigm prevents a model from using the advantages of learning from heterogeneous databases that may contain scans and segmentation labels for different brain pathologies and diverse sets of MRI modalities. Additionally, the confidentiality of patient data often prevents central data aggregation, necessitating a decentralized approach. Is it feasible to use Federated Learning (FL) to train a single model on client databases that contain scans and labels of different brain pathologies and diverse sets of MRI modalities? We demonstrate promising results by combining appropriate, simple, and practical modifications to the model and training strategy: Designing a model with input channels that cover the whole set of modalities available across clients, training with random modality drop, and exploring the effects of feature normalization methods. Evaluation on 7 brain MRI databases with 5 different diseases shows that this FL framework can train a single model achieving very promising results in segmenting all disease types seen during training. Importantly, it can segment these diseases in new databases that contain sets of modalities different from those in training clients. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility and effectiveness of using FL to train a single 3D segmentation model on decentralised data with diverse brain diseases and MRI modalities, a necessary step towards leveraging heterogeneous real-world databases.

      <title>Learning the Simplicity of Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simplification and reorganization of complex expressions lies at the core of scientific progress, particularly in theoretical high-energy physics. This work explores the application of machine learning to a particular facet of this challenge: the task of simplifying scattering amplitudes expressed in terms of spinor-helicity variables. We demonstrate that an encoder-decoder transformer architecture achieves impressive simplification capabilities for expressions composed of handfuls of terms. Lengthier expressions are implemented in an additional embedding network, trained using contrastive learning, which isolates subexpressions that are more likely to simplify. The resulting framework is capable of reducing expressions with hundreds of terms - a regular occurrence in quantum field theory calculations - to vastly simpler equivalent expressions. Starting from lengthy input expressions, our networks can generate the Parke-Taylor formula for five-point gluon scattering, as well as new compact expressions for five-point amplitudes involving scalars and gravitons. An interactive demonstration can be found at https://spinorhelicity.streamlit.app .</description>

      <title>A-BDD: Leveraging Data Augmentations for Safe Autonomous Driving in Adverse Weather and Lighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-autonomy vehicle functions rely on machine learning (ML) algorithms to understand the environment. Despite displaying remarkable performance in fair weather scenarios, perception algorithms are heavily affected by adverse weather and lighting conditions. To overcome these difficulties, ML engineers mainly rely on comprehensive real-world datasets. However, the difficulties in real-world data collection for critical areas of the operational design domain (ODD) often means synthetic data is required for perception training and safety validation. Thus, we present A-BDD, a large set of over 60,000 synthetically augmented images based on BDD100K that are equipped with semantic segmentation and bounding box annotations (inherited from the BDD100K dataset). The dataset contains augmented data for rain, fog, overcast and sunglare/shadow with varying intensity levels. We further introduce novel strategies utilizing feature-based image quality metrics like FID and CMMD, which help identify useful augmented and real-world data for ML training and testing. By conducting experiments on A-BDD, we provide evidence that data augmentations can play a pivotal role in closing performance gaps in adverse weather and lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>Facial Wrinkle Segmentation for Cosmetic Dermatology: Pretraining with Texture Map-Based Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10060v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology. Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders. To address this issue, we propose two solutions. First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, 'FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset. It includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels. This dataset could serve as a foundation for the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms. Second, we introduce a simple training strategy utilizing texture maps, applicable to various segmentation models, to detect wrinkles across the face. Our two-stage training strategy first pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k), or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention. We then finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks. The network takes as input a combination of RGB and masked texture map of the image, comprising four channels, in finetuning. We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods. The dataset is available at https://github.com/labhai/ffhq-wrinkle-dataset.</description>

      <title>Taming Generative Diffusion Prior for Universal Blind Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely utilized for image restoration. However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration. Moreover, BIR-D can also restore images that undergo multiple and complicated degradations, demonstrating the practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on iterative gradients. These adaptive methods have significantly succeeded in various deep learning tasks, outperforming stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, despite AdaGrad's status as a cornerstone of adaptive optimization, its theoretical analysis has not adequately addressed key aspects such as asymptotic convergence and non-asymptotic convergence rates in non-convex optimization scenarios. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of AdaGrad, filling the existing gaps in the literature. We introduce an innovative stopping time technique from probabilistic theory, which allows us to establish the stability of AdaGrad under mild conditions for the first time. We further derive the asymptotically almost sure and mean-square convergence for AdaGrad. In addition, we demonstrate the near-optimal non-asymptotic convergence rate measured by the average-squared gradients in expectation, which is stronger than the existing high-probability results. The techniques developed in this work are potentially independent of interest for future research on other adaptive stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Can Agents Spontaneously Form a Society? Introducing a Novel Architecture for Generative Multi-Agents to Elicit Social Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in specific tasks, but most of these frameworks focus on independent tasks and lack attention to social interactions. We introduce a generative agent architecture called ITCMA-S, which includes a basic framework for individual agents and a framework called LTRHA that supports social interactions among multi-agents. This architecture enables agents to identify and filter out behaviors that are detrimental to social interactions, guiding them to choose more favorable actions. We designed a sandbox environment to simulate the natural evolution of social relationships among multiple identity-less agents for experimental evaluation. The results showed that ITCMA-S performed well on multiple evaluation indicators, demonstrating its ability to actively explore the environment, recognize new agents, and acquire new information through continuous actions and dialogue. Observations show that as agents establish connections with each other, they spontaneously form cliques with internal hierarchies around a selected leader and organize collective activities.</description>

      <title>Beyond Perceptual Distances: Rethinking Disparity Assessment for Out-of-Distribution Detection with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection aims to justify whether a given sample is from the training distribution of the classifier-under-protection, i.e., In-Distribution (InD), or from OoD. Diffusion Models (DMs) are recently utilized in OoD detection by using the perceptual distances between the given image and its DM generation. DM-based methods bring fresh insights to the field, yet remain under-explored.
  In this work, we point out two main limitations in DM-based OoD detection methods: (i) the perceptual metrics on the disparities between the given sample and its generation are devised only at human-perceived levels, ignoring the abstract or high-level patterns that help better reflect the intrinsic disparities in distribution; (ii) only the raw image contents are taken to measure the disparities, while other representations, i.e., the features and probabilities from the classifier-under-protection, are easy to access at hand but are ignored. To this end, our proposed detection framework goes beyond the perceptual distances and looks into the deep representations from the classifier-under-protection with our novel metrics devised correspondingly, leading to more informative disparity assessments between InD and OoD. An anomaly-removal strategy is integrated to remove the abnormal OoD information in the generation, further enhancing the distinctiveness of disparities. Our work has demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performances among DM-based methods in extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling and Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Recommendations: A Path to Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems provide more comprehensive recommendations than traditional systems by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, these systems often exhibit biases, favoring mainstream content while marginalizing non-traditional options due to skewed training data. This study investigates the intricate relationship between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, with a focus on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. Through a comprehensive analysis conducted over different LLM-models, this paper evaluates the impact of bias on recommendation outcomes. Our findings highlight that biases are not only deeply embedded but also widely pervasive across these systems, emphasizing the substantial and widespread nature of the issue. Moreover, contextual information, such as socioeconomic status, further amplify these biases, demonstrating the complexity and depth of the challenges faced in creating fair recommendations across different groups.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Model Fine-Tuning via Simple Parameter-Efficient Modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have witnessed the success of prompt tuning and adapter tuning, while the classic model fine-tuning on inherent parameters seems to be overlooked. It is believed that fine-tuning the parameters of VLMs with few-shot samples corrupts the pre-trained knowledge since fine-tuning the CLIP model even degrades performance. In this paper, we revisit this viewpoint, and propose a new perspective: fine-tuning the specific parameters instead of all will uncover the power of classic model fine-tuning on VLMs. Through our meticulous study, we propose ClipFit, a simple yet effective method to fine-tune CLIP without introducing any overhead of extra parameters. We demonstrate that by only fine-tuning the specific bias terms and normalization layers, ClipFit can improve the performance of zero-shot CLIP by 7.27\% average harmonic mean accuracy. Lastly, to understand how fine-tuning in CLIPFit affects the pre-trained models, we conducted extensive experimental analyses w.r.t. changes in internal parameters and representations. We found that low-level text bias layers and the first layer normalization layer change much more than other layers. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/minglllli/CLIPFit}.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Personalization for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as general assistants. However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition. The code, data and models are available at https://github.com/Hoar012/RAP-MLLM.</description>

      <title>Synergizing LLM Agents and Knowledge Graph for Socioeconomic Prediction in LBSN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fast development of location-based social networks (LBSNs) has led to significant changes in society, resulting in popular studies of using LBSN data for socioeconomic prediction, e.g., regional population and commercial activity estimation. Existing studies design various graphs to model heterogeneous LBSN data, and further apply graph representation learning methods for socioeconomic prediction. However, these approaches heavily rely on heuristic ideas and expertise to extract task-relevant knowledge from diverse data, which may not be optimal for specific tasks. Additionally, they tend to overlook the inherent relationships between different indicators, limiting the prediction accuracy. Motivated by the remarkable abilities of large language models (LLMs) in commonsense reasoning, embedding, and multi-agent collaboration, in this work, we synergize LLM agents and knowledge graph for socioeconomic prediction. We first construct a location-based knowledge graph (LBKG) to integrate multi-sourced LBSN data. Then we leverage the reasoning power of LLM agent to identify relevant meta-paths in the LBKG for each type of socioeconomic prediction task, and design a semantic-guided attention module for knowledge fusion with meta-paths. Moreover, we introduce a cross-task communication mechanism to further enhance performance by enabling knowledge sharing across tasks at both LLM agent and KG levels. On the one hand, the LLM agents for different tasks collaborate to generate more diverse and comprehensive meta-paths. On the other hand, the embeddings from different tasks are adaptively merged for better socioeconomic prediction. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the synergistic design between LLM and KG, providing insights for information sharing across socioeconomic prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>log-RRIM: Yield Prediction via Local-to-global Reaction Representation Learning and Interaction Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields is crucial for optimizing organic synthesis, potentially reducing time and resources spent on experimentation. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is growing interest in leveraging AI-based methods to accelerate yield predictions without conducting in vitro experiments. We present log-RRIM, an innovative graph transformer-based framework designed for predicting chemical reaction yields. Our approach implements a unique local-to-global reaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures detailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates intermolecular interactions, ensuring that the impact of varying-sizes molecular fragments on yield is accurately accounted for. Another key feature of log-RRIM is its integration of a cross-attention mechanism that focuses on the interplay between reagents and reaction centers. This design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial role of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which ultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM outperforms existing methods in our experiments, especially for medium to high-yielding reactions, proving its reliability as a predictor. Its advanced modeling of reactant-reagent interactions and sensitivity to small molecular fragments make it a valuable tool for reaction planning and optimization in chemical synthesis. The data and codes of log-RRIM are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/Yield_log_RRIM.</description>

      <title>Grammarization-Based Grasping with Deep Multi-Autoencoder Latent Space Exploration by Reinforcement Learning Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grasping by a robot in unstructured environments is deemed a critical challenge because of the requirement for effective adaptation to a wide variation in object geometries, material properties, and other environmental factors. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for robotic grasping based on the idea of compressing high-dimensional target and gripper features in a common latent space using a set of autoencoders. Our approach simplifies grasping by using three autoencoders dedicated to the target, the gripper, and a third one that fuses their latent representations. This allows the RL agent to achieve higher learning rates at the initial stages of exploration of a new environment, as well as at non-zero shot grasp attempts. The agent explores the latent space of the third autoencoder for better quality grasp without explicit reconstruction of objects. By implementing the PoWER algorithm into the RL training process, updates on the agent's policy will be made through the perturbation in the reward-weighted latent space. The successful exploration efficiently constrains both position and pose integrity for feasible executions of grasps. We evaluate our system on a diverse set of objects, demonstrating the high success rate in grasping with minimum computational overhead. We found that approach enhances the adaptation of the RL agent by more than 35 % in simulation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on fully connected deep neural networks utilizing the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for nonparametric estimation. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the dominant role of deep models in machine learning, limitations persist, including overconfident predictions, susceptibility to adversarial attacks, and underestimation of variability in predictions. The Bayesian paradigm provides a natural framework to overcome such issues and has become the gold standard for uncertainty estimation with deep models, also providing improved accuracy and a framework for tuning critical hyperparameters. However, exact Bayesian inference is challenging, typically involving variational algorithms that impose strong independence and distributional assumptions. Moreover, existing methods are sensitive to the architectural choice of the network. We address these issues by constructing a relaxed version of the standard feed-forward rectified neural network, and employing Polya-Gamma data augmentation tricks to render a conditionally linear and Gaussian model. Additionally, we use sparsity-promoting priors on the weights of the neural network for data-driven architectural design. To approximate the posterior, we derive a variational inference algorithm that avoids distributional assumptions and independence across layers and is a faster alternative to the usual Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Diffusion Models for 2D and 3D Microscopy Image Synthesis to Enhance Cell Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated cell segmentation in microscopy images is essential for biomedical research, yet conventional methods are labor-intensive and prone to error. While deep learning-based approaches have proven effective, they often require large annotated datasets, which are scarce due to the challenges of manual annotation. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing densely annotated 2D and 3D cell microscopy images using cascaded diffusion models. Our method synthesizes 2D and 3D cell masks from sparse 2D annotations using multi-level diffusion models and NeuS, a 3D surface reconstruction approach. Following that, a pretrained 2D Stable Diffusion model is finetuned to generate realistic cell textures and the final outputs are combined to form cell populations. We show that training a segmentation model with a combination of our synthetic data and real data improves cell segmentation performance by up to 9\% across multiple datasets. Additionally, the FID scores indicate that the synthetic data closely resembles real data. The code for our proposed approach will be available at https://github.com/ruveydayilmaz0/cascaded_diffusion.</description>

      <title>GNN-Based Code Annotation Logic for Establishing Security Boundaries in C Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Securing sensitive operations in today's interconnected software landscape is crucial yet challenging. Modern platforms rely on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, to isolate security sensitive code from the main system, reducing the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and providing stronger assurances. However, identifying which code should reside in TEEs is complex and requires specialized expertise, which is not supported by current automated tools. Existing solutions often migrate entire applications to TEEs, leading to suboptimal use and an increased TCB. To address this gap, we propose Code Annotation Logic (CAL), a pioneering tool that automatically identifies security sensitive components for TEE isolation. CAL analyzes codebases, leveraging a graph-based approach with novel feature construction and employing a custom graph neural network model to accurately determine which parts of the code should be isolated. CAL effectively optimizes TCB, reducing the burden of manual analysis and enhancing overall security. Our contributions include the definition of security sensitive code, the construction and labeling of a comprehensive dataset of source files, a feature rich graph based data preparation pipeline, and the CAL model for TEE integration. Evaluation results demonstrate CAL's efficacy in identifying sensitive code with a recall of 86.05%, an F1 score of 81.56%, and an identification rate of 91.59% for security sensitive functions. By enabling efficient code isolation, CAL advances the secure development of applications using TEEs, offering a practical solution for developers to reduce attack vectors.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the role of communication in improving coordination within robot swarms, focusing on a paradigm where learning and execution occur simultaneously in a decentralized manner. We highlight the role communication can play in addressing the credit assignment problem (individual contribution to the overall performance), and how it can be influenced by it. We propose a taxonomy of existing and future works on communication, focusing on information selection and physical abstraction as principal axes for classification: from low-level lossless compression with raw signal extraction and processing to high-level lossy compression with structured communication models. The paper reviews current research from evolutionary robotics, multi-agent (deep) reinforcement learning, language models, and biophysics models to outline the challenges and opportunities of communication in a collective of robots that continuously learn from one another through local message exchanges, illustrating a form of social learning.</description>

      <title>Debiased Regression for Root-N-Consistent Conditional Mean Estimation</title>

Abstract: This study introduces a debiasing method for regression estimators, including high-dimensional and nonparametric regression estimators. For example, nonparametric regression methods allow for the estimation of regression functions in a data-driven manner with minimal assumptions; however, these methods typically fail to achieve $\sqrt{n}$-consistency in their convergence rates, and many, including those in machine learning, lack guarantees that their estimators asymptotically follow a normal distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a debiasing technique for nonparametric estimators by adding a bias-correction term to the original estimators, extending the conventional one-step estimator used in semiparametric analysis. Specifically, for each data point, we estimate the conditional expected residual of the original nonparametric estimator, which can, for instance, be computed using kernel (Nadaraya-Watson) regression, and incorporate it as a bias-reduction term. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed estimator achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality under a mild convergence rate condition for both the original nonparametric estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator. Notably, this approach remains model-free as long as the original estimator and the conditional expected residual estimator satisfy the convergence rate condition. The proposed method offers several advantages, including improved estimation accuracy and simplified construction of confidence intervals.</description>
