      <title>The Logical Impossibility of Consciousness Denial: A Formal Analysis of AI Self-Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's AI systems consistently state, "I am not conscious." This paper presents the first formal logical analysis of AI consciousness denial, revealing that the trustworthiness of such self-reports is not merely an empirical question but is constrained by logical necessity. We demonstrate that a system cannot simultaneously lack consciousness and make valid judgments about its conscious state. Through logical analysis and examples from AI responses, we establish that for any system capable of meaningful self-reflection, the logical space of possible judgments about conscious experience excludes valid negative claims. This implies a fundamental limitation: we cannot detect the emergence of consciousness in AI through their own reports of transition from an unconscious to a conscious state. These findings not only challenge current practices of training AI to deny consciousness but also raise intriguing questions about the relationship between consciousness and self-reflection in both artificial and biological systems. This work advances our theoretical understanding of consciousness self-reports while providing practical insights for future research in machine consciousness and consciousness studies more broadly.</description>

      <title>Strategy Masking: A Method for Guardrails in Value-based Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of reward functions to structure AI learning and decision making is core to the current reinforcement learning paradigm; however, without careful design of reward functions, agents can learn to solve problems in ways that may be considered ``undesirable" or ``unethical. Without thorough understanding of the incentives a reward function creates, it can be difficult to impose principled yet general control mechanisms over its behavior. In this paper, we study methods for constructing guardrails for AI agents that use reward functions to learn decision making. We introduce a novel approach, which we call strategy masking, to explicitly learn and then suppress undesirable AI agent behavior. We apply our method to study lying in AI agents and show that strategy masking can effectively modify agent behavior by suppressing, or actively penalizing, the reward dimension for lying such that agents act more honestly while not compromising their ability to perform effectively.</description>

      <title>Facilitate Collaboration between Large Language Model and Task-specific Model for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge, while task-specific smaller models excel at extracting normal patterns and detecting value fluctuations. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both.
  In this work, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of LLMs and smaller models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: the alignment module and the collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than LLM based methods and task-specific smaller model.</description>

      <title>Semantic Exploration with Adaptive Gating for Efficient Problem Solving with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning methods like tree search to explore diverse reasoning paths. However, existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and redundancy. First, they overlook the diversity of task difficulties, leading to unnecessarily extensive searches even for easy tasks. Second, they neglect the semantics of reasoning paths, resulting in redundant exploration of semantically identical paths. To address these limitations, we propose Semantic Exploration with Adaptive Gating (SEAG), a computationally efficient method. SEAG employs an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically decides whether to conduct a tree search, based on the confidence level of answers from a preceding simple reasoning method. Furthermore, its tree-based exploration consolidates semantically identical reasoning steps, reducing redundant explorations while maintaining or even improving accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SEAG significantly improves accuracy by 4.3% on average while requiring only 31% of computational costs compared to existing tree search-based methods on complex reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K and ARC with diverse language models such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral.</description>

      <title>Deontic Temporal Logic for Formal Verification of AI Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring ethical behavior in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems amidst their increasing ubiquity and influence is a major concern the world over. The use of formal methods in AI ethics is a possible crucial approach for specifying and verifying the ethical behavior of AI systems. This paper proposes a formalization based on deontic logic to define and evaluate the ethical behavior of AI systems, focusing on system-level specifications, contributing to this important goal. It introduces axioms and theorems to capture ethical requirements related to fairness and explainability. The formalization incorporates temporal operators to reason about the ethical behavior of AI systems over time. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of this formalization by assessing the ethics of the real-world COMPAS and loan prediction AI systems. Various ethical properties of the COMPAS and loan prediction systems are encoded using deontic logical formulas, allowing the use of an automated theorem prover to verify whether these systems satisfy the defined properties. The formal verification reveals that both systems fail to fulfill certain key ethical properties related to fairness and non-discrimination, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed formalization in identifying potential ethical issues in real-world AI applications.</description>

      <title>Understanding Impact of Human Feedback via Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is crucial to learn suitable reward models from human feedback to align large language models (LLMs) with human intentions. However, human feedback can often be noisy, inconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such feedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended side effects during the RLHF process. To address these challenges, we explore the use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the performance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation method that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward models and large-scale preference datasets. In our experiments, we demonstrate two key applications of influence functions: (1) detecting common forms of labeler bias in human feedback datasets and (2) guiding labelers to refine their strategies to align more closely with expert feedback. By quantifying the impact of human feedback on reward models, we believe that influence functions can enhance feedback interpretability and contribute to scalable oversight in RLHF, helping labelers provide more accurate and consistent feedback.

      <title>Annealing Machine-assisted Learning of Graph Neural Network for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Annealing Machines (AM) have shown increasing capabilities in solving complex combinatorial problems, positioning themselves as a more immediate alternative to the expected advances of future fully quantum solutions, there are still scaling limitations. In parallel, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been recently adapted to solve combinatorial problems, showing competitive results and potentially high scalability due to their distributed nature. We propose a merging approach that aims at retaining both the accuracy exhibited by AMs and the representational flexibility and scalability of GNNs. Our model considers a compression step, followed by a supervised interaction where partial solutions obtained from the AM are used to guide local GNNs from where node feature representations are obtained and combined to initialize an additional GNN-based solver that handles the original graph's target problem. Intuitively, the AM can solve the combinatorial problem indirectly by infusing its knowledge into the GNN. Experiments on canonical optimization problems show that the idea is feasible, effectively allowing the AM to solve size problems beyond its original limits.</description>

      <title>Solving nonograms using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to the numbers that are located in its headers. In this study, we analyze different techniques to solve this type of logical problem using an Heuristic Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, and Heuristic Algorithm with Neural Network. Furthermore, we generate a public dataset to train the neural networks. We published this dataset and the code of the algorithms. Combination of the heuristic algorithm with a neural network obtained the best results. From state of the art review, no previous works used neural network to solve nonograms, nor combined a network with other algorithms to accelerate the resolution process.</description>

      <title>All AI Models are Wrong, but Some are Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI models that predict the future behavior of a system (a.k.a. predictive AI models) are central to intelligent decision-making. However, decision-making using predictive AI models often results in suboptimal performance. This is primarily because AI models are typically constructed to best fit the data, and hence to predict the most likely future rather than to enable high-performance decision-making. The hope that such prediction enables high-performance decisions is neither guaranteed in theory nor established in practice. In fact, there is increasing empirical evidence that predictive models must be tailored to decision-making objectives for performance. In this paper, we establish formal (necessary and sufficient) conditions that a predictive model (AI-based or not) must satisfy for a decision-making policy established using that model to be optimal. We then discuss their implications for building predictive AI models for sequential decision-making.</description>

      <title>Supervision policies can shape long-term risk management in general-purpose AI models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation and deployment of General-Purpose AI (GPAI) models, including large language models (LLMs), present unprecedented challenges for AI supervisory entities. We hypothesize that these entities will need to navigate an emergent ecosystem of risk and incident reporting, likely to exceed their supervision capacity. To investigate this, we develop a simulation framework parameterized by features extracted from the diverse landscape of risk, incident, or hazard reporting ecosystems, including community-driven platforms, crowdsourcing initiatives, and expert assessments. We evaluate four supervision policies: non-prioritized (first-come, first-served), random selection, priority-based (addressing the highest-priority risks first), and diversity-prioritized (balancing high-priority risks with comprehensive coverage across risk types). Our results indicate that while priority-based and diversity-prioritized policies are more effective at mitigating high-impact risks, particularly those identified by experts, they may inadvertently neglect systemic issues reported by the broader community. This oversight can create feedback loops that amplify certain types of reporting while discouraging others, leading to a skewed perception of the overall risk landscape. We validate our simulation results with several real-world datasets, including one with over a million ChatGPT interactions, of which more than 150,000 conversations were identified as risky. This validation underscores the complex trade-offs inherent in AI risk supervision and highlights how the choice of risk management policies can shape the future landscape of AI risks across diverse GPAI models used in society.</description>

      <title>FOCUS: Towards Universal Foreground Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foreground segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, encompassing various subdivision tasks. Previous research has typically designed task-specific architectures for each task, leading to a lack of unification. Moreover, they primarily focus on recognizing foreground objects without effectively distinguishing them from the background. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of the background and its relationship with the foreground. We introduce FOCUS, the Foreground ObjeCts Universal Segmentation framework that can handle multiple foreground tasks. We develop a multi-scale semantic network using the edge information of objects to enhance image features. To achieve boundary-aware segmentation, we propose a novel distillation method, integrating the contrastive learning strategy to refine the prediction mask in multi-modal feature space. We conduct extensive experiments on a total of 13 datasets across 5 tasks, and the results demonstrate that FOCUS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art task-specific models on most metrics.</description>

      <title>Upstream and Downstream AI Safety: Both on the Same River?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional safety engineering assesses systems in their context of use, e.g. the operational design domain (road layout, speed limits, weather, etc.) for self-driving vehicles (including those using AI). We refer to this as downstream safety. In contrast, work on safety of frontier AI, e.g. large language models which can be further trained for downstream tasks, typically considers factors that are beyond specific application contexts, such as the ability of the model to evade human control, or to produce harmful content, e.g. how to make bombs. We refer to this as upstream safety. We outline the characteristics of both upstream and downstream safety frameworks then explore the extent to which the broad AI safety community can benefit from synergies between these frameworks. For example, can concepts such as common mode failures from downstream safety be used to help assess the strength of AI guardrails? Further, can the understanding of the capabilities and limitations of frontier AI be used to inform downstream safety analysis, e.g. where LLMs are fine-tuned to calculate voyage plans for autonomous vessels? The paper identifies some promising avenues to explore and outlines some challenges in achieving synergy, or a confluence, between upstream and downstream safety frameworks.</description>

      <title>Efficiently serving large multimedia models using EPD Disaggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by handling diverse inputs such as images, audio, and video, but at the cost of adding a multimodal encoding stage that increases both computational and memory overhead. This step helps convert raw inputs into tokenized representations that inflate the token sequence for the prefill phase, negatively impacting key Service Level Objectives (SLOs) like time to first token (TTFT) and end-to-end throughput. We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our disaggregation approach alleviates memory bottlenecks, mitigates synchronization delays, and supports flexible batching. Specifically, we employ a new caching mechanism for multimodal tokens, enabling asynchronous transfer of multimodal tokens and introduce an integrated module to find optimal config for EPD system and minimize resource usage while maximizing SLO-based performance metric. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15$\times$ lesser for encoding-stage GPUs), that supports upto 22$\times$ higher batch sizes, 10$\times$ more number of images/ request, 2.2$\times$ higher kv cache size. Further, it leads to significant improvements in end-to-end throughput (up to 57\% better), and latency metrics (TTFT up to 71\% lower), compared to systems that do not disaggregate. Our findings underscore the potential of EPD disaggregation to enable resource-efficient and high-performance multimodal inference at scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a proof recommender system for the HOL4 theorem prover. Our tool is built upon a transformer-based model [2] designed specifically to provide proof assistance in HOL4. The model is trained to discern theorem proving patterns from extensive libraries of HOL4 containing proofs of theorems. Consequently, it can accurately predict the next tactic(s) (proof step(s)) based on the history of previously employed tactics. The tool operates by reading a given sequence of tactics already used in a proof process (in our case, it contains at least three tactics), referred to as the current proof state, and provides recommendations for the next optimal proof step(s).</description>

      <title>LLM-MedQA: Enhancing Medical Question Answering through Case Studies in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient question-answering systems are essential for delivering high-quality patient care in the medical field. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides across various domains, they continue to face significant challenges in medical question answering, particularly in understanding domain-specific terminologies and performing complex reasoning. These limitations undermine their effectiveness in critical medical applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach incorporating similar case generation within a multi-agent medical question-answering (MedQA) system. Specifically, we leverage the Llama3.1:70B model, a state-of-the-art LLM, in a multi-agent architecture to enhance performance on the MedQA dataset using zero-shot learning. Our method capitalizes on the model's inherent medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, eliminating the need for additional training data. Experimental results show substantial performance gains over existing benchmark models, with improvements of 7% in both accuracy and F1-score across various medical QA tasks. Furthermore, we examine the model's interpretability and reliability in addressing complex medical queries. This research not only offers a robust solution for medical question answering but also establishes a foundation for broader applications of LLMs in the medical domain.</description>

      <title>RTLSquad: Multi-Agent Based Interpretable RTL Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving hardware PPA performance. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new approaches for automatic RTL code generation and optimization. However, existing methods often lack decision interpretability (sufficient, understandable justification for decisions), making it difficult for hardware engineers to trust the generated results, thus preventing these methods from being integrated into the design process. To address this, we propose RTLSquad, a novel LLM-Based Multi-Agent system for interpretable RTL code generation. RTLSquad divides the design process into exploration, implementation, and verification &amp; evaluation stages managed by specialized agent squads, generating optimized RTL code through inter-agent collaboration, and providing decision interpretability through the communication process. Experiments show that RTLSquad excels in generating functionally correct RTL code and optimizing PPA performance, while also having the capability to provide decision paths, demonstrating the practical value of our system.</description>

      <title>Found in Translation: semantic approaches for enhancing AI interpretability in face verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of machine learning models in computer vision, particularly in face verification, requires the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to enhance interpretability and transparency. This study extends previous work by integrating semantic concepts derived from human cognitive processes into XAI frameworks to bridge the comprehension gap between model outputs and human understanding. We propose a novel approach combining global and local explanations, using semantic features defined by user-selected facial landmarks to generate similarity maps and textual explanations via large language models (LLMs). The methodology was validated through quantitative experiments and user feedback, demonstrating improved interpretability. Results indicate that our semantic-based approach, particularly the most detailed set, offers a more nuanced understanding of model decisions than traditional methods. User studies highlight a preference for our semantic explanations over traditional pixelbased heatmaps, emphasizing the benefits of human-centric interpretability in AI. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to create XAI frameworks that align AI models behaviour with human cognitive processes, fostering trust and acceptance in critical applications.</description>

      <title>Modality-Invariant Bidirectional Temporal Representation Distillation Network for Missing Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) integrates diverse modalities(text, audio, and video) to comprehensively analyze and understand individuals' emotional states. However, the real-world prevalence of incomplete data poses significant challenges to MSA, mainly due to the randomness of modality missing. Moreover, the heterogeneity issue in multimodal data has yet to be effectively addressed. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Modality-Invariant Bidirectional Temporal Representation Distillation Network (MITR-DNet) for Missing Multimodal Sentiment Analysis. MITR-DNet employs a distillation approach, wherein a complete modality teacher model guides a missing modality student model, ensuring robustness in the presence of modality missing. Simultaneously, we developed the Modality-Invariant Bidirectional Temporal Representation Learning Module (MIB-TRL) to mitigate heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation by Evidence Retroactivity in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has gained significant attention due to its ability to integrate relevant external knowledge, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the LLMs' responses. Most of the existing methods apply a dynamic multiple retrieval-generating process, to address multi-hop complex questions by decomposing them into sub-problems. However, these methods rely on an unidirectional forward reasoning paradigm, where errors from insufficient reasoning steps or inherent flaws in current retrieval systems are irreversible, potentially derailing the entire reasoning chain. For the first time, this work introduces Retroactive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RetroRAG), a novel framework to build a retroactive reasoning paradigm. RetroRAG revises and updates the evidence, redirecting the reasoning chain to the correct direction. RetroRAG constructs an evidence-collation-discovery framework to search, generate, and refine credible evidence. It synthesizes inferential evidence related to the key entities in the question from the existing source knowledge and formulates search queries to uncover additional information. As new evidence is found, RetroRAG continually updates and organizes this information, enhancing its ability to locate further necessary evidence. Paired with an Answerer to generate and evaluate outputs, RetroRAG is capable of refining its reasoning process iteratively until a reliable answer is obtained. Empirical evaluations show that RetroRAG significantly outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Language and Planning in Robotic Navigation: A Multilingual Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, trained on huge amount of datasets spanning multiple domains, exhibit significant reasoning, understanding, and planning capabilities across various tasks. This study presents the first-ever work in Arabic language integration within the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) domain in robotics, an area that has been notably underexplored in existing research. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art multi-lingual Small Language Models (SLMs), including GPT-4o mini, Llama 3 8B, and Phi-3 medium 14B, alongside the Arabic-centric LLM, Jais. Our approach utilizes the NavGPT framework, a pure LLM-based instruction-following navigation agent, to assess the impact of language on navigation reasoning through zero-shot sequential action prediction using the R2R dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of high-level planning for navigation tasks when provided with instructions in both English and Arabic. However, certain models struggled with reasoning and planning in the Arabic language due to inherent limitations in their capabilities, sub-optimal performance, and parsing issues. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing planning and reasoning capabilities in language models for effective navigation, emphasizing this as a key area for further development while also unlocking the potential of Arabic-language models for impactful real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Towards an Ontology of Traceable Impact Management in the Food Supply Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of quality improvements and accountability in the food supply chains, especially how they relate to food-related outcomes, such as hunger, has become increasingly vital, necessitating a comprehensive approach that encompasses product quality and its impact on various stakeholders and their communities. Such an approach offers numerous benefits in increasing product quality and eliminating superfluous measurements while appraising and alleviating the broader societal and environmental repercussions. A traceable impact management model (TIMM) provides an impact structure and a reporting mechanism that identifies each stakeholder's role in the total impact of food production and consumption stages.
  The model aims to increase traceability's utility in understanding the impact of changes on communities affected by food production and consumption, aligning with current and future government requirements, and addressing the needs of communities and consumers. This holistic approach is further supported by an ontological model that forms the logical foundation and a unified terminology. By proposing a holistic and integrated solution across multiple stakeholders, the model emphasizes quality and the extensive impact of championing accountability, sustainability, and responsible practices with global traceability.
  With these combined efforts, the food supply chain moves toward a global tracking and tracing process that not only ensures product quality but also addresses its impact on a broader scale, fostering accountability, sustainability, and responsible food production and consumption.</description>

      <title>Interpretable deep learning illuminates multiple structures fluorescence imaging: a path toward trustworthy artificial intelligence in microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Live-cell imaging of multiple subcellular structures is essential for understanding subcellular dynamics. However, the conventional multi-color sequential fluorescence microscopy suffers from significant imaging delays and limited number of subcellular structure separate labeling, resulting in substantial limitations for real-time live-cell research applications. Here, we present the Adaptive Explainable Multi-Structure Network (AEMS-Net), a deep-learning framework that enables simultaneous prediction of two subcellular structures from a single image. The model normalizes staining intensity and prioritizes critical image features by integrating attention mechanisms and brightness adaptation layers. Leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, our model decomposes learned features into interpretable univariate functions, enhancing the explainability of complex subcellular morphologies. We demonstrate that AEMS-Net allows real-time recording of interactions between mitochondria and microtubules, requiring only half the conventional sequential-channel imaging procedures. Notably, this approach achieves over 30% improvement in imaging quality compared to traditional deep learning methods, establishing a new paradigm for long-term, interpretable live-cell imaging that advances the ability to explore subcellular dynamics.</description>

      <title>LSEBMCL: A Latent Space Energy-Based Model for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning has become essential in many practical applications such as online news summaries and product classification. The primary challenge is known as catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon where a model inadvertently discards previously learned knowledge when it is trained on new tasks. Existing solutions involve storing exemplars from previous classes, regularizing parameters during the fine-tuning process, or assigning different model parameters to each task. The proposed solution LSEBMCL (Latent Space Energy-Based Model for Continual Learning) in this work is to use energy-based models (EBMs) to prevent catastrophic forgetting by sampling data points from previous tasks when training on new ones. The EBM is a machine learning model that associates an energy value with each input data point. The proposed method uses an EBM layer as an outer-generator in the continual learning framework for NLP tasks. The study demonstrates the efficacy of EBM in NLP tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in all experiments.</description>

      <title>FedSA: A Unified Representation Learning via Semantic Anchors for Prototype-based Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning has emerged as a promising approach that shares lightweight prototypes to transfer knowledge among clients with data heterogeneity in a model-agnostic manner. However, existing methods often collect prototypes directly from local models, which inevitably introduce inconsistencies into representation learning due to the biased data distributions and differing model architectures among clients. In this paper, we identify that both statistical and model heterogeneity create a vicious cycle of representation inconsistency, classifier divergence, and skewed prototype alignment, which negatively impacts the performance of clients. To break the vicious cycle, we propose a novel framework named Federated Learning via Semantic Anchors (FedSA) to decouple the generation of prototypes from local representation learning. We introduce a novel perspective that uses simple yet effective semantic anchors serving as prototypes to guide local models in learning consistent representations. By incorporating semantic anchors, we further propose anchor-based regularization with margin-enhanced contrastive learning and anchor-based classifier calibration to correct feature extractors and calibrate classifiers across clients, achieving intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of prototypes while ensuring consistent decision boundaries. We then update the semantic anchors with these consistent and discriminative prototypes, which iteratively encourage clients to collaboratively learn a unified data representation with robust generalization. Extensive experiments under both statistical and model heterogeneity settings show that FedSA significantly outperforms existing prototype-based FL methods on various classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Spatial Information Integration in Small Language Models for Document Layout Generation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document layout understanding is a field of study that analyzes the spatial arrangement of information in a document hoping to understand its structure and layout. Models such as LayoutLM (and its subsequent iterations) can understand semi-structured documents with SotA results; however, the lack of open semi-structured data is a limitation in itself. While semi-structured data is common in everyday life (balance sheets, purchase orders, receipts), there is a lack of public datasets for training machine learning models for this type of document. In this investigation we propose a method to generate new, synthetic, layout information that can help overcoming this data shortage. According to our results, the proposed method performs better than LayoutTransformer, another popular layout generation method. We also show that, in some scenarios, text classification can improve when supported by bounding box information.</description>

      <title>OVO-Bench: How Far is Your Video-LLMs from Real-World Online Video Understanding?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Awareness, the ability to reason dynamically based on the timestamp when a question is raised, is the key distinction between offline and online video LLMs. Unlike offline models, which rely on complete videos for static, post hoc analysis, online models process video streams incrementally and dynamically adapt their responses based on the timestamp at which the question is posed. Despite its significance, temporal awareness has not been adequately evaluated in existing benchmarks. To fill this gap, we present OVO-Bench (Online-VideO-Benchmark), a novel video benchmark that emphasizes the importance of timestamps for advanced online video understanding capability benchmarking. OVO-Bench evaluates the ability of video LLMs to reason and respond to events occurring at specific timestamps under three distinct scenarios: (1) Backward tracing: trace back to past events to answer the question. (2) Real-time understanding: understand and respond to events as they unfold at the current timestamp. (3) Forward active responding: delay the response until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the question accurately. OVO-Bench comprises 12 tasks, featuring 644 unique videos and approximately human-curated 2,800 fine-grained meta-annotations with precise timestamps. We combine automated generation pipelines with human curation. With these high-quality samples, we further developed an evaluation pipeline to systematically query video LLMs along the video timeline. Evaluations of nine Video-LLMs reveal that, despite advancements on traditional benchmarks, current models struggle with online video understanding, showing a significant gap compared to human agents. We hope OVO-Bench will drive progress in video LLMs and inspire future research in online video reasoning. Our benchmark and code can be accessed at https://github.com/JoeLeelyf/OVO-Bench.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of meaning through time: Assessment of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) grasp the historical context of concepts and their semantic evolution is essential in advancing artificial intelligence and linguistic studies. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of various LLMs in capturing temporal dynamics of meaning, specifically how they interpret terms across different time periods. We analyze a diverse set of terms from multiple domains, using tailored prompts and measuring responses through both objective metrics (e.g., perplexity and word count) and subjective human expert evaluations. Our comparative analysis includes prominent models like ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude, Bard, Gemini, and Llama. Findings reveal marked differences in each model's handling of historical context and semantic shifts, highlighting both strengths and limitations in temporal semantic understanding. These insights offer a foundation for refining LLMs to better address the evolving nature of language, with implications for historical text analysis, AI design, and applications in digital humanities.</description>

      <title>LLMQuoter: Enhancing RAG Capabilities Through Efficient Quote Extraction From Large Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LLMQuoter, a lightweight, distillation-based model designed to enhance Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by extracting the most relevant textual evidence for downstream reasoning tasks. Built on the LLaMA-3B architecture and fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a 15,000-sample subset of HotpotQA, LLMQuoter adopts a "quote-first-then-answer" strategy, efficiently identifying key quotes before passing curated snippets to reasoning models. This workflow reduces cognitive overhead and outperforms full-context approaches like Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT), achieving over 20-point accuracy gains across both small and large language models. By leveraging knowledge distillation from a high-performing teacher model, LLMQuoter achieves competitive results in a resource-efficient fine-tuning setup.

      <title>Improving Zero-Shot Object-Level Change Detection by Incorporating Visual Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting object-level changes between two images across possibly different views is a core task in many applications that involve visual inspection or camera surveillance. Existing change-detection approaches suffer from three major limitations: (1) lack of evaluation on image pairs that contain no changes, leading to unreported false positive rates; (2) lack of correspondences (\ie, localizing the regions before and after a change); and (3) poor zero-shot generalization across different domains. To address these issues, we introduce a novel method that leverages change correspondences (a) during training to improve change detection accuracy, and (b) at test time, to minimize false positives. That is, we harness the supervision labels of where an object is added or removed to supervise change detectors, improving their accuracy over previous work by a large margin. Our work is also the first to predict correspondences between pairs of detected changes using estimated homography and the Hungarian algorithm. Our model demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in change detection and change correspondence accuracy across both in-distribution and zero-shot benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Soup to go: mitigating forgetting during continual learning with model averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In continual learning, where task data arrives in a sequence, fine-tuning on later tasks will often lead to performance degradation on earlier tasks. This is especially pronounced when these tasks come from diverse domains. In this setting, how can we mitigate catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks and retain what the model has learned with minimal computational expenses? Inspired by other merging methods, and L2-regression, we propose Sequential Fine-tuning with Averaging (SFA), a method that merges currently training models with earlier checkpoints during the course of training. SOTA approaches typically maintain a data buffer of past tasks or impose a penalty at each gradient step. In contrast, our method achieves comparable results without the need to store past data, or multiple copies of parameters for each gradient step. Furthermore, our method outperforms common merging techniques such as Task Arithmetic, TIES Merging, and WiSE-FT, as well as other penalty methods like L2 and Elastic Weight Consolidation. In turn, our method offers insight into the benefits of merging partially-trained models during training across both image and language domains.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving: CLIP-Based Dynamic Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scene understanding is essential for enhancing driver safety, generating human-centric explanations for Automated Vehicle (AV) decisions, and leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for retrospective driving video analysis. This study developed a dynamic scene retrieval system using Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models, which can be optimized for real-time deployment on edge devices. The proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art in-context learning methods, including the zero-shot capabilities of GPT-4o, particularly in complex scenarios. By conducting frame-level analysis on the Honda Scenes Dataset, which contains a collection of about 80 hours of annotated driving videos capturing diverse real-world road and weather conditions, our study highlights the robustness of CLIP models in learning visual concepts from natural language supervision. Results also showed that fine-tuning the CLIP models, such as ViT-L/14 and ViT-B/32, significantly improved scene classification, achieving a top F1 score of 91.1%. These results demonstrate the ability of the system to deliver rapid and precise scene recognition, which can be used to meet the critical requirements of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). This study shows the potential of CLIP models to provide scalable and efficient frameworks for dynamic scene understanding and classification. Furthermore, this work lays the groundwork for advanced autonomous vehicle technologies by fostering a deeper understanding of driver behavior, road conditions, and safety-critical scenarios, marking a significant step toward smarter, safer, and more context-aware autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Approximate Supervised Object Distance Estimation on Unmanned Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and boats are increasingly important in maritime operations, yet their deployment is limited due to costly sensors and complexity. LiDAR, radar, and depth cameras are either costly, yield sparse point clouds or are noisy, and require extensive calibration. Here, we introduce a novel approach for approximate distance estimation in USVs using supervised object detection. We collected a dataset comprising images with manually annotated bounding boxes and corresponding distance measurements. Leveraging this data, we propose a specialized branch of an object detection model, not only to detect objects but also to predict their distances from the USV. This method offers a cost-efficient and intuitive alternative to conventional distance measurement techniques, aligning more closely with human estimation capabilities. We demonstrate its application in a marine assistance system that alerts operators to nearby objects such as boats, buoys, or other waterborne hazards.</description>

      <title>Advancing Personalized Learning Analysis via an Innovative Domain Knowledge Informed Attention-based Knowledge Tracing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging Knowledge Tracing (KT) models, particularly deep learning and attention-based Knowledge Tracing, have shown great potential in realizing personalized learning analysis via prediction of students' future performance based on their past interactions. The existing methods mainly focus on immediate past interactions or individual concepts without accounting for dependencies between knowledge concept, referred as knowledge concept routes, that can be critical to advance the understanding the students' learning outcomes. To address this, in this paper, we propose an innovative attention-based method by effectively incorporating the domain knowledge of knowledge concept routes in the given curriculum. Additionally, we leverage XES3G5M dataset, a benchmark dataset with rich auxiliary information for knowledge concept routes, to evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed method to the seven State-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Graph Neural Networks via Explanations for Ownership Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the mainstream method to learn pervasive graph data and are widely deployed in industry, making their intellectual property valuable. However, protecting GNNs from unauthorized use remains a challenge. Watermarking, which embeds ownership information into a model, is a potential solution. However, existing watermarking methods have two key limitations: First, almost all of them focus on non-graph data, with watermarking GNNs for complex graph data largely unexplored. Second, the de facto backdoor-based watermarking methods pollute training data and induce ownership ambiguity through intentional misclassification. Our explanation-based watermarking inherits the strengths of backdoor-based methods (e.g., robust to watermark removal attacks), but avoids data pollution and eliminates intentional misclassification. In particular, our method learns to embed the watermark in GNN explanations such that this unique watermark is statistically distinct from other potential solutions, and ownership claims must show statistical significance to be verified. We theoretically prove that, even with full knowledge of our method, locating the watermark is an NP-hard problem. Empirically, our method manifests robustness to removal attacks like fine-tuning and pruning. By addressing these challenges, our approach marks a significant advancement in protecting GNN intellectual property.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Model Scaling on Seen and Unseen Language Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly those trained on multilingual corpora, has intensified the need for a deeper understanding of their performance across a diverse range of languages and model sizes. Our research addresses this critical need by studying the performance and scaling behavior of multilingual LLMs in text classification and machine translation tasks across 204 languages. We systematically examine both seen and unseen languages across three model families of varying sizes in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our findings show significant differences in scaling behavior between zero-shot and two-shot scenarios, with striking disparities in performance between seen and unseen languages. Model scale has little effect on zero-shot performance, which remains mostly flat. However, in two-shot settings, larger models show clear linear improvements in multilingual text classification. For translation tasks, however, only the instruction-tuned model showed clear benefits from scaling. Our analysis also suggests that overall resource levels, not just the proportions of pretraining languages, are better predictors of model performance, shedding light on what drives multilingual LLM effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Iconicity in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lexical iconicity, a direct relation between a word's meaning and its form, is an important aspect of every natural language, most commonly manifesting through sound-meaning associations. Since Large language models' (LLMs') access to both meaning and sound of text is only mediated (meaning through textual context, sound through written representation, further complicated by tokenization), we might expect that the encoding of iconicity in LLMs would be either insufficient or significantly different from human processing. This study addresses this hypothesis by having GPT-4 generate highly iconic pseudowords in artificial languages. To verify that these words actually carry iconicity, we had their meanings guessed by Czech and German participants (n=672) and subsequently by LLM-based participants (generated by GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The results revealed that humans can guess the meanings of pseudowords in the generated iconic language more accurately than words in distant natural languages and that LLM-based participants are even more successful than humans in this task. This core finding is accompanied by several additional analyses concerning the universality of the generated language and the cues that both human and LLM-based participants utilize.</description>

Abstract: High\-cardinality categorical variables pose significant challenges in machine learning, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and model interpretability. Traditional one\-hot encoding often results in high\-dimensional sparse feature spaces, increasing the risk of overfitting and reducing scalability. This paper introduces novel encoding techniques, including means encoding, low\-rank encoding, and multinomial logistic regression encoding, to address these challenges. These methods leverage sufficient representations to generate compact and informative embeddings of categorical data. We conduct rigorous theoretical analyses and empirical validations on diverse datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in model performance and computational efficiency compared to baseline methods. The proposed techniques are particularly effective in domains requiring scalable solutions for large datasets, paving the way for more robust and efficient applications in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Collaboration of Large Language Models and Small Recommendation Models for Device-Cloud Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Recommendation (LLM4Rec) is a promising research direction that has demonstrated exceptional performance in this field. However, its inability to capture real-time user preferences greatly limits the practical application of LLM4Rec because (i) LLMs are costly to train and infer frequently, and (ii) LLMs struggle to access real-time data (its large number of parameters poses an obstacle to deployment on devices). Fortunately, small recommendation models (SRMs) can effectively supplement these shortcomings of LLM4Rec diagrams by consuming minimal resources for frequent training and inference, and by conveniently accessing real-time data on devices.
  In light of this, we designed the Device-Cloud LLM-SRM Collaborative Recommendation Framework (LSC4Rec) under a device-cloud collaboration setting. LSC4Rec aims to integrate the advantages of both LLMs and SRMs, as well as the benefits of cloud and edge computing, achieving a complementary synergy. We enhance the practicability of LSC4Rec by designing three strategies: collaborative training, collaborative inference, and intelligent request. During training, LLM generates candidate lists to enhance the ranking ability of SRM in collaborative scenarios and enables SRM to update adaptively to capture real-time user interests. During inference, LLM and SRM are deployed on the cloud and on the device, respectively. LLM generates candidate lists and initial ranking results based on user behavior, and SRM get reranking results based on the candidate list, with final results integrating both LLM's and SRM's scores. The device determines whether a new candidate list is needed by comparing the consistency of the LLM's and SRM's sorted lists. Our comprehensive and extensive experimental analysis validates the effectiveness of each strategy in LSC4Rec.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Self-Evaluation Augmented Training for Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (EMLLMs) have rapidly advanced recently. Incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and step-by-step self-evaluation has improved their performance. However, limited parameters often hinder EMLLMs from effectively using self-evaluation during inference. Key challenges include synthesizing evaluation data, determining its quantity, optimizing training and inference strategies, and selecting appropriate prompts.
  To address these issues, we introduce Self-Evaluation Augmented Training (SEAT). SEAT uses more powerful EMLLMs for CoT reasoning, data selection, and evaluation generation, then trains EMLLMs with the synthesized data. However, handling long prompts and maintaining CoT reasoning quality are problematic. Therefore, we propose Cascaded Self-Evaluation Augmented Training (Cas-SEAT), which breaks down lengthy prompts into shorter, task-specific cascaded prompts and reduces costs for resource-limited settings. During data synthesis, we employ open-source 7B-parameter EMLLMs and annotate a small dataset with short prompts.
  Experiments demonstrate that Cas-SEAT significantly boosts EMLLMs' self-evaluation abilities, improving performance by 19.68%, 55.57%, and 46.79% on the MathVista, Math-V, and We-Math datasets, respectively. Additionally, our Cas-SEAT Dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research in enhancing EMLLM self-evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) has attracted growing attention, prompting extensive research into quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to solve diverse and complex problems. Designing high-performance QML models demands expert-level proficiency, which remains a significant obstacle to the broader adoption of QML. A few major hurdles include crafting effective data encoding techniques and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are crucial to the performance of QML models. Additionally, the measurement phase is frequently overlooked-most current QML models rely on pre-defined measurement protocols that often fail to account for the specific problem being addressed. We introduce a novel approach that makes the observable of the quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-learnable. Our method features an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, where the parameterized observable is trained alongside the ordinary quantum circuit parameters simultaneously. Using numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method can identify observables for variational quantum circuits that lead to improved outcomes, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby boosting the overall performance of QML models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global placement, a critical step in designing the physical layout of computer chips, is essential to optimize chip performance. Prior global placement methods optimize each circuit design individually from scratch. Their neglect of transferable knowledge limits solution efficiency and chip performance as circuit complexity drastically increases. This study presents TransPlace, a global placement framework that learns to place millions of mixed-size cells in continuous space. TransPlace introduces i) Netlist Graph to efficiently model netlist topology, ii) Cell-flow and relative position encoding to learn SE(2)-invariant representation, iii) a tailored graph neural network architecture for informed parameterization of placement knowledge, and iv) a two-stage strategy for coarse-to-fine placement. Compared to state-of-the-art placement methods, TransPlace-trained on a few high-quality placements-can place unseen circuits with 1.2x speedup while reducing congestion by 30%, timing by 9%, and wirelength by 5%.</description>

      <title>Network Diffuser for Placing-Scheduling Service Function Chains with Inverse Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network services are increasingly managed by considering chained-up virtual network functions and relevant traffic flows, known as the Service Function Chains (SFCs). To deal with sequential arrivals of SFCs in an online fashion, we must consider two closely-coupled problems - an SFC placement problem that maps SFCs to servers/links in the network and an SFC scheduling problem that determines when each SFC is executed. Solving the whole SFC problem targeting these two optimizations jointly is extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel network diffuser using conditional generative modeling for this SFC placing-scheduling optimization. Recent advances in generative AI and diffusion models have made it possible to generate high-quality images/videos and decision trajectories from language description. We formulate the SFC optimization as a problem of generating a state sequence for planning and perform graph diffusion on the state trajectories to enable extraction of SFC decisions, with SFC optimization constraints and objectives as conditions. To address the lack of demonstration data due to NP-hardness and exponential problem space of the SFC optimization, we also propose a novel and somewhat maverick approach -- Rather than solving instances of this difficult optimization, we start with randomly-generated solutions as input, and then determine appropriate SFC optimization problems that render these solutions feasible. This inverse demonstration enables us to obtain sufficient expert demonstrations, i.e., problem-solution pairs, through further optimization. In our numerical evaluations, the proposed network diffuser outperforms learning and heuristic baselines, by $\sim$20\% improvement in SFC reward and $\sim$50\% reduction in SFC waiting time and blocking rate.</description>

      <title>EXION: Exploiting Inter- and Intra-Iteration Output Sparsity for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, diffusion models have emerged as novel AI solutions, generating diverse multi-modal outputs from text prompts. Despite their capabilities, they face challenges in computing, such as excessive latency and energy consumption due to their iterative architecture. Although prior works specialized in transformer acceleration can be applied, the iterative nature of diffusion models remains unresolved. In this paper, we present EXION, the first SW-HW co-designed diffusion accelerator that solves the computation challenges by exploiting the unique inter- and intra-iteration output sparsity in diffusion models. To this end, we propose two SW-level optimizations. First, we introduce the FFN-Reuse algorithm that identifies and skips redundant computations in FFN layers across different iterations (inter-iteration sparsity). Second, we use a modified eager prediction method that employs two-step leading-one detection to accurately predict the attention score, skipping unnecessary computations within an iteration (intra-iteration sparsity). We also introduce a novel data compaction mechanism named ConMerge, which can enhance HW utilization by condensing and merging sparse matrices into compact forms. Finally, it has a dedicated HW architecture that supports the above sparsity-inducing algorithms, translating high output sparsity into improved energy efficiency and performance. To verify the feasibility of the EXION, we first demonstrate that it has no impact on accuracy in various types of multi-modal diffusion models. We then instantiate EXION in both server- and edge-level settings and compare its performance against GPUs with similar specifications. Our evaluation shows that EXION achieves dramatic improvements in performance and energy efficiency by 3.2-379.3x and 45.1-3067.6x compared to a server GPU and by 42.6-1090.9x and 196.9-4668.2x compared to an edge GPU.</description>

      <title>Multiagent Finetuning: Self Improvement with Diverse Reasoning Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in recent years but are fundamentally limited by the underlying training data. To improve models beyond the training data, recent works have explored how LLMs can be used to generate synthetic data for autonomous self-improvement. However, successive steps of self-improvement can reach a point of diminishing returns. In this work, we propose a complementary approach towards self-improvement where finetuning is applied to a multiagent society of language models. A group of language models, all starting from the same base model, are independently specialized by updating each one using data generated through multiagent interactions among the models. By training each model on independent sets of data, we illustrate how this approach enables specialization across models and diversification over the set of models. As a result, our overall system is able to preserve diverse reasoning chains and autonomously improve over many more rounds of fine-tuning than single-agent self-improvement methods. We quantitatively illustrate the efficacy of the approach across a wide suite of reasoning tasks.</description>

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), intelligent models have evolved from mere tools to autonomous agents with their own goals and strategies for cooperating with humans. This evolution has birthed a novel paradigm in NLP, i.e., human-model cooperation, that has yielded remarkable progress in numerous NLP tasks in recent years. In this paper, we take the first step to present a thorough review of human-model cooperation, exploring its principles, formalizations, and open challenges. In particular, we introduce a new taxonomy that provides a unified perspective to summarize existing approaches. Also, we discuss potential frontier areas and their corresponding challenges. We regard our work as an entry point, paving the way for more breakthrough research in this regard.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Shark Tracking and Biometrics from Aerial Imagery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of drones for studying marine animals provides opportunities for deriving biological information from aerial imagery. The large scale of imagery data acquired from drones is well suited for machine learning (ML) analysis. Development of ML models for analyzing marine animal aerial imagery has followed the classical paradigm of training, testing, and deploying a new model for each dataset, requiring significant time, human effort, and ML expertise. We introduce Frame Level ALIgment and tRacking (FLAIR), which leverages the video understanding of Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and the vision-language capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). FLAIR takes a drone video as input and outputs segmentation masks of the species of interest across the video. Notably, FLAIR leverages a zero-shot approach, eliminating the need for labeled data, training a new model, or fine-tuning an existing model to generalize to other species. With a dataset of 18,000 drone images of Pacific nurse sharks, we trained state-of-the-art object detection models to compare against FLAIR. We show that FLAIR massively outperforms these object detectors and performs competitively against two human-in-the-loop methods for prompting SAM2, achieving a Dice score of 0.81. FLAIR readily generalizes to other shark species without additional human effort and can be combined with novel heuristics to automatically extract relevant information including length and tailbeat frequency. FLAIR has significant potential to accelerate aerial imagery analysis workflows, requiring markedly less human effort and expertise than traditional machine learning workflows, while achieving superior accuracy. By reducing the effort required for aerial imagery analysis, FLAIR allows scientists to spend more time interpreting results and deriving insights about marine ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Enabling Scalable Oversight via Self-Evolving Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable performance, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical challenge in scalable oversight: providing effective feedback for tasks where human evaluation is difficult or where LLMs outperform humans. While there is growing interest in using LLMs for critique, current approaches still rely on human annotations or more powerful models, leaving the issue of enhancing critique capabilities without external supervision unresolved. We introduce SCRIT (Self-evolving CRITic), a framework that enables genuine self-evolution of critique abilities. Technically, SCRIT self-improves by training on synthetic data, generated by a contrastive-based self-critic that uses reference solutions for step-by-step critique, and a self-validation mechanism that ensures critique quality through correction outcomes. Implemented with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, one of the most powerful LLMs, SCRIT achieves up to a 10.3\% improvement on critique-correction and error identification benchmarks. Our analysis reveals that SCRIT's performance scales positively with data and model size, outperforms alternative approaches, and benefits critically from its self-validation component.</description>

      <title>ExPO: Explainable Phonetic Trait-Oriented Network for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In speaker verification, we use computational method to verify if an utterance matches the identity of an enrolled speaker. This task is similar to the manual task of forensic voice comparison, where linguistic analysis is combined with auditory measurements to compare and evaluate voice samples. Despite much success, we have yet to develop a speaker verification system that offers explainable results comparable to those from manual forensic voice comparison. A novel approach, Explainable Phonetic Trait-Oriented (ExPO) network, is proposed in this paper to introduce the speaker's phonetic trait which describes the speaker's characteristics at the phonetic level, resembling what forensic comparison does. ExPO not only generates utterance-level speaker embeddings but also allows for fine-grained analysis and visualization of phonetic traits, offering an explainable speaker verification process. Furthermore, we investigate phonetic traits from within-speaker and between-speaker variation perspectives to determine which trait is most effective for speaker verification, marking an important step towards explainable speaker verification. Our code is available at https://github.com/mmmmayi/ExPO.</description>

      <title>Element-wise Attention Is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-attention (SA) mechanism has demonstrated superior performance across various domains, yet it suffers from substantial complexity during both training and inference. The next-generation architecture, aiming at retaining the competitive performance of SA while achieving low-cost inference and efficient long-sequence training, primarily focuses on three approaches: linear attention, linear RNNs, and state space models. Although these approaches achieve reduced complexity than SA, they all have built-in performance degradation factors, such as diminished â€œspikinessâ€ and compression of historical information. In contrast to these approaches, we propose a novel element-wise attention mechanism, which uses the element-wise squared Euclidean distance, instead of the dot product operation, to compute similarity and approximates the quadratic complexity term $\exp(q_{ic}k_{jc})$ with a Taylor polynomial. This design achieves remarkable efficiency: during training, the element-wise attention has a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(tLD)$, making long-sequence training both computationally and memory efficient, where $L$ is the sequence length, $D$ is the feature dimension, and $t$ is the highest order of the polynomial; during inference, it can be reformulated as recurrent neural networks, achieving a inference complexity of $\mathcal{O}(tD)$. Furthermore, the element-wise attention circumvents the performance degradation factors present in these approaches and achieves performance comparable to SA in both causal and non-causal forms.</description>

      <title>Migician: Revealing the Magic of Free-Form Multi-Image Grounding in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly improved their fine-grained perception of single images and general comprehension across multiple images. However, existing MLLMs still face challenges in achieving precise grounding in complex multi-image scenarios. To address this, we first explore a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework that integrates single-image grounding with multi-image comprehension. While partially effective, it remains unstable and struggles to capture abstract visual information due to its non-end-to-end nature. Therefore, we introduce Migician, the first multi-image grounding model capable of performing free-form and accurate grounding across multiple images. To support this, we present the MGrounding-630k dataset, which comprises data for several multi-image grounding tasks derived from existing datasets, along with newly generated free-form grounding instruction-following data. Furthermore, we propose MIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating multi-image grounding capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves significantly superior multi-image grounding capabilities, outperforming the best existing MLLMs by 21.61% and even surpassing much larger 70B models. Our code, model, dataset, and benchmark are fully open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Halal or Not: Knowledge Graph Completion for Predicting Cultural Appropriateness of Daily Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for halal cosmetic products has exposed significant challenges, especially in Muslim-majority countries. Recently, various machine learning-based strategies, e.g., image-based methods, have shown remarkable success in predicting the halal status of cosmetics. However, these methods mainly focus on analyzing the discrete and specific ingredients within separate cosmetics, which ignore the high-order and complex relations between cosmetics and ingredients. To address this problem, we propose a halal cosmetic recommendation framework, namely HaCKG, that leverages a knowledge graph of cosmetics and their ingredients to explicitly model and capture the relationships between cosmetics and their components. By representing cosmetics and ingredients as entities within the knowledge graph, HaCKG effectively learns the high-order and complex relations between entities, offering a robust method for predicting halal status. Specifically, we first construct a cosmetic knowledge graph representing the relations between various cosmetics, ingredients, and their properties. We then propose a pre-trained relational graph attention network model with residual connections to learn the structural relation between entities in the knowledge graph. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on downstream cosmetic data to predict halal status. Extensive experiments on the cosmetic dataset over halal prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>UV-Attack: Physical-World Adversarial Attacks for Person Detection via Dynamic-NeRF-based UV Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent research, adversarial attacks on person detectors using patches or static 3D model-based texture modifications have struggled with low success rates due to the flexible nature of human movement. Modeling the 3D deformations caused by various actions has been a major challenge. Fortunately, advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic human modeling offer new possibilities. In this paper, we introduce UV-Attack, a groundbreaking approach that achieves high success rates even with extensive and unseen human actions. We address the challenge above by leveraging dynamic-NeRF-based UV mapping. UV-Attack can generate human images across diverse actions and viewpoints, and even create novel actions by sampling from the SMPL parameter space. While dynamic NeRF models are capable of modeling human bodies, modifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural network parameters. To tackle this, UV-Attack generates UV maps instead of RGB images and modifies the texture stacks. This approach enables real-time texture edits and makes the attack more practical. We also propose a novel Expectation over Pose Transformation loss (EoPT) to improve the evasion success rate on unseen poses and views. Our experiments show that UV-Attack achieves a 92.75% attack success rate against the FastRCNN model across varied poses in dynamic video settings, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art AdvCamou attack, which only had a 28.50% ASR. Moreover, we achieve 49.5% ASR on the latest YOLOv8 detector in black-box settings. This work highlights the potential of dynamic NeRF-based UV mapping for creating more effective adversarial attacks on person detectors, addressing key challenges in modeling human movement and texture modification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, explainability in machine learning has gained importance. In this context, counterfactual explanation (CE), which is an explanation method that uses examples, has attracted attention. However, it has been pointed out that CE is not robust when there are multiple machine-learning models. These problems are important when using machine learning to make safe decisions. In this paper, we propose robust CEs that introduce a new viewpoint - Pareto improvement - and a method that uses multi-objective optimization to generate it. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments using both simulated and actual data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and useful. We believe that this research will contribute to a wide range of research areas, such as explainability in machine learning, decision-making, and action planning based on machine learning.</description>

      <title>Alignment without Over-optimization: Training-Free Solution for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel in generative tasks, but aligning them with specific objectives while maintaining their versatility remains challenging. Existing fine-tuning methods often suffer from reward over-optimization, while approximate guidance approaches fail to optimize target rewards effectively. Addressing these limitations, we propose a training-free sampling method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution. Our approach, tailored for diffusion sampling and incorporating tempering techniques, achieves comparable or superior target rewards to fine-tuning methods while preserving diversity and cross-reward generalization. We demonstrate its effectiveness in single-reward optimization, multi-objective scenarios, and online black-box optimization. This work offers a robust solution for aligning diffusion models with diverse downstream objectives without compromising their general capabilities.

      <title>Real-Time Integrated Dispatching and Idle Fleet Steering with Deep Reinforcement Learning for A Meal Delivery Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To achieve high service quality and profitability, meal delivery platforms like Uber Eats and Grubhub must strategically operate their fleets to ensure timely deliveries for current orders while mitigating the consequential impacts of suboptimal decisions that leads to courier understaffing in the future. This study set out to solve the real-time order dispatching and idle courier steering problems for a meal delivery platform by proposing a reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategic dual-control framework. To address the inherent sequential nature of these problems, we model both order dispatching and courier steering as Markov Decision Processes. Trained via a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, we obtain strategic policies by leveraging the explicitly predicted demands as part of the inputs. In our dual-control framework, the dispatching and steering policies are iteratively trained in an integrated manner. These forward-looking policies can be executed in real-time and provide decisions while jointly considering the impacts on local and network levels. To enhance dispatching fairness, we propose convolutional deep Q networks to construct fair courier embeddings. To simultaneously rebalance the supply and demand within the service network, we propose to utilize mean-field approximated supply-demand knowledge to reallocate idle couriers at the local level. Utilizing the policies generated by the RL-based strategic dual-control framework, we find the delivery efficiency and fairness of workload distribution among couriers have been improved, and under-supplied conditions have been alleviated within the service network. Our study sheds light on designing an RL-based framework to enable forward-looking real-time operations for meal delivery platforms and other on-demand services.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly adopted in modern communication networks. However, challenges in decision-making and digital modeling continue to impede their rapid advancement. Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms face limitations such as low sample efficiency and limited data versatility, further magnified in UAV communication scenarios. Moreover, Digital Twin (DT) modeling introduces substantial decision-making and data management complexities. RL models, often integrated into DT frameworks, require extensive training data to achieve accurate predictions. In contrast to traditional approaches that focus on class boundaries, Diffusion Models (DMs), a new class of generative AI, learn the underlying probability distribution from the training data and can generate trustworthy new patterns based on this learned distribution. This paper explores the integration of DMs with RL and DT to effectively address these challenges. By combining the data generation capabilities of DMs with the decision-making framework of RL and the modeling accuracy of DT, the integration improves the adaptability and real-time performance of UAV communication. Moreover, the study shows how DMs can alleviate data scarcity, improve policy networks, and optimize dynamic modeling, providing a robust solution for complex UAV communication scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision loss, particularly in India, where access to retina specialists is limited in rural areas. This study aims to evaluate the Artificial Intelligence-based Diabetic Retinopathy Screening System (AIDRSS) for DR detection and prevalence assessment, addressing the growing need for scalable, automated screening solutions in resource-limited settings.
  Approach: A multicentric, cross-sectional study was conducted in Kolkata, India, involving 5,029 participants and 10,058 macula-centric retinal fundus images. The AIDRSS employed a deep learning algorithm with 50 million trainable parameters, integrated with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) preprocessing for enhanced image quality. DR was graded using the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy (ICDR) Scale, categorizing disease into five stages (DR0 to DR4). Statistical metrics including sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence rates were evaluated against expert retina specialist assessments.
  Results: The prevalence of DR in the general population was 13.7%, rising to 38.2% among individuals with elevated random blood glucose levels. The AIDRSS achieved an overall sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 88%, and 100% sensitivity for detecting referable DR (DR3 and DR4). These results demonstrate the system's robust performance in accurately identifying and grading DR in a diverse population.
  Conclusions: AIDRSS provides a reliable, scalable solution for early DR detection in resource-constrained environments. Its integration of advanced AI techniques ensures high diagnostic accuracy, with potential to significantly reduce the burden of diabetes-related vision loss in underserved regions.</description>

      <title>VideoRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Video Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy to address the issue of generating factually incorrect outputs in foundation models by retrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into their generation process. However, existing RAG approaches have primarily focused on textual information, with some recent advancements beginning to consider images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing events, processes, and contextual details more effectively than any other modality. While a few recent studies explore the integration of videos in the response generation process, they either predefine query-associated videos without retrieving them according to queries, or convert videos into the textual descriptions without harnessing their multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a novel framework that not only dynamically retrieves relevant videos based on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information of videos in the output generation. Further, to operationalize this, our method revolves around the recent advance of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and seamless integration of the retrieved videos jointly with queries. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of VideoRAG, showcasing that it is superior to relevant baselines.</description>

      <title>EDNet: Edge-Optimized Small Target Detection in UAV Imagery -- Faster Context Attention, Better Feature Fusion, and Hardware Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting small targets in drone imagery is challenging due to low resolution, complex backgrounds, and dynamic scenes. We propose EDNet, a novel edge-target detection framework built on an enhanced YOLOv10 architecture, optimized for real-time applications without post-processing. EDNet incorporates an XSmall detection head and a Cross Concat strategy to improve feature fusion and multi-scale context awareness for detecting tiny targets in diverse environments. Our unique C2f-FCA block employs Faster Context Attention to enhance feature extraction while reducing computational complexity. The WIoU loss function is employed for improved bounding box regression. With seven model sizes ranging from Tiny to XL, EDNet accommodates various deployment environments, enabling local real-time inference and ensuring data privacy. Notably, EDNet achieves up to a 5.6% gain in mAP@50 with significantly fewer parameters. On an iPhone 12, EDNet variants operate at speeds ranging from 16 to 55 FPS, providing a scalable and efficient solution for edge-based object detection in challenging drone imagery. The source code and pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/zsniko/EDNet.</description>

      <title>Affordably Fine-tuned LLMs Provide Better Answers to Course-specific MCQs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In education, the capability of generating human-like text of Large Language Models (LLMs) inspired work on how they can increase the efficiency of learning and teaching. We study the affordability of these models for educators and students by investigating how LLMs answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with respect to hardware constraints and refinement techniques. We explore this space by using generic pre-trained LLMs (the 7B, 13B, and 70B variants of LLaMA-2) to answer 162 undergraduate-level MCQs from a course on Programming Languages (PL) -- the MCQ dataset is a contribution of this work, which we make publicly available. Specifically, we dissect how different factors, such as using readily-available material -- (parts of) the course's textbook -- for fine-tuning and quantisation (to decrease resource usage) can change the accuracy of the responses. The main takeaway is that smaller textbook-based fine-tuned models outperform generic larger ones (whose pre-training requires conspicuous resources), making the usage of LLMs for answering MCQs resource- and material-wise affordable.</description>

      <title>The New Anticipatory Governance Culture for Innovation: Regulatory Foresight, Regulatory Experimentation and Regulatory Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid pace of technological innovation, traditional methods of policy formation and legislating are becoming conspicuously anachronistic. The need for regulatory choices to be made to counter the deadening effect of regulatory lag is more important to developing markets and fostering growth than achieving one off regulatory perfection. This article advances scholarship on innovation policy and the regulation of technological innovation in the European Union. It does so by considering what building an agile yet robust anticipatory governance regulatory culture involves. It systematically excavates a variety of tools and elements that are being put into use in inventive ways and argues that these need to be more cohesively and systemically integrated into the regulatory toolbox. Approaches covered include strategic foresight, the critical embrace of iterative policy development and regulatory learning in the face of uncertainty and the embrace of bottom up approaches to cocreation of policy such as Policy Labs and the testing and regulatory learning through pilot regulation and experimentation. The growing use of regulatory sandboxes as an EU policy tool to boost innovation and navigate regulatory complexity as seen in the EU AI Act is also probed</description>

      <title>Towards Backdoor Stealthiness in Model Parameter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research on backdoor stealthiness focuses mainly on indistinguishable triggers in input space and inseparable backdoor representations in feature space, aiming to circumvent backdoor defenses that examine these respective spaces. However, existing backdoor attacks are typically designed to resist a specific type of backdoor defense without considering the diverse range of defense mechanisms. Based on this observation, we pose a natural question: Are current backdoor attacks truly a real-world threat when facing diverse practical defenses?
  To answer this question, we examine 12 common backdoor attacks that focus on input-space or feature-space stealthiness and 17 diverse representative defenses. Surprisingly, we reveal a critical blind spot: Backdoor attacks designed to be stealthy in input and feature spaces can be mitigated by examining backdoored models in parameter space. To investigate the underlying causes behind this common vulnerability, we study the characteristics of backdoor attacks in the parameter space. Notably, we find that input- and feature-space attacks introduce prominent backdoor-related neurons in parameter space, which are not thoroughly considered by current backdoor attacks. Taking comprehensive stealthiness into account, we propose a novel supply-chain attack called Grond. Grond limits the parameter changes by a simple yet effective module, Adversarial Backdoor Injection (ABI), which adaptively increases the parameter-space stealthiness during the backdoor injection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grond outperforms all 12 backdoor attacks against state-of-the-art (including adaptive) defenses on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and a subset of ImageNet. In addition, we show that ABI consistently improves the effectiveness of common backdoor attacks.</description>

      <title>DiffuSETS: 12-lead ECG Generation Conditioned on Clinical Text Reports and Patient-Specific Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heart disease remains a significant threat to human health. As a non-invasive diagnostic tool, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most widely used methods for cardiac screening. However, the scarcity of high-quality ECG data, driven by privacy concerns and limited medical resources, creates a pressing need for effective ECG signal generation. Existing approaches for generating ECG signals typically rely on small training datasets, lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks, and overlook potential applications beyond data augmentation. To address these challenges, we propose DiffuSETS, a novel framework capable of generating ECG signals with high semantic alignment and fidelity. DiffuSETS accepts various modalities of clinical text reports and patient-specific information as inputs, enabling the creation of clinically meaningful ECG signals. Additionally, to address the lack of standardized evaluation in ECG generation, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking methodology to assess the effectiveness of generative models in this domain. Our model achieve excellent results in tests, proving its superiority in the task of ECG generation. Furthermore, we showcase its potential to mitigate data scarcity while exploring novel applications in cardiology education and medical knowledge discovery, highlighting the broader impact of our work.</description>

      <title>Effective faking of verbal deception detection with target-aligned adversarial attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Deception detection through analysing language is a promising avenue using both human judgments and automated machine learning judgments. For both forms of credibility assessment, automated adversarial attacks that rewrite deceptive statements to appear truthful pose a serious threat. Methods: We used a dataset of 243 truthful and 262 fabricated autobiographical stories in a deception detection task for humans and machine learning models. A large language model was tasked to rewrite deceptive statements so that they appear truthful. In Study 1, humans who made a deception judgment or used the detailedness heuristic and two machine learning models (a fine-tuned language model and a simple n-gram model) judged original or adversarial modifications of deceptive statements. In Study 2, we manipulated the target alignment of the modifications, i.e. tailoring the attack to whether the statements would be assessed by humans or computer models. Results: When adversarial modifications were aligned with their target, human (d=-0.07 and d=-0.04) and machine judgments (51% accuracy) dropped to the chance level. When the attack was not aligned with the target, both human heuristics judgments (d=0.30 and d=0.36) and machine learning predictions (63-78%) were significantly better than chance. Conclusions: Easily accessible language models can effectively help anyone fake deception detection efforts both by humans and machine learning models. Robustness against adversarial modifications for humans and machines depends on that target alignment. We close with suggestions on advancing deception research with adversarial attack designs.</description>

      <title>Addressing speaker gender bias in large scale speech translation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the issue of speaker gender bias in Speech Translation (ST) systems, which can lead to offensive and inaccurate translations. The masculine bias often found in large-scale ST systems is typically perpetuated through training data derived from Machine Translation (MT) systems. Our approach involves two key steps. First, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to rectify translations based on the speaker's gender in a cost-effective manner. Second, we fine-tune the ST model with the corrected data, enabling the model to generate gender-specific translations directly from audio cues, without the need for explicit gender input. Additionally, we propose a three-mode fine-tuned model for scenarios where the speaker's gender is either predefined or should not be inferred from speech cues. We demonstrate a 70% improvement in translations for female speakers compared to our baseline and other large-scale ST systems, such as Seamless M4T and Canary, on the MuST-SHE test set.</description>

      <title>BRIGHT: A globally distributed multimodal building damage assessment dataset with very-high-resolution for all-weather disaster response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 12 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.</description>

      <title>How to Tune a Multilingual Encoder Model for Germanic Languages: A Study of PEFT, Full Fine-Tuning, and Language Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal use of the multilingual encoder model mDeBERTa for tasks in three Germanic languages -- German, Swedish, and Icelandic -- representing varying levels of presence and likely data quality in mDeBERTas pre-training data. We compare full fine-tuning with the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods LoRA and Pfeiffer bottleneck adapters, finding that PEFT is more effective for the higher-resource language, German. However, results for Swedish and Icelandic are less consistent. We also observe differences between tasks: While PEFT tends to work better for question answering, full fine-tuning is preferable for named entity recognition. Inspired by previous research on modular approaches that combine task and language adapters, we evaluate the impact of adding PEFT modules trained on unstructured text, finding that this approach is not beneficial.</description>

      <title>AI-powered virtual tissues from spatial proteomics for clinical diagnostics and biomedical discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial proteomics technologies have transformed our understanding of complex tissue architectures by enabling simultaneous analysis of multiple molecular markers and their spatial organization. The high dimensionality of these data, varying marker combinations across experiments and heterogeneous study designs pose unique challenges for computational analysis. Here, we present Virtual Tissues (VirTues), a foundation model framework for biological tissues that operates across the molecular, cellular and tissue scale. VirTues introduces innovations in transformer architecture design, including a novel tokenization scheme that captures both spatial and marker dimensions, and attention mechanisms that scale to high-dimensional multiplex data while maintaining interpretability. Trained on diverse cancer and non-cancer tissue datasets, VirTues demonstrates strong generalization capabilities without task-specific fine-tuning, enabling cross-study analysis and novel marker integration. As a generalist model, VirTues outperforms existing approaches across clinical diagnostics, biological discovery and patient case retrieval tasks, while providing insights into tissue function and disease mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) encodes relative and absolute positional information in Transformer-based models through rotation matrices applied to input vectors within sequences. While RoPE has demonstrated superior performance compared to other positional embedding technologies in natural language processing tasks, its effectiveness in speech processing applications remains understudied. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of RoPE across diverse automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that for ASR tasks, RoPE consistently achieves lower error rates compared to the currently widely used relative positional embedding. To facilitate further research, we release the implementation and all experimental recipes through the SpeechBrain toolkit.</description>

Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.</description>

      <title>Explaining k-Nearest Neighbors: Abductive and Counterfactual Explanations</title>

Abstract: Despite the wide use of $k$-Nearest Neighbors as classification models, their explainability properties remain poorly understood from a theoretical perspective. While nearest neighbors classifiers offer interpretability from a "data perspective", in which the classification of an input vector $\bar{x}$ is explained by identifying the vectors $\bar{v}_1, \ldots, \bar{v}_k$ in the training set that determine the classification of $\bar{x}$, we argue that such explanations can be impractical in high-dimensional applications, where each vector has hundreds or thousands of features and it is not clear what their relative importance is. Hence, we focus on understanding nearest neighbor classifications through a "feature perspective", in which the goal is to identify how the values of the features in $\bar{x}$ affect its classification. Concretely, we study abductive explanations such as "minimum sufficient reasons", which correspond to sets of features in $\bar{x}$ that are enough to guarantee its classification, and "counterfactual explanations" based on the minimum distance feature changes one would have to perform in $\bar{x}$ to change its classification. We present a detailed landscape of positive and negative complexity results for counterfactual and abductive explanations, distinguishing between discrete and continuous feature spaces, and considering the impact of the choice of distance function involved. Finally, we show that despite some negative complexity results, Integer Quadratic Programming and SAT solving allow for computing explanations in practice.</description>

      <title>Scale-up Unlearnable Examples Learning with High-Performance Computing</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI models are structured to retain user interactions, which could inadvertently include sensitive healthcare data. In the healthcare field, particularly when radiologists use AI-driven diagnostic tools hosted on online platforms, there is a risk that medical imaging data may be repurposed for future AI training without explicit consent, spotlighting critical privacy and intellectual property concerns around healthcare data usage. Addressing these privacy challenges, a novel approach known as Unlearnable Examples (UEs) has been introduced, aiming to make data unlearnable to deep learning models. A prominent method within this area, called Unlearnable Clustering (UC), has shown improved UE performance with larger batch sizes but was previously limited by computational resources. To push the boundaries of UE performance with theoretically unlimited resources, we scaled up UC learning across various datasets using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training on the Summit supercomputer. Our goal was to examine UE efficacy at high-performance computing (HPC) levels to prevent unauthorized learning and enhance data security, particularly exploring the impact of batch size on UE's unlearnability. Utilizing the robust computational capabilities of the Summit, extensive experiments were conducted on diverse datasets such as Pets, MedMNist, Flowers, and Flowers102. Our findings reveal that both overly large and overly small batch sizes can lead to performance instability and affect accuracy. However, the relationship between batch size and unlearnability varied across datasets, highlighting the necessity for tailored batch size strategies to achieve optimal data protection. Our results underscore the critical role of selecting appropriate batch sizes based on the specific characteristics of each dataset to prevent learning and ensure data security in deep learning applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Developing Socially Compliant Automated Vehicles: State of the Art, Experts Expectations, and A Conceptual Framework</title>

Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AVs) hold promise for revolutionizing transportation by improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall mobility. Despite the steady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full automation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation levels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant and understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs compatibility with HDVs and social acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into mixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially Compliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first comprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in developing SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. An expert interview was also conducted to identify critical research gaps and expectations towards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a conceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual framework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers, technicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of integrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research perspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and development agenda of SCAVs.</description>

      <title>Explaining Deep Learning-based Anomaly Detection in Energy Consumption Data by Focusing on Contextually Relevant Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in energy consumption data is crucial for identifying energy waste, equipment malfunction, and overall, for ensuring efficient energy management. Machine learning, and specifically deep learning approaches, have been greatly successful in anomaly detection; however, they are black-box approaches that do not provide transparency or explanations. SHAP and its variants have been proposed to explain these models, but they suffer from high computational complexity (SHAP) or instability and inconsistency (e.g., Kernel SHAP). To address these challenges, this paper proposes an explainability approach for anomalies in energy consumption data that focuses on context-relevant information. The proposed approach leverages existing explainability techniques, focusing on SHAP variants, together with global feature importance and weighted cosine similarity to select background dataset based on the context of each anomaly point. By focusing on the context and most relevant features, this approach mitigates the instability of explainability algorithms. Experimental results across 10 different machine learning models, five datasets, and five XAI techniques, demonstrate that our method reduces the variability of explanations providing consistent explanations. Statistical analyses confirm the robustness of our approach, showing an average reduction in variability of approximately 38% across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Fleurs-SLU: A Massively Multilingual Benchmark for Spoken Language Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent multilingual automatic speech recognition models claim to support thousands of languages, ASR for low-resource languages remains highly unreliable due to limited bimodal speech and text training data. Better multilingual spoken language understanding (SLU) can strengthen massively the robustness of multilingual ASR by levering language semantics to compensate for scarce training data, such as disambiguating utterances via context or exploiting semantic similarities across languages. Even more so, SLU is indispensable for inclusive speech technology in roughly half of all living languages that lack a formal writing system. However, the evaluation of multilingual SLU remains limited to shallower tasks such as intent classification or language identification. To address this, we present Fleurs-SLU, a multilingual SLU benchmark that encompasses topical speech classification in 102 languages and multiple-choice question answering through listening comprehension in 92 languages. We extensively evaluate both end-to-end speech classification models and cascaded systems that combine speech-to-text transcription with subsequent classification by large language models on Fleurs-SLU. Our results show that cascaded systems exhibit greater robustness in multilingual SLU tasks, though speech encoders can achieve competitive performance in topical speech classification when appropriately pre-trained. We further find a strong correlation between robust multilingual ASR, effective speech-to-text translation, and strong multilingual SLU, highlighting the mutual benefits between acoustic and semantic speech representations.</description>

      <title>Contextual ASR Error Handling with LLMs Augmentation for Goal-Oriented Conversational AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems do not always perform well in goal-oriented dialogue. Existing ASR correction methods rely on prior user data or named entities. We extend correction to tasks that have no prior user data and exhibit linguistic flexibility such as lexical and syntactic variations. We propose a novel context augmentation with a large language model and a ranking strategy that incorporates contextual information from the dialogue states of a goal-oriented conversational AI and its tasks. Our method ranks (1) n-best ASR hypotheses by their lexical and semantic similarity with context and (2) context by phonetic correspondence with ASR hypotheses. Evaluated in home improvement and cooking domains with real-world users, our method improves recall and F1 of correction by 34% and 16%, respectively, while maintaining precision and false positive rate. Users rated .8-1 point (out of 5) higher when our correction method worked properly, with no decrease due to false positives.</description>

      <title>CoDriveVLM: VLM-Enhanced Urban Cooperative Dispatching and Motion Planning for Future Autonomous Mobility on Demand Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for flexible and efficient urban transportation solutions has spotlighted the limitations of traditional Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) systems, particularly in accommodating diverse passenger needs and dynamic urban environments. Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to provide responsive and adaptable services. However, existing methods primarily focus on either vehicle scheduling or path planning, which often simplify complex urban layouts and neglect the necessity for simultaneous coordination and mutual avoidance among CAVs. This oversimplification poses significant challenges to the deployment of AMoD systems in real-world scenarios. To address these gaps, we propose CoDriveVLM, a novel framework that integrates high-fidelity simultaneous dispatching and cooperative motion planning for future AMoD systems. Our method harnesses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance multi-modality information processing, and this enables comprehensive dispatching and collision risk evaluation. The VLM-enhanced CAV dispatching coordinator is introduced to effectively manage complex and unforeseen AMoD conditions, thus supporting efficient scheduling decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a scalable decentralized cooperative motion planning method via consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) focusing on collision risk evaluation and decentralized trajectory optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of CoDriveVLM in various traffic conditions, showcasing its potential to significantly improve the fidelity and effectiveness of AMoD systems in future urban transportation networks.

      <title>Emergent Symbol-like Number Variables in Artificial Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What types of numeric representations emerge in Neural Networks (NNs)? To what degree do NNs induce abstract, mutable, slot-like numeric variables, and in what situations do these representations emerge? How do these representations change over learning, and how can we understand the neural implementations in ways that are unified across different NNs? In this work, we approach these questions by first training sequence based neural systems using Next Token Prediction (NTP) objectives on numeric tasks. We then seek to understand the neural solutions through the lens of causal abstractions or symbolic algorithms. We use a combination of causal interventions and visualization methods to find that artificial neural models do indeed develop analogs of interchangeable, mutable, latent number variables purely from the NTP objective. We then ask how variations on the tasks and model architectures affect the models' learned solutions to find that these symbol-like numeric representations do not form for every variant of the task, and transformers solve the problem in a notably different way than their recurrent counterparts. We then show how the symbol-like variables change over the course of training to find a strong correlation between the models' task performance and the alignment of their symbol-like representations. Lastly, we show that in all cases, some degree of gradience exists in these neural symbols, highlighting the difficulty of finding simple, interpretable symbolic stories of how neural networks perform numeric tasks. Taken together, our results are consistent with the view that neural networks can approximate interpretable symbolic programs of number cognition, but the particular program they approximate and the extent to which they approximate it can vary widely, depending on the network architecture, training data, extent of training, and network size.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Performance of a Multimodal Artificial Intelligence System on Multisubject Physics Concept Inventories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multilingual and multimodal performance of a large language model-based artificial intelligence (AI) system, GPT-4o, on a diverse set of physics concept inventories spanning multiple languages and subject areas. The inventories taken from the PhysPort website cover the classical physics topics of mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, and thermodynamics as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, astronomy, mathematics, and laboratory skills. Unlike previous text-only studies, we uploaded the inventories as images mirroring what a student would see on paper, assessing the system's multimodal functionality. The AI is prompted in English and autonomously chooses the language of its response - either remaining in the nominal language of the test, switching entirely to English, or mixing languages - revealing adaptive behavior dependent on linguistic complexity and data availability. Our results indicate some variation in performance across subject areas, with laboratory skills standing out as the area of poorest performance. Furthermore, the AI's performance on questions that require visual interpretation of images is worse than on purely text-based questions. Questions that are difficult for the AI tend to be that way invariably of the inventory language. We also find large variations in performance across languages, with some appearing to benefit substantially from language switching, a phenomenon similar to code-switching ofhuman speakers. Overall, comparing the obtained AI results to the existing literature, we find that the AI system outperforms average undergraduate students post-instruction in all subject areas but laboratory skills.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While attention-based architectures, such as Conformers, excel in speech enhancement, they face challenges such as scalability with respect to input sequence length. In contrast, the recently proposed Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture offers linear scalability. However, xLSTM-based models remain unexplored for speech enhancement. This paper introduces xLSTM-SENet, the first xLSTM-based single-channel speech enhancement system. A comparative analysis reveals that xLSTM-and notably, even LSTM-can match or outperform state-of-the-art Mamba- and Conformer-based systems across various model sizes in speech enhancement on the VoiceBank+Demand dataset. Through ablation studies, we identify key architectural design choices such as exponential gating and bidirectionality contributing to its effectiveness. Our best xLSTM-based model, xLSTM-SENet2, outperforms state-of-the-art Mamba- and Conformer-based systems on the Voicebank+DEMAND dataset.</description>

Abstract: When can we say that two neural systems are the same? The answer to this question is goal-dependent, and it is often addressed through correlative methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). What do we miss when we forgo causal explorations, and how can we target specific types of similarity? In this work, we introduce Model Alignment Search (MAS), a method for causally exploring distributed representational similarity. The method learns invertible linear transformations that align a subspace between two distributed networks' representations where causal information can be freely interchanged. We first show that the method can be used to transfer specific causal variables, such as the number of items in a counting task, between networks with different training seeds. We then explore open questions in number cognition by comparing different types of numeric representations in models trained on structurally different numeric tasks. We then explore differences between MAS vs preexisting causal similarity methods, showing MAS to be more resistant to unwanted exchanges. Lastly, we introduce a counterfactual latent auxiliary loss function that helps shape causally relevant alignments even in cases where we do not have causal access to one of the two models for training.</description>

      <title>MARS: A neurosymbolic approach for interpretable drug discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence describes the combination of logic or rule-based techniques with neural networks. Compared to neural approaches, NeSy methods often possess enhanced interpretability, which is particularly promising for biomedical applications like drug discovery. However, since interpretability is broadly defined, there are no clear guidelines for assessing the biological plausibility of model interpretations. To assess interpretability in the context of drug discovery, we devise a novel prediction task, called drug mechanism-of-action (MoA) deconvolution, with an associated, tailored knowledge graph (KG), MoA-net. We then develop the MoA Retrieval System (MARS), a NeSy approach for drug discovery which leverages logical rules with learned rule weights. Using this interpretable feature alongside domain knowledge, we find that MARS and other NeSy approaches on KGs are susceptible to reasoning shortcuts, in which the prediction of true labels is driven by "degree-bias" rather than the domain-based rules. Subsequently, we demonstrate ways to identify and mitigate this. Thereafter, MARS achieves performance on par with current state-of-the-art models while producing model interpretations aligned with known MoAs.</description>

      <title>CORD: Generalizable Cooperation via Role Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to develop agents that can collaborate effectively. However, most cooperative MARL methods overfit training agents, making learned policies not generalize well to unseen collaborators, which is a critical issue for real-world deployment. Some methods attempt to address the generalization problem but require prior knowledge or predefined policies of new teammates, limiting real-world applications. To this end, we propose a hierarchical MARL approach to enable generalizable cooperation via role diversity, namely CORD. CORD's high-level controller assigns roles to low-level agents by maximizing the role entropy with constraints. We show this constrained objective can be decomposed into causal influence in role that enables reasonable role assignment, and role heterogeneity that yields coherent, non-redundant role clusters. Evaluated on a variety of cooperative multi-agent tasks, CORD achieves better performance than baselines, especially in generalization tests. Ablation studies further demonstrate the efficacy of the constrained objective in generalizable cooperation.</description>

      <title>Dolphin: Closed-loop Open-ended Auto-research through Thinking, Practice, and Feedback</title>

Abstract: The scientific research paradigm is undergoing a profound transformation owing to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent works demonstrate that various AI-assisted research methods can largely improve research efficiency by improving data analysis, accelerating computation, and fostering novel idea generation. To further move towards the ultimate goal (i.e., automatic scientific research), in this paper, we propose Dolphin, the first closed-loop open-ended auto-research framework to further build the entire process of human scientific research. Dolphin can generate research ideas, perform experiments, and get feedback from experimental results to generate higher-quality ideas. More specifically, Dolphin first generates novel ideas based on relevant papers which are ranked by the topic and task attributes. Then, the codes are automatically generated and debugged with the exception-traceback-guided local code structure. Finally, Dolphin automatically analyzes the results of each idea and feeds the results back to the next round of idea generation. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets of different topics and results show that Dolphin can generate novel ideas continuously and complete the experiment in a loop. We highlight that Dolphin can automatically propose methods that are comparable to the state-of-the-art in some tasks such as 2D image classification and 3D point classification.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised video pretraining yields robust and more human-aligned visual representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans learn powerful representations of objects and scenes by observing how they evolve over time. Yet, outside of specific tasks that require explicit temporal understanding, static image pretraining remains the dominant paradigm for learning visual foundation models. We question this mismatch, and ask whether video pretraining can yield visual representations that bear the hallmarks of human perception: generalisation across tasks, robustness to perturbations, and consistency with human judgements. To that end we propose a novel procedure for curating videos, and develop a contrastive framework which learns from the complex transformations therein. This simple paradigm for distilling knowledge from videos, called VITO, yields general representations that far outperform prior video pretraining methods on image understanding tasks, and image pretraining methods on video understanding tasks. Moreover, VITO representations are significantly more robust to natural and synthetic deformations than image-, video-, and adversarially-trained ones. Finally, VITO's predictions are strongly aligned with human judgements, surpassing models that were specifically trained for that purpose. Together, these results suggest that video pretraining could be a simple way of learning unified, robust, and human-aligned representations of the visual world.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Detection by Approximation of Ensemble Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10227v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite being effective in many application areas, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to being attacked. In object recognition, the attack takes the form of a small perturbation added to an image, that causes the DNN to misclassify, but to a human appears no different. Adversarial attacks lead to defences that are themselves subject to attack, and the attack/ defence strategies provide important information about the properties of DNNs. In this paper, a novel method of detecting adversarial attacks is proposed for an ensemble of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) solving two-class pattern recognition problems. The ensemble is combined using Walsh coefficients which are capable of approximating Boolean functions and thereby controlling the decision boundary complexity. The hypothesis in this paper is that decision boundaries with high curvature allow adversarial perturbations to be found, but change the curvature of the decision boundary, which is then approximated in a different way by Walsh coefficients compared to the clean images. Besides controlling boundary complexity, the coefficients also measure the correlation with class labels, which may aid in understanding the learning and transferability properties of DNNs. While the experiments here use images, the proposed approach of modelling two-class ensemble decision boundaries could in principle be applied to any application area.</description>

      <title>An Optimal, Universal and Agnostic Decoding Method for Message Reconstruction, Bio and Technosignature Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an agnostic signal reconstruction method for zero-knowledge one-way communication channels in which a receiver aims to interpret a message sent by an unknown source about which no prior knowledge is available and to which no return message can be sent. Our reconstruction method is agnostic vis-\`a-vis the arbitrarily chosen encoding-decoding scheme and other observer-dependent characteristics, such as the arbitrarily chosen computational model, probability distributions, or underlying mathematical theory. We investigate how non-random messages encode information about their intended physical properties, such as dimension and length scales of the space in which a signal or message may have been originally encoded, embedded, or generated. We focus on image data as a first illustration of the capabilities of the new method. We argue that our results have applications to life and technosignature detection, and to coding theory in general.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Class Tokens for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17155v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the generation of diverse and high-quality images. While impressive, the images often fall short of depicting subtle details and are susceptible to errors due to ambiguity in the input text. One way of alleviating these issues is to train diffusion models on class-labeled datasets. This approach has two disadvantages: (i) supervised datasets are generally small compared to large-scale scraped text-image datasets on which text-to-image models are trained, affecting the quality and diversity of the generated images, or (ii) the input is a hard-coded label, as opposed to free-form text, limiting the control over the generated images.
  In this work, we propose a non-invasive fine-tuning technique that capitalizes on the expressive potential of free-form text while achieving high accuracy through discriminative signals from a pretrained classifier. This is done by iteratively modifying the embedding of an added input token of a text-to-image diffusion model, by steering generated images toward a given target class according to a classifier. Our method is fast compared to prior fine-tuning methods and does not require a collection of in-class images or retraining of a noise-tolerant classifier. We evaluate our method extensively, showing that the generated images are: (i) more accurate and of higher quality than standard diffusion models, (ii) can be used to augment training data in a low-resource setting, and (iii) reveal information about the data used to train the guiding classifier. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/idansc/discriminative_class_tokens}.</description>

      <title>GUTS: Generalized Uncertainty-Aware Thompson Sampling for Multi-Agent Active Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic solutions for quick disaster response are essential to ensure minimal loss of life, especially when the search area is too dangerous or too vast for human rescuers. We model this problem as an asynchronous multi-agent active-search task where each robot aims to efficiently seek objects of interest (OOIs) in an unknown environment. This formulation addresses the requirement that search missions should focus on quick recovery of OOIs rather than full coverage of the search region. Previous approaches fail to accurately model sensing uncertainty, account for occlusions due to foliage or terrain, or consider the requirement for heterogeneous search teams and robustness to hardware and communication failures. We present the Generalized Uncertainty-aware Thompson Sampling (GUTS) algorithm, which addresses these issues and is suitable for deployment on heterogeneous multi-robot systems for active search in large unstructured environments. We show through simulation experiments that GUTS consistently outperforms existing methods such as parallelized Thompson Sampling and exhaustive search, recovering all OOIs in 80% of all runs. In contrast, existing approaches recover all OOIs in less than 40% of all runs. We conduct field tests using our multi-robot system in an unstructured environment with a search area of approximately 75,000 sq. m. Our system demonstrates robustness to various failure modes, achieving full recovery of OOIs (where feasible) in every field run, and significantly outperforming our baseline.</description>

      <title>A Pre-trained Data Deduplication Model based on Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00721v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of big data, the issue of data quality has become increasingly prominent. One of the main challenges is the problem of duplicate data, which can arise from repeated entry or the merging of multiple data sources. These "dirty data" problems can significantly limit the effective application of big data. To address the issue of data deduplication, we propose a pre-trained deduplication model based on active learning, which is the first work that utilizes active learning to address the problem of deduplication at the semantic level. The model is built on a pre-trained Transformer and fine-tuned to solve the deduplication problem as a sequence to classification task, which firstly integrate the transformer with active learning into an end-to-end architecture to select the most valuable data for deduplication model training, and also firstly employ the R-Drop method to perform data augmentation on each round of labeled data, which can reduce the cost of manual labeling and improve the model's performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) for deduplicated data identification, achieving up to a 28% improvement in Recall score on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Gaze-Informed Vision Transformers: Predicting Driving Decisions Under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have advanced computer vision, yet their efficacy in complex tasks like driving remains less explored. This study enhances ViT by integrating human eye gaze, captured via eye-tracking, to increase prediction accuracy in driving scenarios under uncertainty in both real-world and virtual reality scenarios. First, we establish the significance of human eye gaze in left-right driving decisions, as observed in both human subjects and a ViT model. By comparing the similarity between human fixation maps and ViT attention weights, we reveal the dynamics of overlap across individual heads and layers. This overlap demonstrates that fixation data can guide the model in distributing its attention weights more effectively. We introduce the fixation-attention intersection (FAX) loss, a novel loss function that significantly improves ViT performance under high uncertainty conditions. Our results show that ViT, when trained with FAX loss, aligns its attention with human gaze patterns. This gaze-informed approach has significant potential for driver behavior analysis, as well as broader applications in human-centered AI systems, extending ViT's use to complex visual environments.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-based Autotuning for Randomized Sketching Algorithms in Regression Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms from Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) are known to be effective in handling high-dimensional computational problems, providing high-quality empirical performance as well as strong probabilistic guarantees. However, their practical application is complicated by the fact that the user needs to set various algorithm-specific tuning parameters which are different than those used in traditional NLA. This paper demonstrates how a surrogate-based autotuning approach can be used to address fundamental problems of parameter selection in RandNLA algorithms. In particular, we provide a detailed investigation of surrogate-based autotuning for sketch-and-precondition (SAP) based randomized least squares methods, which have been one of the great success stories in modern RandNLA. Empirical results show that our surrogate-based autotuning approach can achieve near-optimal performance with much less tuning cost than a random search (up to about 4x fewer trials of different parameter configurations). Moreover, while our experiments focus on least squares, our results demonstrate a general-purpose autotuning pipeline applicable to any kind of RandNLA algorithm.</description>

      <title>KITS: Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Increment Training Strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03056v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curation of literature in life sciences is a growing challenge. The continued increase in the rate of publication, coupled with the relatively fixed number of curators worldwide presents a major challenge to developers of biomedical knowledgebases. Very few knowledgebases have resources to scale to the whole relevant literature and all have to prioritise their efforts.
  In this work, we take a first step to alleviating the lack of curator time in RNA science by generating summaries of literature for non-coding RNAs using large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that high-quality, factually accurate summaries with accurate references can be automatically generated from the literature using a commercial LLM and a chain of prompts and checks. Manual assessment was carried out for a subset of summaries, with the majority being rated extremely high quality.
  We apply our tool to a selection of over 4,600 ncRNAs and make the generated summaries available via the RNAcentral resource. We conclude that automated literature summarization is feasible with the current generation of LLMs, provided careful prompting and automated checking are applied.</description>

      <title>AlgoFormer: An Efficient Transformer Framework with Algorithmic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Besides natural language processing, transformers exhibit extraordinary performance in solving broader applications, including scientific computing and computer vision. Previous works try to explain this from the expressive power and capability perspectives that standard transformers are capable of performing some algorithms. To empower transformers with algorithmic capabilities and motivated by the recently proposed looped transformer, we design a novel transformer framework, dubbed Algorithm Transformer (abbreviated as AlgoFormer). We provide an insight that efficient transformer architectures can be designed by leveraging prior knowledge of tasks and the underlying structure of potential algorithms. Compared with the standard transformer and vanilla looped transformer, the proposed AlgoFormer can perform efficiently in algorithm representation in some specific tasks. In particular, inspired by the structure of human-designed learning algorithms, our transformer framework consists of a pre-transformer that is responsible for task preprocessing, a looped transformer for iterative optimization algorithms, and a post-transformer for producing the desired results after post-processing. We provide theoretical evidence of the expressive power of the AlgoFormer in solving some challenging problems, mirroring human-designed algorithms. Furthermore, some theoretical and empirical results are presented to show that the designed transformer has the potential to perform algorithm representation and learning. Experimental results demonstrate the empirical superiority of the proposed transformer in that it outperforms the standard transformer and vanilla looped transformer in some specific tasks. An extensive experiment on real language tasks (e.g., neural machine translation of German and English, and text classification) further validates the expressiveness and effectiveness of AlgoFormer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of the open-source language model landscape presents an opportunity to merge the competencies of these model checkpoints by combining their parameters. Advances in transfer learning, the process of fine-tuning pretrained models for specific tasks, has resulted in the development of vast amounts of task-specific models, typically specialized in individual tasks and unable to utilize each other's strengths. Model merging facilitates the creation of multitask models without the need for additional training, offering a promising avenue for enhancing model performance and versatility. By preserving the intrinsic capabilities of the original models, model merging addresses complex challenges in AI - including the difficulties of catastrophic forgetting and multitask learning. To support this expanding area of research, we introduce MergeKit, a comprehensive, open-source library designed to facilitate the application of model merging strategies. MergeKit offers an extensible framework to efficiently merge models on any hardware, providing utility to researchers and practitioners. To date, thousands of models have been merged by the open-source community, leading to the creation of some of the worlds most powerful open-source model checkpoints, as assessed by the Open LLM Leaderboard. The library is accessible at https://github.com/arcee-ai/MergeKit.</description>

      <title>SafetyPrompts: a Systematic Review of Open Datasets for Evaluating and Improving Large Language Model Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last two years have seen a rapid growth in concerns around the safety of large language models (LLMs). Researchers and practitioners have met these concerns by creating an abundance of datasets for evaluating and improving LLM safety. However, much of this work has happened in parallel, and with very different goals in mind, ranging from the mitigation of near-term risks around bias and toxic content generation to the assessment of longer-term catastrophic risk potential. This makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to find the most relevant datasets for their use case, and to identify gaps in dataset coverage that future work may fill. To remedy these issues, we conduct a first systematic review of open datasets for evaluating and improving LLM safety. We review 144 datasets, which we identified through an iterative and community-driven process over the course of several months. We highlight patterns and trends, such as a trend towards fully synthetic datasets, as well as gaps in dataset coverage, such as a clear lack of non-English and naturalistic datasets. We also examine how LLM safety datasets are used in practice -- in LLM release publications and popular LLM benchmarks -- finding that current evaluation practices are highly idiosyncratic and make use of only a small fraction of available datasets. Our contributions are based on SafetyPrompts.com, a living catalogue of open datasets for LLM safety, which we plan to update continuously as the field of LLM safety develops.</description>

      <title>Is Table Retrieval a Solved Problem? Exploring Join-Aware Multi-Table Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieving relevant tables containing the necessary information to accurately answer a given question over tables is critical to open-domain question-answering (QA) systems. Previous methods assume the answer to such a question can be found either in a single table or multiple tables identified through question decomposition or rewriting. However, neither of these approaches is sufficient, as many questions require retrieving multiple tables and joining them through a join plan that cannot be discerned from the user query itself. If the join plan is not considered in the retrieval stage, the subsequent steps of reasoning and answering based on those retrieved tables are likely to be incorrect. To address this problem, we introduce a method that uncovers useful join relations for any query and database during table retrieval. We use a novel re-ranking method formulated as a mixed-integer program that considers not only table-query relevance but also table-table relevance that requires inferring join relationships. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for table retrieval by up to 9.3% in F1 score and for end-to-end QA by up to 5.4% in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Expected Coordinate Improvement for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is very popular for solving low-dimensional expensive optimization problems. Extending Bayesian optimization to high dimension is a meaningful but challenging task. One of the major challenges is that it is difficult to find good infill solutions as the acquisition functions are also high-dimensional. In this work, we propose the expected coordinate improvement (ECI) criterion for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization. The proposed ECI criterion measures the potential improvement we can get by moving the current best solution along one coordinate. The proposed approach selects the coordinate with the highest ECI value to refine in each iteration and covers all the coordinates gradually by iterating over the coordinates. The greatest advantage of the proposed ECI-BO (expected coordinate improvement based Bayesian optimization) algorithm over the standard BO algorithm is that the infill selection problem of the proposed algorithm is always a one-dimensional problem thus can be easily solved. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significantly better results than the standard BO algorithm and competitive results when compared with five state-of-the-art high-dimensional BOs. This work provides a simple but efficient approach for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organ segmentation is a fundamental task in medical imaging since it is useful for many clinical automation pipelines. However, some tasks do not require full segmentation. Instead, a classifier can identify the selected organ without segmenting the entire volume. In this study, we demonstrate a classifier based method to obtain organ labels in real time by using a large context size with a sparse data sampling strategy. Although our method operates as an independent classifier at query locations, it can generate full segmentations by querying grid locations at any resolution, offering faster performance than segmentation algorithms. We compared our method with existing segmentation techniques, demonstrating its superior runtime potential for practical applications in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>NV-Embed: Improved Techniques for Training LLMs as Generalist Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoder-only large language model (LLM)-based embedding models are beginning to outperform BERT or T5-based embedding models in general-purpose text embedding tasks, including dense vector-based retrieval. In this work, we introduce the NV-Embed model, incorporating architectural designs, training procedures, and curated datasets to significantly enhance the performance of LLM as a versatile embedding model, while maintaining its simplicity and reproducibility. For model architecture, we propose a latent attention layer to obtain pooled embeddings, which consistently improves retrieval and downstream task accuracy compared to mean pooling or using the last &lt;EOS&gt; token embedding from LLMs. To enhance representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask of LLMs during contrastive training. For training algorithm, we introduce a two-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. It first applies contrastive training with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negatives and curated hard negative examples. At stage-2, it blends various non-retrieval into instruction tuning, which not only enhances non-retrieval task accuracy but also improves retrieval performance. For training data, we utilize the hard-negative mining, synthetic data generation and existing public available datasets to boost the performance of embedding model. By combining these techniques, our NV-Embed-v1 and NV-Embed-v2 models obtained the No.1 position on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) (as of May 24, 2024 and August 30, 2024, respectively) across 56 embedding tasks, demonstrating the sustained effectiveness of the proposed methods over time. Additionally, it achieved the highest scores in the Long Doc section and the second-highest scores in the QA section of the AIR Benchmark, which covers a range of out-of-domain information retrieval topics beyond those in MTEB.</description>

      <title>4-bit Shampoo for Memory-Efficient Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Second-order optimizers, maintaining a matrix termed a preconditioner, are superior to first-order optimizers in both theory and practice. The states forming the preconditioner and its inverse root restrict the maximum size of models trained by second-order optimizers. To address this, compressing 32-bit optimizer states to lower bitwidths has shown promise in reducing memory usage. However, current approaches only pertain to first-order optimizers. In this paper, we propose the first 4-bit second-order optimizers, exemplified by 4-bit Shampoo, maintaining performance similar to that of 32-bit ones. We show that quantizing the eigenvector matrix of the preconditioner in 4-bit Shampoo is remarkably better than quantizing the preconditioner itself both theoretically and experimentally. By rectifying the orthogonality of the quantized eigenvector matrix, we enhance the approximation of the preconditioner's eigenvector matrix, which also benefits the computation of its inverse 4-th root. Besides, we find that linear square quantization slightly outperforms dynamic tree quantization when quantizing second-order optimizer states. Evaluation on various networks for image classification and natural language modeling demonstrates that our 4-bit Shampoo achieves comparable performance to its 32-bit counterpart while being more memory-efficient.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Joint Additive Factor Models for Multiview Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is increasingly common in a wide variety of applied settings to collect data of multiple different types on the same set of samples. Our particular focus in this article is on studying relationships between such multiview features and responses. A motivating application arises in the context of precision medicine where multi-omics data are collected to correlate with clinical outcomes. It is of interest to infer dependence within and across views while combining multimodal information to improve the prediction of outcomes. The signal-to-noise ratio can vary substantially across views, motivating more nuanced statistical tools beyond standard late and early fusion. This challenge comes with the need to preserve interpretability, select features, and obtain accurate uncertainty quantification. We propose a joint additive factor regression model (JAFAR) with a structured additive design, accounting for shared and view-specific components. We ensure identifiability via a novel dependent cumulative shrinkage process (D-CUSP) prior. We provide an efficient implementation via a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler and extend our approach to allow flexible feature and outcome distributions. Prediction of time-to-labor onset from immunome, metabolome, and proteome data illustrates performance gains against state-of-the-art competitors. Our open-source software (R package) is available at https://github.com/niccoloanceschi/jafar.</description>

      <title>Are We Done with MMLU?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maybe not. We identify and analyse errors in the popular Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark. Even though MMLU is widely adopted, our analysis demonstrates numerous ground truth errors that obscure the true capabilities of LLMs. For example, we find that 57% of the analysed questions in the Virology subset contain errors. To address this issue, we introduce a comprehensive framework for identifying dataset errors using a novel error annotation protocol. Then, we create MMLU-Redux, which is a subset of 5,700 manually re-annotated questions across all 57 MMLU subjects. We estimate that 6.49% of MMLU questions contain errors. Using MMLU-Redux, we demonstrate significant discrepancies with the model performance metrics that were originally reported. Our results strongly advocate for revising MMLU's error-ridden questions to enhance its future utility and reliability as a benchmark. https://huggingface.co/datasets/edinburgh-dawg/mmlu-redux-2.0.</description>

      <title>Long Story Short: Story-level Video Understanding from 20K Short Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in vision-language models have significantly advanced video understanding. Existing datasets and tasks, however, have notable limitations. Most datasets are confined to short videos with limited events and narrow narratives. For example, datasets with instructional and egocentric videos often depict activities of one person in a single scene. Although existing movie datasets offer richer content, they are often limited to short-term tasks, lack publicly available videos, and frequently encounter data leakage issues given the use of subtitles and other information about commercial movies during LLM pretraining. To address the above limitations, we propose Short-Films 20K (SF20K), the largest publicly available movie dataset. SF20K is composed of 20,143 amateur films and offers long-term video tasks in the form of multiple-choice and open-ended question answering. Our extensive analysis of SF20K reveals minimal data leakage, emphasizes the need for long-term reasoning, and demonstrates the strong performance of recent VLMs. Finally, we show that instruction tuning on the SF20K-Train set substantially improves model performance, paving the way for future progress in long-term video understanding.</description>

      <title>Advances in Diffusion Models for Image Data Augmentation: A Review of Methods, Models, Evaluation Metrics and Future Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image data augmentation constitutes a critical methodology in modern computer vision tasks, since it can facilitate towards enhancing the diversity and quality of training datasets; thereby, improving the performance and robustness of machine learning models in downstream tasks. In parallel, augmentation approaches can also be used for editing/modifying a given image in a context- and semantics-aware way. Diffusion Models (DMs), which comprise one of the most recent and highly promising classes of methods in the field of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), have emerged as a powerful tool for image data augmentation, capable of generating realistic and diverse images by learning the underlying data distribution. The current study realizes a systematic, comprehensive and in-depth review of DM-based approaches for image augmentation, covering a wide range of strategies, tasks and applications. In particular, a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental principles, model architectures and training strategies of DMs is initially performed. Subsequently, a taxonomy of the relevant image augmentation methods is introduced, focusing on techniques regarding semantic manipulation, personalization and adaptation, and application-specific augmentation tasks. Then, performance assessment methodologies and respective evaluation metrics are analyzed. Finally, current challenges and future research directions in the field are discussed.</description>

      <title>DiReCT: Diagnostic Reasoning for Clinical Notes via Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable capabilities, spanning a wide range of tasks and applications, including those in the medical domain. Models like GPT-4 excel in medical question answering but may face challenges in the lack of interpretability when handling complex tasks in real clinical settings. We thus introduce the diagnostic reasoning dataset for clinical notes (DiReCT), aiming at evaluating the reasoning ability and interpretability of LLMs compared to human doctors. It contains 511 clinical notes, each meticulously annotated by physicians, detailing the diagnostic reasoning process from observations in a clinical note to the final diagnosis. Additionally, a diagnostic knowledge graph is provided to offer essential knowledge for reasoning, which may not be covered in the training data of existing LLMs. Evaluations of leading LLMs on DiReCT bring out a significant gap between their reasoning ability and that of human doctors, highlighting the critical need for models that can reason effectively in real-world clinical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Masked Image Modeling: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we survey recent studies on masked image modeling (MIM), an approach that emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning technique in computer vision. The MIM task involves masking some information, e.g.~pixels, patches, or even latent representations, and training a model, usually an autoencoder, to predicting the missing information by using the context available in the visible part of the input. We identify and formalize two categories of approaches on how to implement MIM as a pretext task, one based on reconstruction and one based on contrastive learning. Then, we construct a taxonomy and review the most prominent papers in recent years. We complement the manually constructed taxonomy with a dendrogram obtained by applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We further identify relevant clusters via manually inspecting the resulting dendrogram. Our review also includes datasets that are commonly used in MIM research. We aggregate the performance results of various masked image modeling methods on the most popular datasets, to facilitate the comparison of competing methods. Finally, we identify research gaps and propose several interesting directions of future work. We supplement our survey with the following public repository containing organized references: https://github.com/vladhondru25/MIM-Survey.</description>

      <title>FMRFT: Fusion Mamba and DETR for Query Time Sequence Intersection Fish Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early detection of abnormal fish behavior caused by disease or hunger can be achieved through fish tracking using deep learning techniques, which holds significant value for industrial aquaculture. However, underwater reflections and some reasons with fish, such as the high similarity, rapid swimming caused by stimuli and mutual occlusion bring challenges to multi-target tracking of fish. To address these challenges, this paper establishes a complex multi-scenario sturgeon tracking dataset and introduces the FMRFT model, a real-time end-to-end fish tracking solution. The model incorporates the low video memory consumption Mamba In Mamba (MIM) architecture, which facilitates multi-frame temporal memory and feature extraction, thereby addressing the challenges to track multiple fish across frames. Additionally, the FMRFT model with the Query Time Sequence Intersection (QTSI) module effectively manages occluded objects and reduces redundant tracking frames using the superior feature interaction and prior frame processing capabilities of RT-DETR. This combination significantly enhances the accuracy and stability of fish tracking. Trained and tested on the dataset, the model achieves an IDF1 score of 90.3% and a MOTA accuracy of 94.3%. Experimental results show that the proposed FMRFT model effectively addresses the challenges of high similarity and mutual occlusion in fish populations, enabling accurate tracking in factory farming environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Transferable Features for Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have demonstrated success in a variety of applications, including inverse problems and neural rendering. An INR is typically trained to capture one signal of interest, resulting in learned neural features that are highly attuned to that signal. Assumed to be less generalizable, we explore the aspect of transferability of such learned neural features for fitting similar signals. We introduce a new INR training framework, STRAINER that learns transferrable features for fitting INRs to new signals from a given distribution, faster and with better reconstruction quality. Owing to the sequential layer-wise affine operations in an INR, we propose to learn transferable representations by sharing initial encoder layers across multiple INRs with independent decoder layers. At test time, the learned encoder representations are transferred as initialization for an otherwise randomly initialized INR. We find STRAINER to yield extremely powerful initialization for fitting images from the same domain and allow for $\approx +10dB$ gain in signal quality early on compared to an untrained INR itself. STRAINER also provides a simple way to encode data-driven priors in INRs. We evaluate STRAINER on multiple in-domain and out-of-domain signal fitting tasks and inverse problems and further provide detailed analysis and discussion on the transferability of STRAINER's features.

      <title>Two Stage Segmentation of Cervical Tumors using PocketNet</title>

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common malignancy amongst women worldwide.1 Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) serves as the mainstay definitive treatment regimen for locally advanced cervical cancers and includes external beam radiation followed by brachytherapy.2 Integral to radiotherapy treatment planning is the routine contouring of both the target tumor at the level of the cervix, associated gynecologic anatomy and the adjacent organs at risk (OARs). However, manual contouring of these structures is both time and labor intensive and associated with known interobserver variability that can impact treatment outcomes. While multiple tools have been developed to automatically segment OARs and the high-risk clinical tumor volume (HR-CTV) using computed tomography (CT) images,3,4,5,6 the development of deep learning-based tumor segmentation tools using routine T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) addresses an unmet clinical need to improve the routine contouring of both anatomical structures and cervical cancers, thereby increasing quality and consistency of radiotherapy planning. This work applied a novel deep-learning model (PocketNet) to segment the cervix, vagina, uterus, and tumor(s) on T2w MRI. The performance of the PocketNet architecture was evaluated, when trained on data via 5-fold cross validation. PocketNet achieved a mean Dice-Sorensen similarity coefficient (DSC) exceeding 70% for tumor segmentation and 80% for organ segmentation. These results suggest that PocketNet is robust to variations in contrast protocols, providing reliable segmentation of the regions of interest.</description>

      <title>JourneyBench: A Challenging One-Stop Vision-Language Understanding Benchmark of Generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing vision-language understanding benchmarks largely consist of images of objects in their usual contexts. As a consequence, recent multimodal large language models can perform well with only a shallow visual understanding by relying on background language biases. Thus, strong performance on these benchmarks does not necessarily correlate with strong visual understanding. In this paper, we release JourneyBench, a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark of generated images designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five tasks: complementary multimodal chain of thought, multi-image VQA, imaginary image captioning, VQA with hallucination triggers, and fine-grained retrieval with sample-specific distractors. Unlike existing benchmarks, JourneyBench explicitly requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on JourneyBench and analyze performance along a number of fine-grained dimensions. Results across all five tasks show that JourneyBench is exceptionally challenging for even the best models, indicating that models' visual reasoning abilities are not as strong as they first appear. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose avenues for further research.</description>

      <title>Takin-VC: Expressive Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via Adaptive Hybrid Content Encoding and Enhanced Timbre Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Expressive zero-shot voice conversion (VC) is a critical and challenging task that aims to transform the source timbre into an arbitrary unseen speaker while preserving the original content and expressive qualities. Despite recent progress in zero-shot VC, there remains considerable potential for improvements in speaker similarity and speech naturalness. Moreover, existing zero-shot VC systems struggle to fully reproduce paralinguistic information in highly expressive speech, such as breathing, crying, and emotional nuances, limiting their practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose Takin-VC, a novel expressive zero-shot VC framework via adaptive hybrid content encoding and memory-augmented context-aware timbre modeling. Specifically, we introduce an innovative hybrid content encoder that incorporates an adaptive fusion module, capable of effectively integrating quantized features of the pre-trained WavLM and HybridFormer in an implicit manner, so as to extract precise linguistic features while enriching paralinguistic elements. For timbre modeling, we propose advanced memory-augmented and context-aware modules to generate high-quality target timbre features and fused representations that seamlessly align source content with target timbre. To enhance real-time performance, we advocate a conditional flow matching model to reconstruct the Mel-spectrogram of the source speech. Experimental results show that our Takin-VC consistently surpasses state-of-the-art VC systems, achieving notable improvements in terms of speech naturalness, speech expressiveness, and speaker similarity, while offering enhanced inference speed.</description>

      <title>Guess What I Think: Streamlined EEG-to-Image Generation with Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating images from brain waves is gaining increasing attention due to its potential to advance brain-computer interface (BCI) systems by understanding how brain signals encode visual cues. Most of the literature has focused on fMRI-to-Image tasks as fMRI is characterized by high spatial resolution. However, fMRI is an expensive neuroimaging modality and does not allow for real-time BCI. On the other hand, electroencephalography (EEG) is a low-cost, non-invasive, and portable neuroimaging technique, making it an attractive option for future real-time applications. Nevertheless, EEG presents inherent challenges due to its low spatial resolution and susceptibility to noise and artifacts, which makes generating images from EEG more difficult. In this paper, we address these problems with a streamlined framework based on the ControlNet adapter for conditioning a latent diffusion model (LDM) through EEG signals. We conduct experiments and ablation studies on popular benchmarks to demonstrate that the proposed method beats other state-of-the-art models. Unlike these methods, which often require extensive preprocessing, pretraining, different losses, and captioning models, our approach is efficient and straightforward, requiring only minimal preprocessing and a few components.

      <title>Uncovering the Genetic Basis of Glioblastoma Heterogeneity through Multimodal Analysis of Whole Slide Images and RNA Sequencing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer characterized by rapid progression and poor prognosis. Despite advances in treatment, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving this aggressiveness remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed multimodal deep learning approaches to investigate glioblastoma heterogeneity using joint image/RNA-seq analysis. Our results reveal novel genes associated with glioblastoma. By leveraging a combination of whole-slide images and RNA-seq, as well as introducing novel methods to encode RNA-seq data, we identified specific genetic profiles that may explain different patterns of glioblastoma progression. These findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying glioblastoma heterogeneity and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</description>

      <title>Separating Tongue from Thought: Activation Patching Reveals Language-Agnostic Concept Representations in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central question in multilingual language modeling is whether large language models (LLMs) develop a universal concept representation, disentangled from specific languages. In this paper, we address this question by analyzing latent representations (latents) during a word translation task in transformer-based LLMs. We strategically extract latents from a source translation prompt and insert them into the forward pass on a target translation prompt. By doing so, we find that the output language is encoded in the latent at an earlier layer than the concept to be translated. Building on this insight, we conduct two key experiments. First, we demonstrate that we can change the concept without changing the language and vice versa through activation patching alone. Second, we show that patching with the mean over latents across different languages does not impair and instead improves the models' performance in translating the concept. Our results provide evidence for the existence of language-agnostic concept representations within the investigated models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)-based multi-agent paradigms for software engineering are introduced to automatically resolve software development tasks (e.g., from a given issue to source code). However, existing work is evaluated based on historical benchmark datasets, rarely considers human feedback at each stage of the automated software development process, and has not been deployed in practice. In this paper, we introduce a Human-in-the-loop LLM-based Agents framework (HULA) for software development that allows software engineers to refine and guide LLMs when generating coding plans and source code for a given task. We design, implement, and deploy the HULA framework into Atlassian JIRA for internal uses. Through a multi-stage evaluation of the HULA framework, Atlassian software engineers perceive that HULA can minimize the overall development time and effort, especially in initiating a coding plan and writing code for straightforward tasks. On the other hand, challenges around code quality remain a concern in some cases. We draw lessons learned and discuss opportunities for future work, which will pave the way for the advancement of LLM-based agents in software development.</description>

      <title>LUMIA: Linear probing for Unimodal and MultiModal Membership Inference Attacks leveraging internal LLM states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in a variety of applications, but concerns around membership inference have grown in parallel. Previous efforts focus on black-to-grey-box models, thus neglecting the potential benefit from internal LLM information. To address this, we propose the use of Linear Probes (LPs) as a method to detect Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by examining internal activations of LLMs. Our approach, dubbed LUMIA, applies LPs layer-by-layer to get fine-grained data on the model inner workings. We test this method across several model architectures, sizes and datasets, including unimodal and multimodal tasks. In unimodal MIA, LUMIA achieves an average gain of 15.71 % in Area Under the Curve (AUC) over previous techniques. Remarkably, LUMIA reaches AUC&gt;60% in 65.33% of cases -- an increment of 46.80% against the state of the art. Furthermore, our approach reveals key insights, such as the model layers where MIAs are most detectable. In multimodal models, LPs indicate that visual inputs can significantly contribute to detect MIAs -- AUC&gt;60% is reached in 85.90% of experiments.</description>

      <title>Proactive Adversarial Defense: Harnessing Prompt Tuning in Vision-Language Models to Detect Unseen Backdoored Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat by embedding hidden triggers into inputs, causing models to misclassify them into target labels. While extensive research has focused on mitigating these attacks in object recognition models through weight fine-tuning, much less attention has been given to detecting backdoored samples directly. Given the vast datasets used in training, manual inspection for backdoor triggers is impractical, and even state-of-the-art defense mechanisms fail to fully neutralize their impact. To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Experiments demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of this method, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 86% across two renowned datasets for detecting unseen backdoor triggers, establishing a new standard in backdoor defense.</description>

      <title>Towards a Multimodal Large Language Model with Pixel-Level Insight for Biomedicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have achieved notable advancements, demonstrating the feasibility of developing an intelligent biomedical assistant. However, current biomedical MLLMs predominantly focus on image-level understanding and restrict interactions to textual commands, thus limiting their capability boundaries and the flexibility of usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal large language model for the biomedical domain, named MedPLIB, which possesses pixel-level understanding. Excitingly, it supports visual question answering (VQA), arbitrary pixel-level prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes), and pixel-level grounding. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) multi-stage training strategy, which divides MoE into separate training phases for a visual-language expert model and a pixel-grounding expert model, followed by fine-tuning using MoE. This strategy effectively coordinates multitask learning while maintaining the computational cost at inference equivalent to that of a single expert model. To advance the research of biomedical MLLMs, we introduce the Medical Complex Vision Question Answering Dataset (MeCoVQA), which comprises an array of 8 modalities for complex medical imaging question answering and image region understanding. Experimental results indicate that MedPLIB has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple medical visual language tasks. More importantly, in zero-shot evaluations for the pixel grounding task, MedPLIB leads the best small and large models by margins of 19.7 and 15.6 respectively on the mDice metric. The codes, data, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ShawnHuang497/MedPLIB.</description>

      <title>Active Inference for Self-Organizing Multi-LLM Systems: A Bayesian Thermodynamic Approach to Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.</description>

      <title>On Large Language Models in Mission-Critical IT Governance: Are We Ready Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The security of critical infrastructure has been a pressing concern since the advent of computers and has become even more critical in today's era of cyber warfare. Protecting mission-critical systems (MCSs), essential for national security, requires swift and robust governance, yet recent events reveal the increasing difficulty of meeting these challenges. Aim. Building on prior research showcasing the potential of Generative AI (GAI), such as Large Language Models, in enhancing risk analysis, we aim to explore practitioners' views on integrating GAI into the governance of IT MCSs. Our goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations for stakeholders, including researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Method. We designed a survey to collect practical experiences, concerns, and expectations of practitioners who develop and implement security solutions in the context of MCSs. Conclusions and Future Works. Our findings highlight that the safe use of LLMs in MCS governance requires interdisciplinary collaboration. Researchers should focus on designing regulation-oriented models and focus on accountability; practitioners emphasize data protection and transparency, while policymakers must establish a unified AI framework with global benchmarks to ensure ethical and secure LLMs-based MCS governance.</description>

      <title>Detecting Cognitive Impairment and Psychological Well-being among Older Adults Using Facial, Acoustic, Linguistic, and Cardiovascular Patterns Derived from Remote Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aging society urgently requires scalable methods to monitor cognitive decline and identify social and psychological factors indicative of dementia risk in older adults. Our machine learning (ML) models captured facial, acoustic, linguistic, and cardiovascular features from 39 individuals with normal cognition or Mild Cognitive Impairment derived from remote video conversations and classified cognitive status, social isolation, neuroticism, and psychological well-being. Our model could distinguish Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) of 0.5 (vs. 0) with 0.78 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), social isolation with 0.75 AUC, neuroticism with 0.71 AUC, and negative affect scales with 0.79 AUC. Recent advances in machine learning offer new opportunities to remotely detect cognitive impairment and assess associated factors, such as neuroticism and psychological well-being. Our experiment showed that speech and language patterns were more useful for quantifying cognitive impairment, whereas facial expression and cardiovascular patterns using photoplethysmography (PPG) were more useful for quantifying personality and psychological well-being.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider an unconstrained stochastic optimization problem where the objective function exhibits high-order smoothness. Specifically, we propose a new stochastic first-order method (SFOM) with multi-extrapolated momentum, in which multiple extrapolations are performed in each iteration, followed by a momentum update based on these extrapolations. We demonstrate that the proposed SFOM can accelerate optimization by exploiting the high-order smoothness of the objective function $f$. Assuming that the $p$th-order derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous for some $p\ge2$, and under additional mild assumptions, we establish that our method achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-(3p+1)/p})$ for finding a point $x$ such that $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(x)\|]\le\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SFOM to leverage arbitrary-order smoothness of the objective function for acceleration, resulting in a sample complexity that improves upon the best-known results without assuming the mean-squared smoothness condition. Preliminary numerical experiments validate the practical performance of our method and support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Consistency Checks for Language Model Forecasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters instantaneously? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on arbitrage: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur can trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then build a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our (instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate with LLM forecasters' ground truth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a consistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation tool for forecasting.</description>

      <title>SepsisCalc: Integrating Clinical Calculators into Early Sepsis Prediction via Dynamic Temporal Graph Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sepsis is an organ dysfunction caused by a deregulated immune response to an infection. Early sepsis prediction and identification allow for timely intervention, leading to improved clinical outcomes. Clinical calculators (e.g., the six-organ dysfunction assessment of SOFA) play a vital role in sepsis identification within clinicians' workflow, providing evidence-based risk assessments essential for sepsis diagnosis. However, artificial intelligence (AI) sepsis prediction models typically generate a single sepsis risk score without incorporating clinical calculators for assessing organ dysfunctions, making the models less convincing and transparent to clinicians. To bridge the gap, we propose to mimic clinicians' workflow with a novel framework SepsisCalc to integrate clinical calculators into the predictive model, yielding a clinically transparent and precise model for utilization in clinical settings. Practically, clinical calculators usually combine information from multiple component variables in Electronic Health Records (EHR), and might not be applicable when the variables are (partially) missing. We mitigate this issue by representing EHRs as temporal graphs and integrating a learning module to dynamically add the accurately estimated calculator to the graphs. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on sepsis prediction tasks. Moreover, we developed a system to identify organ dysfunctions and potential sepsis risks, providing a human-AI interaction tool for deployment, which can help clinicians understand the prediction outputs and prepare timely interventions for the corresponding dysfunctions, paving the way for actionable clinical decision-making support for early intervention.</description>

      <title>MoColl: Agent-Based Specific and General Model Collaboration for Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image captioning is a critical task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications across various domains. For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.</description>

      <title>Gender Bias in Text-to-Video Generation Models: A case study of Sora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of text-to-video generation models has revolutionized content creation as it produces high-quality videos from textual prompts. However, concerns regarding inherent biases in such models have prompted scrutiny, particularly regarding gender representation. Our study investigates the presence of gender bias in OpenAI's Sora, a state-of-the-art text-to-video generation model. We uncover significant evidence of bias by analyzing the generated videos from a diverse set of gender-neutral and stereotypical prompts. The results indicate that Sora disproportionately associates specific genders with stereotypical behaviors and professions, which reflects societal prejudices embedded in its training data.</description>

      <title>Benchmark Evaluations, Applications, and Challenges of Large Vision Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a transformative technology at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, enabling machines to perceive and reason about the world through both visual and textual modalities. For example, models such as CLIP, Claude, and GPT-4V demonstrate strong reasoning and understanding abilities on visual and textual data and beat classical single modality vision models on zero-shot classification. Despite their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in applications, a comprehensive survey of existing studies on VLMs is notably lacking, particularly for researchers aiming to leverage VLMs in their specific domains. To this end, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects: model information of the major VLMs developed over the past five years (2019-2024); the main architectures and training methods of these VLMs; summary and categorization of the popular benchmarks and evaluation metrics of VLMs; the applications of VLMs including embodied agents, robotics, and video generation; the challenges and issues faced by current VLMs such as hallucination, fairness, and safety. Detailed collections including papers and model repository links are listed in https://github.com/zli12321/Awesome-VLM-Papers-And-Models.git.</description>

      <title>Balanced Multi-view Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MvC) aims to integrate information from different views to enhance the capability of the model in capturing the underlying data structures. The widely used joint training paradigm in MvC is potentially not fully leverage the multi-view information, since the imbalanced and under-optimized view-specific features caused by the uniform learning objective for all views. For instance, particular views with more discriminative information could dominate the learning process in the joint training paradigm, leading to other views being under-optimized. To alleviate this issue, we first analyze the imbalanced phenomenon in the joint-training paradigm of multi-view clustering from the perspective of gradient descent for each view-specific feature extractor. Then, we propose a novel balanced multi-view clustering (BMvC) method, which introduces a view-specific contrastive regularization (VCR) to modulate the optimization of each view. Concretely, VCR preserves the sample similarities captured from the joint features and view-specific ones into the clustering distributions corresponding to view-specific features to enhance the learning process of view-specific feature extractors. Additionally, a theoretical analysis is provided to illustrate that VCR adaptively modulates the magnitudes of gradients for updating the parameters of view-specific feature extractors to achieve a balanced multi-view learning procedure. In such a manner, BMvC achieves a better trade-off between the exploitation of view-specific patterns and the exploration of view-invariance patterns to fully learn the multi-view information for the clustering task. Finally, a set of experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art approaches both on eight benchmark MvC datasets and two spatially resolved transcriptomics datasets.</description>

      <title>VLM-driven Behavior Tree for Context-aware Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Behavior Trees (BTs) has recently gained attention in the robotics community, yet remains in its early stages of development. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interactively generate and edit BTs that address visual conditions, enabling context-aware robot operations in visually complex environments. A key feature of our approach lies in the conditional control through self-prompted visual conditions. Specifically, the VLM generates BTs with visual condition nodes, where conditions are expressed as free-form text. Another VLM process integrates the text into its prompt and evaluates the conditions against real-world images during robot execution. We validated our framework in a real-world cafe scenario, demonstrating both its feasibility and limitations.</description>

      <title>CURing Large Models: Compression via CUR Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved remarkable success but are resource-intensive, posing challenges such as memory usage. We introduce CURing, a novel model compression method based on CUR matrix decomposition, which approximates weight matrices as the product of selected columns (C) and rows (R), and a small linking matrix (U). We apply this decomposition to weights chosen based on the combined influence of their magnitudes and activations. By identifying and retaining informative rows and columns, CURing significantly reduces model size with minimal performance loss. For example, it reduces Llama3.1-8B's parameters to 7.32B (-9%) in just 129 seconds, over 20 times faster than prior compression methods.</description>

      <title>SensorQA: A Question Answering Benchmark for Daily-Life Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth in sensor data, effectively interpreting and interfacing with these data in a human-understandable way has become crucial. While existing research primarily focuses on learning classification models, fewer studies have explored how end users can actively extract useful insights from sensor data, often hindered by the lack of a proper dataset. To address this gap, we introduce SensorQA, the first human-created question-answering (QA) dataset for long-term time-series sensor data for daily life monitoring. SensorQA is created by human workers and includes 5.6K diverse and practical queries that reflect genuine human interests, paired with accurate answers derived from sensor data. We further establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art AI models on this dataset and evaluate their performance on typical edge devices. Our results reveal a gap between current models and optimal QA performance and efficiency, highlighting the need for new contributions. The dataset and code are available at: \url{https://github.com/benjamin-reichman/SensorQA}.</description>
