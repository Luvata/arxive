      <title>Standard vs. Modular Sampling: Best Practices for Reliable LLM Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -"forget" and "retain", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the forget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In privacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into neighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget targets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in existing benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general knowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and relationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic iteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto standards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically evaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single neighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure performance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an initial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to balance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods are inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level Unlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling. We demonstrate that this modular approach, combined with robust algorithms, provides a clear and stable path towards effective unlearning.</description>

      <title>Feed Two Birds with One Scone: Exploiting Function-Space Regularization for Both OOD Robustness and ID Fine-Tuning Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID) performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this, most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights, features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Graph Neural Networks against Topology Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with minimal impact on model accuracy.

      <title>Neural Breadcrumbs: Membership Inference Attacks on LLMs Through Hidden State and Attention Pattern Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only marginally better than random guessing against large language models, suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations, rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks. Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected, highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large language models.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Recommendations with Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spotify's Home page features a variety of content types, including music, podcasts, and audiobooks. However, historical data is heavily skewed toward music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page, in particular with under-represented content types such as podcasts.</description>

      <title>PLanTS: Periodicity-aware Latent-state Representation Learning for Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) are ubiquitous in domains such as healthcare, climate science, and industrial monitoring, but their high dimensionality, limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature pose significant challenges for conventional machine learning methods. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.</description>

      <title>STL-based Optimization of Biomolecular Neural Networks for Regression and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL, enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.</description>

      <title>Prior Distribution and Model Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of training data distribution on the performance of image classification models. By analyzing the embeddings of the training set, we propose a framework to understand the confidence of model predictions on unseen data without the need for retraining. Our approach filters out low-confidence predictions based on their distance from the training distribution in the embedding space, significantly improving classification accuracy. We demonstrate this on the example of several classification models, showing consistent performance gains across architectures. Furthermore, we show that using multiple embedding models to represent the training data enables a more robust estimation of confidence, as different embeddings capture complementary aspects of the data. Combining these embeddings allows for better detection and exclusion of out-of-distribution samples, resulting in further accuracy improvements. The proposed method is model-agnostic and generalizable, with potential applications beyond computer vision, including domains such as Natural Language Processing where prediction reliability is critical.</description>

      <title>MambaLite-Micro: Memory-Optimized Mamba Inference on MCUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying Mamba models on microcontrollers (MCUs) remains challenging due to limited memory, the lack of native operator support, and the absence of embedded-friendly toolchains. We present, to our knowledge, the first deployment of a Mamba-based neural architecture on a resource-constrained MCU, a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine: MambaLite-Micro. Our pipeline maps a trained PyTorch Mamba model to on-device execution by (1) exporting model weights into a lightweight format, and (2) implementing a handcrafted Mamba layer and supporting operators in C with operator fusion and memory layout optimization. MambaLite-Micro eliminates large intermediate tensors, reducing 83.0% peak memory, while maintaining an average numerical error of only 1.7x10-5 relative to the PyTorch Mamba implementation. When evaluated on keyword spotting(KWS) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks, MambaLite-Micro achieved 100% consistency with the PyTorch baselines, fully preserving classification accuracy. We further validated portability by deploying on both ESP32S3 and STM32H7 microcontrollers, demonstrating consistent operation across heterogeneous embedded platforms and paving the way for bringing advanced sequence models like Mamba to real-world resource-constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Self-Aligned Reward: Towards Effective and Efficient Reasoners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but such signals remain coarse, offering only binary correctness feedback. This limitation often results in inefficiencies, including overly verbose reasoning and high computational cost, while existing solutions often compromise accuracy. To address this, we introduce self-aligned reward (SAR), a self-guided signal that complements verifiable rewards to encourage both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. SAR is defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on the query and the standalone answer, thereby favoring responses that are concise and query-specific. Quantitative analysis reveals that SAR reliably distinguishes answer quality: concise, correct answers score higher than redundant ones, and partially correct answers score higher than entirely incorrect ones. Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows that integrating SAR with prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO improves accuracy by 4%, while reducing inference cost by 30%. Further analysis demonstrates that SAR achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness and efficiency compared to reward signals based on length or self-confidence. We also show that SAR shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning behaviors, demonstrating its ability to suppress unnecessary elaboration without losing critical reasoning. These results highlight the promise of self-aligned reward as a fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards, paving the way for more efficient and effective LLM training.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation: A Hierarchical Approach for Long-Horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) addresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the automatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level policies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a principled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these limitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level, goal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a high-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing intermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of RLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle of value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We present proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various conditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical planning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.</description>

      <title>ProfilingAgent: Profiling-Guided Agentic Reasoning for Adaptive Model Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies. Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with &lt;0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided model optimization.</description>

      <title>Causal Debiasing Medical Multimodal Representation Learning with Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints. Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself. In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization: missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and causal insights.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$ search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity scenarios verify the flexibility.</description>

      <title>DQS: A Low-Budget Query Strategy for Enhancing Unsupervised Data-driven Anomaly Detection Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an active learning-based threshold is recommended.</description>

      <title>GraMFedDHAR: Graph Based Multimodal Differentially Private Federated HAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.</description>

      <title>Distributed Deep Learning using Stochastic Gradient Staleness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the notable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex tasks, the training process still remains considerable challenges. A primary obstacle is the substantial time required for training, particularly as high performing DNNs tend to become increasingly deep (characterized by a larger number of hidden layers) and require extensive training datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed training method that integrates two prominent strategies for accelerating deep learning: data parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm. By utilizing multiple computational units operating in parallel, the proposed approach enhances the amount of training data processed in each iteration while mitigating locking issues commonly associated with the backpropagation algorithm. These features collectively contribute to significant improvements in training efficiency. The proposed distributed training method is rigorously proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through empirical evaluations, wherein an DNN is trained to perform classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.</description>

      <title>Morphological Perceptron with Competitive Layer: Training Using Convex-Concave Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A morphological perceptron is a multilayer feedforward neural network in which neurons perform elementary operations from mathematical morphology. For multiclass classification tasks, a morphological perceptron with a competitive layer (MPCL) is obtained by integrating a winner-take-all output layer into the standard morphological architecture. The non-differentiability of morphological operators renders gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable for training such networks. Consequently, alternative strategies that do not depend on gradient information are commonly adopted. This paper proposes the use of the convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training MPCL networks. The training problem is formulated as a difference of convex (DC) functions and solved iteratively using CCP, resulting in a sequence of linear programming subproblems. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training method in addressing classification tasks with MPCL networks.</description>

      <title>Simulation Priors for Data-Efficient Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do we enable AI systems to efficiently learn in the real-world? First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning. This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Offline vs. Online Learning in Model-based RL: Lessons for Data Collection Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents, offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on expert data alone.</description>

      <title>Ensemble of Precision-Recall Curve (PRC) Classification Trees with Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection underpins critical applications from network security and intrusion detection to fraud prevention, where recognizing aberrant patterns rapidly is indispensable. Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC) classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest (PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods, affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy forecasting is vital for grid reliability and operational efficiency. Although recent advances in time series forecasting have led to progress, existing benchmarks remain limited in spatial and temporal scope and lack multi-energy features. This raises concerns about their reliability and applicability in real-world deployment. To address this, we present the Real-E dataset, covering over 74 power stations across 30+ European countries over a 10-year span with rich metadata. Using Real- E, we conduct an extensive data analysis and benchmark over 20 baselines across various model types. We introduce a new metric to quantify shifts in correlation structures and show that existing methods struggle on our dataset, which exhibits more complex and non-stationary correlation dynamics. Our findings highlight key limitations of current methods and offer a strong empirical basis for building more robust forecasting models</description>

      <title>DCV-ROOD Evaluation Framework: Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework. This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast convergence to the true performance.</description>

      <title>Select, then Balance: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Exogenous-Aware Spatio-Temporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in \underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select, then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>time2time: Causal Intervention in Hidden States to Simulate Rare Events in Time Series Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period) during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts: injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks. Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically grounded representations are a robust property of large time series transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for strategic stress-testing.</description>

      <title>Simple Optimizers for Convex Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely recognized in modern machine learning practice that access to a diverse set of tasks can enhance performance across those tasks. This observation suggests that, unlike in general multi-objective optimization, the objectives in many real-world settings may not be inherently conflicting. To address this, prior work introduced the Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization (AMOO) framework and proposed gradient-based algorithms with provable convergence guarantees. However, existing analysis relies on strong assumptions, particularly strong convexity, which implies the existence of a unique optimal solution. In this work, we relax this assumption and study gradient-descent algorithms for convex AMOO under standard smoothness or Lipschitz continuity conditions-assumptions more consistent with those used in deep learning practice. This generalization requires new analytical tools and metrics to characterize convergence in the convex AMOO setting. We develop such tools, propose scalable algorithms for convex AMOO, and establish their convergence guarantees. Additionally, we prove a novel lower bound that demonstrates the suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to our methods.</description>

      <title>Performance of Conformal Prediction in Capturing Aleatoric Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.</description>

      <title>Finetuning LLMs for Human Behavior Prediction in Social Science Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful opportunity to simulate the results of social science experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that finetuning LLMs directly on individual-level responses from past experiments meaningfully improves the accuracy of such simulations across diverse social science domains. We construct SocSci210 via an automatic pipeline, a dataset comprising 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants in 210 open-source social science experiments. Through finetuning, we achieve multiple levels of generalization. In completely unseen studies, our strongest model, Socrates-Qwen-14B, produces predictions that are 26% more aligned with distributions of human responses to diverse outcome questions under varying conditions relative to its base model (Qwen2.5-14B), outperforming GPT-4o by 13%. By finetuning on a subset of conditions in a study, generalization to new unseen conditions is particularly robust, improving by 71%. Since SocSci210 contains rich demographic information, we reduce demographic parity, a measure of bias, by 10.6% through finetuning. Because social sciences routinely generate rich, topic-specific datasets, our findings indicate that finetuning on such data could enable more accurate simulations for experimental hypothesis screening. We release our data, models and finetuning code at stanfordhci.github.io/socrates.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Robust Aggregation in Decentralized Gradient Marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning has sparked interest in decentralized gradient marketplaces, where participants trade intermediate artifacts like gradients. However, existing Federated Learning (FL) benchmarks overlook critical economic and systemic factors unique to such marketplaces-cost-effectiveness, fairness to sellers, and market stability-especially when a buyer relies on a private baseline dataset for evaluation.
  We introduce a comprehensive benchmark framework to holistically evaluate robust gradient aggregation methods within these buyer-baseline-reliant marketplaces. Our contributions include: (1) a simulation environment modeling marketplace dynamics with a variable buyer baseline and diverse seller distributions; (2) an evaluation methodology augmenting standard FL metrics with marketplace-centric dimensions such as Economic Efficiency, Fairness, and Selection Dynamics; (3) an in-depth empirical analysis of the existing Distributed Gradient Marketplace framework, MartFL, including the integration and comparative evaluation of adapted FLTrust and SkyMask as alternative aggregation strategies within it. This benchmark spans diverse datasets, local attacks, and Sybil attacks targeting the marketplace selection process; and (4) actionable insights into the trade-offs between model performance, robustness, cost, fairness, and stability.
  This benchmark equips the community with essential tools and empirical evidence to evaluate and design more robust, equitable, and economically viable decentralized gradient marketplaces.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stochastic Modeling Using Autoregressive Sequence Models: Translating Event Tables to Queueing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While queueing network models are powerful tools for analyzing service systems, they traditionally require substantial human effort and domain expertise to construct. To make this modeling approach more scalable and accessible, we propose a data-driven framework for queueing network modeling and simulation based on autoregressive sequence models trained on event-stream data. Instead of explicitly specifying arrival processes, service mechanisms, or routing logic, our approach learns the conditional distributions of event types and event times, recasting the modeling task as a problem of sequence distribution learning. We show that Transformer-style architectures can effectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction of high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework on event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual evaluation. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and the growing availability of data, our framework takes a step toward more automated, data-driven modeling pipelines to support broader adoption of queueing network models across service domains.</description>

      <title>The Measure of Deception: An Analysis of Data Forging in Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by privacy regulations and the need to mitigate the effects of harmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they effectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning is forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target point, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing information. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data points whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance $\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a framework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural networks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on the order of $\epsilon$, and when $\epsilon$ is small enough, $\epsilon^d$. More generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging set measure decays as $\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and $r&lt;d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients. Extensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the same asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing that, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly sampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence that adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning claims can, in principle, be detected.</description>

      <title>Learning to Construct Knowledge through Sparse Reference Selection with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific literature makes it increasingly difficult to acquire new knowledge, particularly in specialized domains where reasoning is complex, full-text access is restricted, and target references are sparse among a large set of candidates. We present a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for sparse reference selection that emulates human knowledge construction, prioritizing which papers to read under limited time and cost. Evaluated on drug--gene relation discovery with access restricted to titles and abstracts, our approach demonstrates that both humans and machines can construct knowledge effectively from partial information.</description>

      <title>SPINN: An Optimal Self-Supervised Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks. Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.</description>

      <title>X-SQL: Expert Schema Linking and Understanding of Text-to-SQL with Multi-LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With Large Language Models' (LLMs) emergent abilities on code generation tasks, Text-to-SQL has become one of the most popular downstream applications. Despite the strong results of multiple recent LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks, the research community often overlooks the importance of database schema information for generating high-quality SQL queries. We find that such schema information plays a significant or even dominant role in the Text-to-SQL task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel database schema expert with two components. We first introduce X-Linking, an LLM Supervised Finetuning (SFT)-based method that achieves superior Schema Linking results compared to existing open-source Text-to-SQL methods. In addition, we innovatively propose an X-Admin component that focuses on Schema Understanding by bridging the gap between abstract schema information and the user's natural language question. Aside from better learning with schema information, we experiment with Multi-LLMs for different components within the system to further boost its performance. By incorporating these techniques into our end-to-end framework, X-SQL, we have achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on the Spider-Dev dataset and 82.5% on the Spider-Test dataset. This outstanding performance establishes X-SQL as the leading Text-to-SQL framework based on open-source models.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking: Robust and Learning-Augmented Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT) problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.</description>

      <title>Unified Interaction Foundational Model (UIFM) for Predicting Complex User and System Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications, e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying "grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.</description>

      <title>PolicyEvolve: Evolving Programmatic Policies by LLMs for multi-player games via Population-Based Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency. Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules: Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner</description>

      <title>ARIES: Relation Assessment and Model Recommendation for Deep Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns, restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.</description>

      <title>A Surrogate model for High Temperature Superconducting Magnets to Predict Current Distribution with Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite element method (FEM) is widely used in high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets, but its computational cost increases with magnet size and becomes time-consuming for meter-scale magnets, especially when multi-physics couplings are considered, which limits the fast design of large-scale REBCO magnet systems. In this work, a surrogate model based on a fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the space-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets were generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes. The results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture achieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN), with the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer providing the most favorable balance between training accuracy and generalization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can reliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range, with maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several orders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when training costs are included. These results indicate that the proposed FCRN-based surrogate model provides both accuracy and efficiency, offering a promising tool for the rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.</description>

      <title>Teaching Precommitted Agents: Model-Free Policy Evaluation and Control in Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounted MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-inconsistent preferences, where agents favor smaller-sooner over larger-later rewards, are a key feature of human and animal decision-making. Quasi-Hyperbolic (QH) discounting provides a simple yet powerful model for this behavior, but its integration into the reinforcement learning (RL) framework has been limited. This paper addresses key theoretical and algorithmic gaps for precommitted agents with QH preferences. We make two primary contributions: (i) we formally characterize the structure of the optimal policy, proving for the first time that it reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form; and (ii) we design the first practical, model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation and Q-learning in this setting, both with provable convergence guarantees. Our results provide foundational insights for incorporating QH preferences in RL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beginning with text and images, generative AI has expanded to audio, video, computer code, and molecules. Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making. We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models implement it.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Time-Dependent PDE Surrogates: Graph Neural Simulators vs Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance. Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate models for time-dependent PDEs.</description>

      <title>Tracking daily paths in home contexts with RSSI fingerprinting based on UWB through deep learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of human activity recognition has evolved significantly, driven largely by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) device technology, particularly in personal devices. This study investigates the use of ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for tracking inhabitant paths in home environments using deep learning models. UWB technology estimates user locations via time-of-flight and time-difference-of-arrival methods, which are significantly affected by the presence of walls and obstacles in real environments, reducing their precision. To address these challenges, we propose a fingerprinting-based approach utilizing received signal strength indicator (RSSI) data collected from inhabitants in two flats (60 m2 and 100 m2) while performing daily activities. We compare the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, as well as the use of Bluetooth technology. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of the type and duration of the temporal window (future, past, or a combination of both). Our results demonstrate a mean absolute error close to 50 cm, highlighting the superiority of the hybrid model in providing accurate location estimates, thus facilitating its application in daily human activity recognition in residential settings.</description>

      <title>An Improved Template for Approximate Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks - i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area. We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Exploring Urban Factors with Autoencoders: Relationship Between Static and Dynamic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges, visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while separate ones are useful in particular cases.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Language Model for Personalized Lung Cancer Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate risk assessment in lung cancer screening is critical for enabling early cancer detection and minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures. The Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the standard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless, Lung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it stratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without incorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model (RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for individualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study including dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes significant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the national lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation task into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors, and synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven system equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and monitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby facilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning in the Game Of Hidden Rules (GOHR) environment, a complex puzzle in which an agent must infer and execute hidden rules to clear a 6$\times$6 board by placing game pieces into buckets. We explore two state representation strategies, namely Feature-Centric (FC) and Object-Centric (OC), and employ a Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm for training. The agent has access only to partial observations and must simultaneously infer the governing rule and learn the optimal policy through experience. We evaluate our models across multiple rule-based and trial-list-based experimental setups, analyzing transfer effects and the impact of representation on learning efficiency.</description>

      <title>Metric Embedding Initialization-Based Differentially Private and Explainable Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph clustering under the framework of differential privacy, which aims to process graph-structured data while protecting individual privacy, has been receiving increasing attention. Despite significant achievements in current research, challenges such as high noise, low efficiency and poor interpretability continue to severely constrain the development of this field. In this paper, we construct a differentially private and interpretable graph clustering approach based on metric embedding initialization. Specifically, we construct an SDP optimization, extract the key set and provide a well-initialized clustering configuration using an HST-based initialization method. Subsequently, we apply an established k-median clustering strategy to derive the cluster results and offer comparative explanations for the query set through differences from the cluster centers. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods in various clustering metrics while strictly ensuring privacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning enables models to learn new classes over time without storing data from old ones. As multimodal graph-structured data becomes increasingly prevalent, existing methods struggle with challenges like catastrophic forgetting, distribution bias, memory limits, and weak generalization. We propose MCIGLE, a novel framework that addresses these issues by extracting and aligning multimodal graph features and applying Concatenated Recursive Least Squares for effective knowledge retention. Through multi-channel processing, MCIGLE balances accuracy and memory preservation. Experiments on public datasets validate its effectiveness and generalizability.</description>

      <title>UrbanMIMOMap: A Ray-Traced MIMO CSI Dataset with Precoding-Aware Maps and Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) systems require environment-aware communication, driven by native artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Radio maps (RMs), providing spatially continuous channel information, are key enablers. However, generating high-fidelity RM ground truth via electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally intensive, motivating machine learning (ML)-based RM construction. The effectiveness of these data-driven methods depends on large-scale, high-quality training data. Current public datasets often focus on single-input single-output (SISO) and limited information, such as path loss, which is insufficient for advanced multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems requiring detailed channel state information (CSI). To address this gap, this paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel large-scale urban MIMO CSI dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing. UrbanMIMOMap offers comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid, going beyond traditional path loss data. This rich CSI is vital for constructing high-fidelity RMs and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM generation, including deep learning. We demonstrate the dataset's utility through baseline performance evaluations of representative ML methods for RM construction. This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research in high-precision RM generation, MIMO spatial performance, and ML for 6G environment awareness. The code and data for this work are available at: https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/UrbanMIMOMap.</description>

      <title>IPR: Intelligent Prompt Routing with User-Controlled Quality-Cost Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the strongest model in the Claude family and processes requests with sub-150ms latency.</description>

      <title>RecMind: LLM-Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Personalized Consumer Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalization is a core capability across consumer technologies, streaming, shopping, wearables, and voice, yet it remains challenged by sparse interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. We present RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\% (Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late fusion and LLM-only variants.</description>

      <title>A Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks Approach for Predicting Silent Data Corruption inducing Circuit-Level Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream electronic design automation flows.</description>

      <title>LoaQ: Layer-wise Output Approximation Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each component's quantized output to match its original. Layer-wise post-training quantization (PTQ), though based on this idea, adopts a strictly local view and can achieve, at best, only activation-aware approximations of weights. As a result, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations from this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate approximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ, but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics of mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution, making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and weight-activation joint quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.</description>

      <title>WindFM: An Open-Source Foundation Model for Zero-Shot Wind Power Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/WindFM.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Efficiency of Latent Spaces via the Coupling-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact, interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality. We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse. Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C) can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.</description>

      <title>Text-Trained LLMs Can Zero-Shot Extrapolate PDE Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning (ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting. Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically grounded predictions.</description>

      <title>Exploring approaches to computational representation and classification of user-generated meal logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examined the use of machine learning and domain specific enrichment on patient generated health data, in the form of free text meal logs, to classify meals on alignment with different nutritional goals. We used a dataset of over 3000 meal records collected by 114 individuals from a diverse, low income community in a major US city using a mobile app. Registered dietitians provided expert judgement for meal to goal alignment, used as gold standard for evaluation. Using text embeddings, including TFIDF and BERT, and domain specific enrichment information, including ontologies, ingredient parsers, and macronutrient contents as inputs, we evaluated the performance of logistic regression and multilayer perceptron classifiers using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score against the gold standard and self assessment. Even without enrichment, ML outperformed self assessments of individuals who logged meals, and the best performing combination of ML classifier with enrichment achieved even higher accuracies. In general, ML classifiers with enrichment of Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients information performed well across multiple nutritional goals, but there was variability in the impact of enrichment and classification algorithm on accuracy of classification for different nutritional goals. In conclusion, ML can utilize unstructured free text meal logs and reliably classify whether meals align with specific nutritional goals, exceeding self assessments, especially when incorporating nutrition domain knowledge. Our findings highlight the potential of ML analysis of patient generated health data to support patient centered nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.</description>

      <title>A Fragile Number Sense: Probing the Elemental Limits of Numerical Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought, limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical insights.</description>

      <title>Ban&amp;Pick: Achieving Free Performance Gains and Inference Speedup via Smarter Routing in MoE-LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&amp;Pick, a post-training, plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Ban&amp;Pick delivers free performance gains and inference acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from 65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the vLLM.</description>

      <title>Breaking SafetyCore: Exploring the Risks of On-Device AI Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to hardware and software improvements, an increasing number of AI models are deployed on-device. This shift enhances privacy and reduces latency, but also introduces security risks distinct from traditional software. In this article, we examine these risks through the real-world case study of SafetyCore, an Android system service incorporating sensitive image content detection. We demonstrate how the on-device AI model can be extracted and manipulated to bypass detection, effectively rendering the protection ineffective. Our analysis exposes vulnerabilities of on-device AI models and provides a practical demonstration of how adversaries can exploit them.</description>

      <title>Variational Garrote for Statistical Physics-based Sparse and Robust Variable Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting key variables from high-dimensional data is increasingly important in the era of big data. Sparse regression serves as a powerful tool for this purpose by promoting model simplicity and explainability. In this work, we revisit a valuable yet underutilized method, the statistical physics-based Variational Garrote (VG), which introduces explicit feature selection spin variables and leverages variational inference to derive a tractable loss function. We enhance VG by incorporating modern automatic differentiation techniques, enabling scalable and efficient optimization. We evaluate VG on both fully controllable synthetic datasets and complex real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that VG performs especially well in highly sparse regimes, offering more consistent and robust variable selection than Ridge and LASSO regression across varying levels of sparsity. We also uncover a sharp transition: as superfluous variables are admitted, generalization degrades abruptly and the uncertainty of the selection variables increases. This transition point provides a practical signal for estimating the correct number of relevant variables, an insight we successfully apply to identify key predictors in real-world data. We expect that VG offers strong potential for sparse modeling across a wide range of applications, including compressed sensing and model pruning in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Pre-Service Horizon: Infusing In-Service Behavior for Improved Financial Risk Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately. This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation (abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced, including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Resource Allocation in Interference-limited Multi-Channel Wireless Networks with QoS Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically. However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios. Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE (eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point. Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained resource allocation in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>NeuroDeX: Unlocking Diverse Support in Decompiling Deep Neural Network Executables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-device deep learning models have extensive real world demands. Deep learning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment on edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse engineering. Previous studies have attempted to decompile DNN executables, but they face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing quantized compiled models. In this paper, we present NeuroDeX to unlock diverse support in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately and efficiently perform operator type recognition, operator attribute recovery and model reconstruction. NeuroDeX can recover DNN executables into high-level models towards compilation optimizations, different architectures and quantized compiled models. We conduct experiments on 96 DNN executables across 12 common DNN models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NeuroDeX can decompile non-quantized executables into nearly identical high-level models. NeuroDeX can recover functionally similar high-level models for quantized executables, achieving an average top-1 accuracy of 72%. NeuroDeX offers a more comprehensive and effective solution compared to previous DNN executables decompilers.</description>

      <title>CAPMix: Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection Based on Abnormal Assumptions with Dual-Space Mixup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task, particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated training data.

      <title>CAME-AB: Cross-Modality Attention with Mixture-of-Experts for Antibody Binding Site Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities, including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes are available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CAME-AB-C525</description>

      <title>DyC-STG: Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network for Real-time Data Credibility Analysis in IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical, event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of up to 0.930.</description>

      <title>A machine-learned expression for the excess Gibbs energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and chemistry, providing a basis for modeling the thermodynamic properties of liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures solely from the molecular structures of their components is a long-standing challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating physical laws as hard constraints within a flexible neural network. The resulting model, HANNA, was trained end-to-end on an extensive experimental dataset for binary mixtures from the Dortmund Data Bank, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent predictions. A novel surrogate solver developed in this work enabled the inclusion of liquid-liquid equilibrium data in the training process. Furthermore, a geometric projection method was applied to enable robust extrapolations to multi-component mixtures, without requiring additional parameters. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in accuracy and scope. The trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive interface is provided on our website, MLPROP.</description>

      <title>On optimal solutions of classical and sliced Wasserstein GANs with non-Gaussian data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian. To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original (unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve the same performance while requiring less computational resources.</description>

      <title>QualityFM: a Multimodal Physiological Signal Foundation Model with Self-Distillation for Signal Quality Challenges in Critically Ill Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality, leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function, which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks: false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and ECG signals.</description>

      <title>Lane Change Intention Prediction of two distinct Populations using a Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a result of the growing importance of lane change intention prediction for a safe and efficient driving experience in complex driving scenarios, researchers have in recent years started to train novel machine learning algorithms on available datasets with promising results. A shortcoming of this recent research effort, though, is that the vast majority of the proposed algorithms are trained on a single datasets. In doing so, researchers failed to test if their algorithm would be as effective if tested on a different dataset and, by extension, on a different population with respect to the one on which they were trained. In this article we test a transformer designed for lane change intention prediction on two datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and Hong Kong. We found that the transformer's accuracy plummeted when tested on a population different to the one it was trained on with accuracy values as low as 39.43%, but that when trained on both populations simultaneously it could achieve an accuracy as high as 86.71%. - This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

      <title>Learning Optimal Defender Strategies for CAGE-2 using a POMDP Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CAGE-2 is an accepted benchmark for learning and evaluating defender strategies against cyberattacks. It reflects a scenario where a defender agent protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy. Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the learned defender strategy and the required training time.</description>

      <title>Predicting Fetal Outcomes from Cardiotocography Signals Using a Supervised Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder (VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy outcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning approaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on five-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes. The model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction, incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC) constraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared error (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination, latent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model achieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level, where predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned with model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were less strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised decompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates that supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular, multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling physiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as ECG. Although full interpretability was not achieved, the model supports clinically useful outcome prediction and provides a basis for future interpretable, generative models.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Self-Supervised Network Intrusion Detection using Augmented Negative Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity. While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing self-supervised models.</description>

      <title>Tackling Device Data Distribution Real-time Shift via Prototype-based Parameter Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based, backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix, facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and generality.</description>

      <title>AI for Scientific Discovery is a Social Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet its benefits remain unevenly distributed. While technical obstacles such as scarce data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computation are significant, we argue that the primary barriers are social and institutional. Narratives that defer progress to speculative "AI scientists," the undervaluing of data and infrastructure contributions, misaligned incentives, and gaps between domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for technical progress.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Bounds and Task-Centric Learning Complexity for Real-World Dynamic Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bounds for Graph Convolutional Networks on Inductive Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.</description>

      <title>Demo: Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO) for Patient Summarization in Molecular Tumor Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary, typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon, or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.</description>

      <title>Small Vectors, Big Effects: A Mechanistic Study of RL-Induced Reasoning via Steering Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language-model computations remain poorly understood. We study lightweight steering vectors inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a reinforcement-learning objective, which can match full fine-tuning performance while retaining the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses, we analyze two models and find: (i) the last-layer steering vector behaves like a token-substitution bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens such as "To" and "Step"; and (ii) the penultimate-layer steering vector leaves attention patterns largely unchanged and instead acts through the MLP and unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols. These results establish a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral changes induced by reasoning training.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Generalization of Graph Anomaly Detection: From Transfer Learning to Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications. To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire future research in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>BEAM: Brainwave Empathy Assessment Model for Early Childhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation. Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's prosocial development.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning for Stabilizing Near-Shortest Path Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple algorithm that needs only a few data samples from a single graph for learning local routing policies that generalize across a rich class of geometric random graphs in Euclidean metric spaces. We thus solve the all-pairs near-shortest path problem by training deep neural networks (DNNs) that let each graph node efficiently and scalably route (i.e., forward) packets by considering only the node's state and the state of the neighboring nodes. Our algorithm design exploits network domain knowledge in the selection of input features and design of the policy function for learning an approximately optimal policy. Domain knowledge also provides theoretical assurance that the choice of a ``seed graph'' and its node data sampling suffices for generalizable learning. Remarkably, one of these DNNs we train -- using distance-to-destination as the only input feature -- learns a policy that exactly matches the well-known Greedy Forwarding policy, which forwards packets to the neighbor with the shortest distance to the destination. We also learn a new policy, which we call GreedyTensile routing -- using both distance-to-destination and node stretch as the input features -- that almost always outperforms greedy forwarding. We demonstrate the explainability and ultra-low latency run-time operation of Greedy Tensile routing by symbolically interpreting its DNN in low-complexity terms of two linear actions.</description>

      <title>Group Effect Enhanced Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning for Individual Travel Behavior Modeling under Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial for urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy, generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable behavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).</description>

      <title>TrajAware: Graph Cross-Attention and Trajectory-Aware for Generalisable VANETs under Partial Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Barycentric Neural Networks and Length-Weighted Persistent Entropy Loss: A Green Geometric and Topological Framework for Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are \emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains, many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$), is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their \emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters. We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of \emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly \emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and log-cosh.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Latent Agentic Substructures in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications for alignment in agentic AI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating realistic financial time series is essential for stress testing, scenario generation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Despite advances in deep generative models, there is no consensus metric for their evaluation. We focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its computation, achieving substantial speedups over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>RT-HCP: Dealing with Inference Delays and Sample Efficiency to Learn Directly on Robotic Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning a controller directly on the robot requires extreme sample efficiency. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency FURUTA pendulum platform. Code: github.com/elasriz/RTHCP</description>

      <title>Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</description>

      <title>Aligning Large Vision-Language Models by Deep Reinforcement Learning and Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or multimodal large language models represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling systems to understand and generate content across both visual and textual modalities. While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress, fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs, highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Message Passing for Addressing Oversquashing in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes. Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task. Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY and Peptides-struct, respectively.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Value Learner for Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on these challenges, we propose a Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss for value learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Physics-informed HIQL (Pi-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale navigation tasks.</description>

      <title>\texttt{R$^\textbf{2}$AI}: Towards Resistant and Resilient AI in an Evolving World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this position paper, we address the persistent gap between rapidly growing AI capabilities and lagging safety progress. Existing paradigms divide into ``Make AI Safe'', which applies post-hoc alignment and guardrails but remains brittle and reactive, and ``Make Safe AI'', which emphasizes intrinsic safety but struggles to address unforeseen risks in open-ended environments. We therefore propose \textit{safe-by-coevolution} as a new formulation of the ``Make Safe AI'' paradigm, inspired by biological immunity, in which safety becomes a dynamic, adversarial, and ongoing learning process. To operationalize this vision, we introduce \texttt{R$^2$AI} -- \textit{Resistant and Resilient AI} -- as a practical framework that unites resistance against known threats with resilience to unforeseen risks. \texttt{R$^2$AI} integrates \textit{fast and slow safe models}, adversarial simulation and verification through a \textit{safety wind tunnel}, and continual feedback loops that guide safety and capability to coevolve. We argue that this framework offers a scalable and proactive path to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing both near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks as AI advances toward AGI and ASI.</description>

      <title>floq: Training Critics via Flow-Matching for Scaling Compute in Value-Based RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD) methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq (flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching, typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly 1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures, highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces PyFair, a formal framework for evaluating and verifying individual fairness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By adapting the concolic testing tool PyCT, we generate fairness-specific path constraints to systematically explore DNN behaviors. Our key innovation is a dual network architecture that enables comprehensive fairness assessments and provides completeness guarantees for certain network types. We evaluate PyFair on 25 benchmark models, including those enhanced by existing bias mitigation techniques. Results demonstrate PyFair's efficacy in detecting discriminatory instances and verifying fairness, while also revealing scalability challenges for complex models. This work advances algorithmic fairness in critical domains by offering a rigorous, systematic method for fairness testing and verification of pre-trained DNNs.</description>

      <title>AxelSMOTE: An Agent-Based Oversampling Algorithm for Imbalanced Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed datasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling techniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several drawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls, limit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To overcome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based approach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex interactions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE implements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve correlations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for meaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic interpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting. Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Not All Samples Are Equal: Quantifying Instance-level Difficulty in Targeted Data Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose an increasingly serious threat due to their ease of deployment and high success rates. These attacks aim to manipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models. Unlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance, targeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This threat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test samples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate how attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key characteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and poison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning attacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for vulnerability assessment and understanding data poisoning attacks.</description>

Abstract: Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable component of modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially in safety-critical applications where models must identify inputs from unfamiliar classes not seen during training. While OOD detection has been extensively studied in the machine learning literature--with both post hoc and training-based approaches--its effectiveness under noisy training labels remains underexplored. Recent studies suggest that label noise can significantly degrade OOD performance, yet principled solutions to this issue are lacking. In this work, we demonstrate that directly combining existing label noise-robust methods with OOD detection strategies is insufficient to address this critical challenge. To overcome this, we propose a robust OOD detection framework that integrates loss correction techniques from the noisy label learning literature with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art OOD detection techniques, particularly under severe noisy label settings.</description>

      <title>Staying in the Sweet Spot: Responsive Reasoning Evolution via Capability-Adaptive Hint Scaffolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy. Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint (part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5 points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Neutron Reflectometry by Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density, roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g. lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines. Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein, automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning words in groups: fusion algebras, tensor ranks and grokking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a simple two-layer neural network with standard activation functions can learn an arbitrary word operation in any finite group, provided sufficient width is available and exhibits grokking while doing so. To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe the problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is typically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this tensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate representations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out many components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable surrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank implementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to approximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple multiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank implementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient matrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on the mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient descent.</description>

      <title>From Noise to Narrative: Tracing the Origins of Hallucinations in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science, business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic quantification of a model's hallucination risk.</description>

      <title>Outcome-based Exploration for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL, which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation, where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and (ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration, which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Multi-EuP, a new multilingual benchmark dataset, comprising 22K multi-lingual documents collected from the European Parliament, spanning 24 languages. This dataset is designed to investigate fairness in a multilingual information retrieval (IR) context to analyze both language and demographic bias in a ranking context. It boasts an authentic multilingual corpus, featuring topics translated into all 24 languages, as well as cross-lingual relevance judgments. Furthermore, it offers rich demographic information associated with its documents, facilitating the study of demographic bias. We report the effectiveness of Multi-EuP for benchmarking both monolingual and multilingual IR. We also conduct a preliminary experiment on language bias caused by the choice of tokenization strategy.</description>

      <title>Are LLM Agents Behaviorally Coherent? Latent Profiles for Social Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim, social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to (a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>Predicting Brain Morphogenesis via Physics-Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain morphology is shaped by genetic and mechanical factors and is linked to biological development and diseases. Its fractal-like features, regional anisotropy, and complex curvature distributions hinder quantitative insights in medical inspections. Recognizing that the underlying elastic instability and bifurcation share the same physics as simple geometries such as spheres and ellipses, we developed a physics-transfer learning framework to address the geometrical complexity. To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we constructed a digital library of high-fidelity continuum mechanics modeling that both describes and predicts the developmental processes of brain growth and disease. The physics of nonlinear elasticity from simple geometries is embedded into a neural network and applied to brain models. This physics-transfer approach demonstrates remarkable performance in feature characterization and morphogenesis prediction, highlighting the pivotal role of localized deformation in dominating over the background geometry. The data-driven framework also provides a library of reduced-dimensional evolutionary representations that capture the essential physics of the highly folded cerebral cortex. Validation through medical images and domain expertise underscores the deployment of digital-twin technology in comprehending the morphological complexity of the brain.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Integration with Reinforcement Learning to Augment Decision-Making in Autonomous Cyber Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential for autonomous decision-making in the cybersecurity domain, enabling agents to learn through direct environment interaction. However, RL agents in Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) typically learn from scratch, requiring them to execute undesirable actions to learn their consequences. In this study, we integrate external knowledge in the form of a Large Language Model (LLM) pretrained on cybersecurity data that our RL agent can directly leverage to make informed decisions. By guiding initial training with an LLM, we improve baseline performance and reduce the need for exploratory actions with obviously negative outcomes. We evaluate our LLM-integrated approach in a simulated cybersecurity environment, and demonstrate that our guided agent achieves over 2x higher rewards during early training and converges to a favorable policy approximately 4,500 episodes faster than the baseline.</description>

      <title>VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA), effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration. This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection". VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features, together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD, through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and potentially more effective.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Offloading for Large Language Models in 6G Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G vehicular networks promises unprecedented advancements in intelligent transportation systems. However, offloading LLM computations from vehicles to edge infrastructure poses significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive user data. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving offloading framework for LLM-integrated vehicular networks. We introduce a hybrid approach combining federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) techniques to protect user data while maintaining LLM performance. Our framework includes a privacy-aware task partitioning algorithm that optimizes the trade-off between local and edge computation, considering both privacy constraints and system efficiency. We also propose a secure communication protocol for transmitting model updates and aggregating results across the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves 75\% global accuracy with only a 2-3\% reduction compared to non-privacy-preserving methods, while maintaining DP guarantees with an optimal privacy budget of $\varepsilon = 0.8$. The framework shows stable communication overhead of approximately 2.1MB per round with computation comprising over 90\% of total processing time, validating its efficiency for resource-constrained vehicular environments.</description>

      <title>Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses (or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC, which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs, offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance comparable to ORC.</description>

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1 score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than other approaches using the same datasets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free, path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to text-to-image editing tasks.

      <title>Ensembling Membership Inference Attacks Against Tabular Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have emerged as a principled framework for auditing the privacy of synthetic data generated by tabular generative models, where many diverse methods have been proposed that each exploit different privacy leakage signals. However, in realistic threat scenarios, an adversary must choose a single method without a priori guarantee that it will be the empirically highest performing option. We study this challenge as a decision theoretic problem under uncertainty and conduct the largest synthetic data privacy benchmark to date. Here, we find that no MIA constitutes a strictly dominant strategy across a wide variety of model architectures and dataset domains under our threat model. Motivated by these findings, we propose ensemble MIAs and show that unsupervised ensembles built on individual attacks offer empirically more robust, regret-minimizing strategies than individual attacks.</description>

      <title>Self-Driving Laboratory Optimizes the Lower Critical Solution Temperature of Thermoresponsive Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome the inherent inefficiencies of traditional trial-and-error materials discovery, the scientific community is increasingly developing autonomous laboratories that integrate data-driven decision-making into closed-loop experimental workflows. In this work, we realize this concept for thermoresponsive polymers by developing a low-cost, "frugal twin" platform for the optimization of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). Our system integrates robotic fluid-handling, on-line sensors, and Bayesian optimization (BO) that navigates the multi-component salt solution spaces to achieve user-specified LCST targets. The platform demonstrates convergence to target properties within a minimal number of experiments. It strategically explores the parameter space, learns from informative "off-target" results, and self-corrects to achieve the final targets. By providing an accessible and adaptable blueprint, this work lowers the barrier to entry for autonomous experimentation and accelerates the design and discovery of functional polymers.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Networks for Continuous Control via End-to-End Model-Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for classification, their application to continuous motor control remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that fully spiking architectures can be trained end-to-end to control robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom in continuous environments. Our predictive-control framework combines Leaky Integrate-and-Fire dynamics with surrogate gradients, jointly optimizing a forward model for dynamics prediction and a policy network for goal-directed action. We evaluate this approach on both a planar 2D reaching task and a simulated 6-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that SNNs can achieve stable training and accurate torque control, establishing their viability for high-dimensional motor tasks. An extensive ablation study highlights the role of initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization in shaping training dynamics. We conclude that while stable and effective control can be achieved, recurrent spiking networks remain highly sensitive to hyperparameter settings, underscoring the importance of principled design choices.</description>

      <title>Beyond ROUGE: N-Gram Subspace Features for LLM Hallucination Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics, such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.</description>

      <title>AI-in-the-Loop: Privacy Preserving Real-Time Scam Detection and Conversational Scambaiting by Leveraging LLMs and Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing, impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.</description>

      <title>Long-Horizon Visual Imitation Learning via Plan and Code Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence, which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.</description>

      <title>Murphys Laws of AI Alignment: Why the Gap Always Wins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support. Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure, Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.</description>

      <title>RoboBallet: Planning for Multi-Robot Reaching with Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning under spatio-temporal constraints remain computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales. Existing multi-arm systems deployed in the industry rely on human intuition and experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on procedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and scalability of our planner also open the door to new capabilities such as fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning, where rapid adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.</description>

      <title>Unmasking COVID-19 Vulnerability in Nigeria: Mapping Risks Beyond Urban Hotspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges in Nigeria's public health systems since the first case reported on February 27, 2020. This study investigates key factors that contribute to state vulnerability, quantifying them through a composite risk score integrating population density (weight 0.2), poverty (0.4), access to healthcare (0.3), and age risk (0.1), adjusted by normalized case rates per 100,000. States were categorized into low-, medium-, and high-density areas to analyze trends and identify hotspots using geographic information system (GIS) mapping. The findings reveal that high-density urban areas, such as Lagos, accounting for 35.4% of national cases, had the highest risk scores (Lagos: 673.47 vs. national average: 28.16). These results align with global and local studies on the spatial variability of COVID-19 in Nigeria, including international frameworks such as the CDC Social Vulnerability Index. Google Trends data highlight variations in public health awareness, serving as a supplementary analysis to contextualize vulnerability. The risk score provides a prioritization tool for policymakers to allocate testing, vaccines, and healthcare resources to high-risk areas, though data gaps and rural underreporting call for further research. This framework can extend to other infectious diseases, offering lessons for future pandemics in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Advanced Brain Tumor Segmentation Using EMCAD: Efficient Multi-scale Convolutional Attention Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is a critical pre-processing step in the medical image analysis pipeline that involves precise delineation of tumor regions from healthy brain tissue in medical imaging data, particularly MRI scans. An efficient and effective decoding mechanism is crucial in brain tumor segmentation especially in scenarios with limited computational resources. However these decoding mechanisms usually come with high computational costs. To address this concern EMCAD a new efficient multi-scale convolutional attention decoder designed was utilized to optimize both performance and computational efficiency for brain tumor segmentation on the BraTs2020 dataset consisting of MRI scans from 369 brain tumor patients. The preliminary result obtained by the model achieved a best Dice score of 0.31 and maintained a stable mean Dice score of 0.285 plus/minus 0.015 throughout the training process which is moderate. The initial model maintained consistent performance across the validation set without showing signs of over-fitting.</description>

      <title>Direct-Scoring NLG Evaluators Can Use Pairwise Comparisons Too</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level} performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval (\textbf{+0.03}), TopicalChat (\textbf{-0.03}), and HANNA (\textbf{+0.05}) meta-evaluation benchmarks, and release the synthetic in-context summaries as data to facilitate future work.</description>

      <title>FAVAE-Effective Frequency Aware Latent Tokenizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Distributed Link Sparsification for Scalable Scheduling Using Graph Neural Networks (Journal Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wireless networks characterized by dense connectivity, the significant signaling overhead generated by distributed link scheduling algorithms can exacerbate issues like congestion, energy consumption, and radio footprint expansion. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a distributed link sparsification scheme employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to reduce scheduling overhead for delay-tolerant traffic while maintaining network capacity. A GNN module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for individual links based on traffic statistics and network topology, enabling links to withdraw from scheduling contention when they are unlikely to succeed. Our approach is facilitated by a novel offline constrained {unsupervised} learning algorithm capable of balancing two competing objectives: minimizing scheduling overhead while ensuring that total utility meets the required level. In simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, our link sparsification technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces radio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous regolith excavation is a cornerstone of in-situ resource utilization for a sustained human presence beyond Earth. However, this task is fundamentally hindered by the complex interaction dynamics of granular media and the operational need for robots to use diverse tools. To address these challenges, this work introduces a framework where a model-based reinforcement learning agent learns within a parallelized simulation. This environment leverages high-fidelity particle physics and procedural generation to create a vast distribution of both lunar terrains and excavation tool geometries. To master this diversity, the agent learns an adaptive interaction strategy by dynamically modulating its own stiffness and damping at each control step through operational space control. Our experiments demonstrate that training with a procedural distribution of tools is critical for generalization and enables the development of sophisticated tool-aware behavior. Furthermore, we show that augmenting the agent with visual feedback significantly improves task success. These results represent a validated methodology for developing the robust and versatile autonomous systems required for the foundational tasks of future space missions.</description>

      <title>Biomedical Literature Q&amp;A System Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a Biomedical Literature Question Answering (Q&amp;A) system based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, designed to improve access to accurate, evidence-based medical information. Addressing the shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed articles, curated Q&amp;A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1), show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized medical AI systems.</description>

      <title>Causal Multi-fidelity Surrogate Forward and Inverse Models for ICF Implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continued progress in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) requires solving inverse problems relating experimental observations to simulation input parameters, followed by design optimization. However, such high dimensional dynamic PDE-constrained optimization problems are extremely challenging or even intractable. It has been recently shown that inverse problems can be solved by only considering certain robust features. Here we consider the ICF capsule's deuterium-tritium (DT) interface, and construct a causal, dynamic, multifidelity reduced-order surrogate that maps from a time-dependent radiation temperature drive to the interface's radius and velocity dynamics. The surrogate targets an ODE embedding of DT interface dynamics, and is constructed by learning a controller for a base analytical model using low- and high-fidelity simulation training data with respect to radiation energy group structure. After demonstrating excellent accuracy of the surrogate interface model, we use machine learning (ML) models with surrogate-generated data to solve inverse problems optimizing radiation temperature drive to reproduce observed interface dynamics. For sparse snapshots in time, the ML model further characterizes the most informative times at which to sample dynamics. Altogether we demonstrate how operator learning, causal architectures, and physical inductive bias can be integrated to accelerate discovery, design, and diagnostics in high-energy-density systems.</description>

      <title>Cryo-EM as a Stochastic Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) enables high-resolution imaging of biomolecules, but structural heterogeneity remains a major challenge in 3D reconstruction. Traditional methods assume a discrete set of conformations, limiting their ability to recover continuous structural variability. In this work, we formulate cryo-EM reconstruction as a stochastic inverse problem (SIP) over probability measures, where the observed images are modeled as the push-forward of an unknown distribution over molecular structures via a random forward operator. We pose the reconstruction problem as the minimization of a variational discrepancy between observed and simulated image distributions, using statistical distances such as the KL divergence and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The resulting optimization is performed over the space of probability measures via a Wasserstein gradient flow, which we numerically solve using particles to represent and evolve conformational ensembles. We validate our approach using synthetic examples, including a realistic protein model, which demonstrates its ability to recover continuous distributions over structural states. We analyze the connection between our formulation and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approaches, which can be interpreted as instances of the discretize-then-optimize (DTO) framework. We further provide a consistency analysis, establishing conditions under which DTO methods, such as MAP estimation, converge to the solution of the underlying infinite-dimensional continuous problem. Beyond cryo-EM, the framework provides a general methodology for solving SIPs involving random forward operators.</description>

      <title>On detection probabilities of link invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the detection rate of n-crossing alternating links by link invariants insensitive to oriented mutation decays exponentially in n, implying that they detect alternating links with probability zero. This phenomenon applies broadly, in particular to quantum invariants such as the Jones or HOMFLYPT polynomials. We also use a big data approach to analyze several borderline cases (e.g. integral Khovanov or HOMFLYPT homologies), where our arguments almost, but not quite, apply, and we provide evidence that they too exhibit the same asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Cross-Service Threat Intelligence in LLM Services using Privacy-Preserving Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries.
  We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94, significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline, while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared to dense embeddings.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Optimal Alignment of Acoustic and Linguistic Representations for Knowledge Transfer in ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric: while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR performance.</description>

      <title>Systematic Evaluation of Multi-modal Approaches to Complex Player Profile Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern adaptive games require nuanced player understanding, yet most models use simplified 5-10 category taxonomies that fail to capture diversity. Behavioral clustering cannot distinguish players with different motivations who act similarly. We present a systematic evaluation of multi-modal classification at scale, combining behavioral telemetry with semantic context to support 36 player profiles. Using 19,413 gameplay sessions from an AI-controlled text-based RPG, we compared behavioral-only baselines with multi-modal approaches that integrate action sequences and semantic descriptions. Traditional clustering achieved only 10% accuracy for 36-category classification, limited by semantic conflation where opposite actions produced identical features. Our multi-modal LSTM processing action-text pairs improved accuracy to 21%, showing both potential and limits of non-conversational data. Analysis by behavioral complexity revealed that non-neutral profiles reached 42% accuracy (15x above random), while neutral profiles dropped to 25% (9x above random). Identical actions such as "help the merchant" cannot reveal whether a player is neutral or strategically waiting. Without access to reasoning, even multi-modal models struggle, though above-baseline results confirm a meaningful signal. Since prediction beyond 20 categories remains unexplored, our findings establish benchmarks for complex player modeling. Behavioral data alone plateaus near 10% for 36 categories, while multi-modal integration enables 25%. For designers, this shows that personality-based adaptation requires conversational interaction, as predefined choices cannot capture intent. Our evaluation at 36-category scale offers guidance for building adaptive games that better understand their players.</description>

      <title>Audits Under Resource, Data, and Access Constraints: Scaling Laws For Less Discriminatory Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI audits play a critical role in AI accountability and safety. One branch of the law for which AI audits are particularly salient is anti-discrimination law. Several areas of anti-discrimination law implicate the "less discriminatory alternative" (LDA) requirement, in which a protocol (e.g., model) is defensible if no less discriminatory protocol that achieves comparable performance can be found with a reasonable amount of effort. Notably, the burden of proving an LDA exists typically falls on the claimant (the party alleging discrimination). This creates a significant hurdle in AI cases, as the claimant would seemingly need to train a less discriminatory yet high-performing model, a task requiring resources and expertise beyond most litigants. Moreover, developers often shield information about and access to their model and training data as trade secrets, making it difficult to reproduce a similar model from scratch.
  In this work, we present a procedure enabling claimants to determine if an LDA exists, even when they have limited compute, data, information, and model access. We focus on the setting in which fairness is given by demographic parity and performance by binary cross-entropy loss. As our main result, we provide a novel closed-form upper bound for the loss-fairness Pareto frontier (PF). We show how the claimant can use it to fit a PF in the "low-resource regime," then extrapolate the PF that applies to the (large) model being contested, all without training a single large model. The expression thus serves as a scaling law for loss-fairness PFs. To use this scaling law, the claimant would require a small subsample of the train/test data. Then, the claimant can fit the context-specific PF by training as few as 7 (small) models. We stress test our main result in simulations, finding that our scaling law holds even when the exact conditions of our theory do not.</description>

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation properties as tree representations.</description>

      <title>MSRFormer: Road Network Representation Learning using Multi-scale Feature Fusion of Heterogeneous Spatial Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer, MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections, which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow heterogeneity of spatial interactions.</description>

      <title>Robust variational neural posterior estimation for simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (GDP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant problem for their use on real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting tunable hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-BIND-T: Improving SLAM with Temporally Consistent Cross-Modal LiDAR Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space, with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Introduces New Poisoning Attacks Yet Makes Them More Complicated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early research into data poisoning attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrated the ease with which backdoors could be injected. More recent LLMs add step-by-step reasoning, expanding the attack surface to include the intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) and its inherent trait of decomposing problems into subproblems. Using these vectors for more stealthy poisoning, we introduce ``decomposed reasoning poison'', in which the attacker modifies only the reasoning path, leaving prompts and final answers clean, and splits the trigger across multiple, individually harmless components.
  Fascinatingly, while it remains possible to inject these decomposed poisons, reliably activating them to change final answers (rather than just the CoT) is surprisingly difficult. This difficulty arises because the models can often recover from backdoors that are activated within their thought processes. Ultimately, it appears that an emergent form of backdoor robustness is originating from the reasoning capabilities of these advanced LLMs, as well as from the architectural separation between reasoning and final answer generation.</description>

      <title>InterAct: A Large-Scale Dataset of Dynamic, Expressive and Interactive Activities between Two People in Daily Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured. InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs. Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .</description>

      <title>Automating API Documentation with LLMs: A BERTopic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developers rely on API documentation, but official sources are often lengthy, complex, or incomplete. Many turn to community-driven forums like Stack Overflow for practical insights. We propose automating the summarization of informal sources, focusing on Android APIs. Using BERTopic, we extracted prevalent topics from 3.6 million Stack Overflow posts and applied extractive summarization techniques to generate concise summaries, including code snippets. A user study with 30 Android developers assessed the summaries for coherence, relevance, informativeness, and satisfaction, showing improved productivity. Integrating formal API knowledge with community-generated content enhances documentation, making API resources more accessible and actionable work.</description>

      <title>Risk-averse Fair Multi-class Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new classification framework based on the theory of coherent risk measures and systemic risk. The proposed approach is suitable for multi-class problems when the data is noisy, scarce (relative to the dimension of the problem), and the labeling might be unreliable. In the first part of our paper, we provide the foundation of the use of systemic risk models and show how to apply it in the context of linear and kernel-based multi-class problems. More advanced formulation via a system-theoretic approach with non-linear aggregation is proposed, which leads to a two-stage stochastic programming problem. A risk-averse regularized decomposition method is designed to solve the problem. We use a popular multi-class method as a benchmark in the performance analysis of the proposed classification methods. We illustrate our ideas by proposing several generalization of that method by the use of coherent measures of risk. The viability of the proposed risk-averse methods are supported theoretically and numerically. Additionally, we demonstrate that the application of systemic risk measures facilitates enforcing fairness in classification. Analysis and experiments regarding the fairness of the proposed models are carefully conducted. For all methods, our numerical experiments demonstrate that they are robust in the presence of unreliable training data and perform better on unknown data than the methods minimizing expected classification errors. Furthermore, the performance improves when the number of classes increases.</description>

      <title>Causal Clustering for Conditional Average Treatment Effects Estimation and Subgroup Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is critical in domains such as personalized medicine, resource allocation, and policy evaluation. A central challenge lies in identifying subpopulations that respond differently to interventions, thereby enabling more targeted and effective decision-making. While clustering methods are well-studied in unsupervised learning, their integration with causal inference remains limited. We propose a novel framework that clusters individuals based on estimated treatment effects using a learned kernel derived from causal forests, revealing latent subgroup structures. Our approach consists of two main steps. First, we estimate debiased Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) using orthogonalized learners via the Robinson decomposition, yielding a kernel matrix that encodes sample-level similarities in treatment responsiveness. Second, we apply kernelized clustering to this matrix to uncover distinct, treatment-sensitive subpopulations and compute cluster-level average CATEs. We present this kernelized clustering step as a form of regularization within the residual-on-residual regression framework. Through extensive experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, supported by ablation studies and exploratory analyses, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in capturing meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Vector-based loss functions for turbulent flow field inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When developing scientific machine learning (ML) approaches, it is often beneficial to embed knowledge of the physical system in question into the training process. One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific characteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid velocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete points in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or computational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data is ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the mean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation. Therefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical characteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector similarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here and implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting problem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in PIV images. The intention is for the inpainting task to pose a significant challenge for the ML models in order to shed light on their capabilities. The test case uses PIV data from the highly turbulent flow in the well-known Transparent Combustion Chamber III (TCC-III) engine. Loss functions based on the cosine similarity and vector magnitude differences are proposed; the results show that the vector-based loss functions lead to significantly improved predictions of multi-scale flow patterns, while a hybrid (vector and mean-square error) loss function enables a good compromise to be found between preserving multi-scale behaviour and pixel-wise accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spectral Methods in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes offer a unified introduction to spectral methods for the study of complex systems. They are intended as an operative manual rather than a theorem-proof textbook: the emphasis is on tools, identities, and perspectives that can be readily applied across disciplines. Beginning with a compendium of matrix identities and inversion techniques, the text develops the connections between spectra, dynamics, and structure in finite-dimensional systems. Applications range from dynamical stability and random walks on networks to input-output economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, memristive circuits, synchronization phenomena, and financial stability. Throughout, the guiding principle is that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and resolvent operators provide a common language linking problems in physics, mathematics, computer science, and beyond. The presentation is informal, accessible to advanced undergraduates, yet broad enough to serve as a reference for researchers interested in spectral approaches to complex systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fourier Neural Operator-Plasma Fluid Model for Fast and Accurate Multiscale Simulations of High Power Microwave Breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and simulation of High Power Microwave (HPM) breakdown, a multiscale phenomenon, is computationally expensive and requires solving Maxwell's equations (EM solver) coupled with a plasma continuity equation (plasma solver). In this work, we present a hybrid modeling approach that combines the accuracy of a differential equation-based plasma fluid solver with the computational efficiency of FNO (Fourier Neural Operator) based EM solver. Trained on data from an in-house FDTD-based plasma-fluid solver, the FNO replaces computationally expensive EM field updates, while the plasma solver governs the dynamic plasma response. The hybrid model is validated on microwave streamer formation, due to diffusion ionization mechanism, in a 2D scenario for unseen incident electric fields corresponding to entirely new plasma streamer simulations not included in model training, showing excellent agreement with FDTD based fluid simulations in terms of streamer shape, velocity, and temporal evolution. This hybrid FNO based strategy delivers significant acceleration of the order of 60X compared to traditional simulations for the specified problem size and offers an efficient alternative for computationally demanding multiscale and multiphysics simulations involved in HPM breakdown. Our work also demonstrate how such hybrid pipelines can be used to seamlessly to integrate existing C-based simulation codes with Python-based machine learning frameworks for simulations of plasma science and engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Volatility Modeling via EWMA-Driven Time-Dependent Hurst Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model featuring a variance-driven exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) time-dependent Hurst parameter $H_t$, fundamentally distinct from recent machine learning and wavelet-based approaches in the literature. Our framework pioneers a unified rough differential equation (RDE) formulation grounded in rough path theory, where the Hurst parameter dynamically adapts to evolving volatility regimes through a continuous EWMA mechanism tied to instantaneous variance. Unlike discrete model-switching or computationally intensive forecasting methods, our approach provides mathematical tractability while capturing volatility clustering and roughness bursts. We rigorously establish existence and uniqueness of solutions via rough path theory and derive martingale properties. Empirical validation on diverse asset classes including equities, cryptocurrencies, and commodities demonstrates superior performance in capturing dynamics and out-of-sample pricing accuracy. Our results show significant improvements over traditional constant-Hurst models.</description>

      <title>Fisher Random Walk: Automatic Debiasing Contextual Preference Inference for Large Language Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for rigorous and scalable evaluation of large language models, we study contextual preference inference for pairwise comparison functionals of context-dependent preference score functions across domains. Focusing on the contextual Bradley-Terry-Luce model, we develop a semiparametric efficient estimator that automates the debiased estimation through aggregating weighted residual balancing terms across the comparison graph. We show that the efficiency is achieved when the weights are derived from a novel strategy called Fisher random walk. We also propose a computationally feasible method to compute the weights by a potential representation of nuisance weight functions. We show our inference procedure is valid for general score function estimators accommodating the practitioners' need to implement flexible deep learning methods. We extend the procedure to multiple hypothesis testing using a Gaussian multiplier bootstrap that controls familywise error and to distributional shift via a cross-fitted importance-sampling adjustment for target-domain inference. Numerical studies, including language model evaluations under diverse contexts, corroborate the accuracy, efficiency, and practical utility of our method.</description>

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is essential in probabilistic machine learning models, particularly for assessing the reliability of predictions. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for estimating both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in probabilistic models. We focus on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models and employ scalable Random Fourier Features-based Gaussian Processes to approximate predictive distributions efficiently. We derive a theoretical formulation for UQ, propose a Monte Carlo sampling-based estimation method, and conduct experiments to evaluate the impact of uncertainty estimation. Our results provide insights into the sources of predictive uncertainty and illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in quantifying the confidence in the predictions.</description>

      <title>Let's Roleplay: Examining LLM Alignment in Collaborative Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and correctness of task outcomes.</description>

      <title>Near Real-Time Dust Aerosol Detection with 3D Convolutional Neural Networks on MODIS Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based models may further sharpen edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework combining quantum computation with sequential decision-making, and applications to the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem have been reported. The graph bandit problem extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithm for best-arm identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification (QSBAI). The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural restrictions. We analyze complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum algorithms for decision-making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliable identification of magnetic ground states remains a major challenge in high-throughput materials databases, where density functional theory (DFT) workflows often converge to ferromagnetic (FM) solutions. Here, we partially address this challenge by developing machine learning classifiers trained on experimentally validated MAGNDATA magnetic materials leveraging a limited number of simple compositional, structural, and electronic descriptors sourced from the Materials Project database. Our propagation vector classifiers achieve accuracies above 92%, outperforming recent studies in reliably distinguishing zero from nonzero propagation vector structures, and exposing a systematic ferromagnetic bias inherent to the Materials Project database for more than 7,843 materials. In parallel, LightGBM and XGBoost models trained directly on the Materials Project labels achieve accuracies of 84-86% (with macro F1 average scores of 63-66%), which proves useful for large-scale screening for magnetic classes, if refined by MAGNDATA-trained classifiers. These results underscore the role of machine learning techniques as corrective and exploratory tools, enabling more trustworthy databases and accelerating progress toward the identification of materials with various properties.</description>

      <title>ALPHA: LLM-Enabled Active Learning for Human-Free Network Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network log data analysis plays a critical role in detecting security threats and operational anomalies. Traditional log analysis methods for anomaly detection and root cause analysis rely heavily on expert knowledge or fully supervised learning models, both of which require extensive labeled data and significant human effort. To address these challenges, we propose ALPHA, the first Active Learning Pipeline for Human-free log Analysis. ALPHA integrates semantic embedding, clustering-based representative sampling, and large language model (LLM)-assisted few-shot annotation to automate the anomaly detection process. The LLM annotated labels are propagated across clusters, enabling large-scale training of an anomaly detector with minimal supervision. To enhance the annotation accuracy, we propose a two-step few-shot refinement strategy that adaptively selects informative prompts based on the LLM's observed error patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world log datasets demonstrate that ALPHA achieves detection accuracy comparable to fully supervised methods while mitigating human efforts in the loop. ALPHA also supports interpretable analysis through LLM-driven root cause explanations in the post-detection stage. These capabilities make ALPHA a scalable and cost-efficient solution for truly automated log-based anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Code2MCP: A Multi-Agent Framework for Automated Transformation of Code Repositories into Model Context Protocol Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05941</link>

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a significant integration challenge in the AI agent ecosystem, often called the "$N \times M$ problem," where N models require custom integrations for M tools. This fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services. This is especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the world's largest collection of functional code. This paper introduces Code2MCP, a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Our system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and deployment. A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop "Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and repair the code it generates. Code2MCP produces not only deployable services but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool integration. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/MCP-Github-Agent.</description>

      <title>Imagining Alternatives: Towards High-Resolution 3D Counterfactual Medical Image Generation via Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure. Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning. Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels, each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification, segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian cuisine.

      <title>DCMI: A Differential Calibration Membership Inference Attack Against Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively reduces hallucinations by integrating external knowledge bases, it introduces vulnerabilities to membership inference attacks (MIAs), particularly in systems handling sensitive data. Existing MIAs targeting RAG's external databases often rely on model responses but ignore the interference of non-member-retrieved documents on RAG outputs, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose DCMI, a differential calibration MIA that mitigates the negative impact of non-member-retrieved documents. Specifically, DCMI leverages the sensitivity gap between member and non-member retrieved documents under query perturbation. It generates perturbed queries for calibration to isolate the contribution of member-retrieved documents while minimizing the interference from non-member-retrieved documents. Experiments under progressively relaxed assumptions show that DCMI consistently outperforms baselines--for example, achieving 97.42% AUC and 94.35% Accuracy against the RAG system with Flan-T5, exceeding the MBA baseline by over 40%. Furthermore, on real-world RAG platforms such as Dify and MaxKB, DCMI maintains a 10%-20% advantage over the baseline. These results highlight significant privacy risks in RAG systems and emphasize the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We appeal to the community's consideration of deeper investigations, like ours, against the data leakage risks in rapidly evolving RAG systems.

      <title>BranchGRPO: Stable and Efficient GRPO with Structured Branching in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment. However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.</description>

      <title>Using Reinforcement Learning to Optimize the Global and Local Crossing Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to graph drawing based on reinforcement learning for minimizing the global and the local crossing number, that is, the total number of edge crossings and the maximum number of crossings on any edge, respectively. In our framework, an agent learns how to move a vertex based on a given observation vector in order to optimize its position. The agent receives feedback in the form of local reward signals tied to crossing reduction. To generate an initial layout, we use a stress-based graph-drawing algorithm. We compare our method against force- and stress-based (baseline) algorithms as well as three established algorithms for global crossing minimization on a suite of benchmark graphs. The experiments show mixed results: our current algorithm is mainly competitive for the local crossing number. We see a potential for further development of the approach in the future.</description>

      <title>Additive Distributionally Robust Ranking and Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ranking and selection (R&amp;S) aims to identify the alternative with the best mean performance among $k$ simulated alternatives. The practical value of R&amp;S depends on accurate simulation input modeling, which often suffers from the curse of input uncertainty due to limited data. Distributionally robust ranking and selection (DRR&amp;S) addresses this challenge by modeling input uncertainty via an ambiguity set of $m &gt; 1$ plausible input distributions, resulting in $km$ scenarios in total. Recent DRR&amp;S studies suggest a key structural insight: additivity in budget allocation is essential for efficiency. However, existing justifications are heuristic, and fundamental properties such as consistency and the precise allocation pattern induced by additivity remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a simple additive allocation (AA) procedure that aims to exclusively sample the $k + m - 1$ previously hypothesized critical scenarios. Leveraging boundary-crossing arguments, we establish a lower bound on the probability of correct selection and characterize the procedure's budget allocation behavior. We then prove that AA is consistent and, surprisingly, achieves additivity in the strongest sense: as the total budget increases, only $k + m - 1$ scenarios are sampled infinitely often. Notably, the worst-case scenarios of non-best alternatives may not be among them, challenging prior beliefs about their criticality. These results offer new and counterintuitive insights into the additive structure of DRR&amp;S. To improve practical performance while preserving this structure, we introduce a general additive allocation (GAA) framework that flexibly incorporates sampling rules from traditional R&amp;S procedures in a modular fashion. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed GAA procedures.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Gender and Political Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age, country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness and accountability in NLP within political contexts.</description>

Abstract: Operational hazards in Manufacturing Industrial Internet (MII) systems generate severe data outliers that cripple traditional statistical analysis. This paper proposes a novel robust regression method, DPD-Lasso, which integrates Density Power Divergence with Lasso regularization to analyze contaminated data from AI resilience experiments. We develop an efficient iterative algorithm to overcome previous computational bottlenecks. Applied to an MII testbed for Aerosol Jet Printing, DPD-Lasso provides reliable, stable performance on both clean and outlier-contaminated data, accurately quantifying hazard impacts. This work establishes robust regression as an essential tool for developing and validating resilient industrial AI systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling shopper interest broadness with entropy-driven dialogue policy in the context of arbitrarily large product catalogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems promise rich interactions for e-commerce, but balancing exploration (clarifying user needs) and exploitation (making recommendations) remains challenging, especially when deploying large language models (LLMs) with vast product catalogs. We address this challenge by modeling the breadth of user interest via the entropy of retrieval score distributions. Our method uses a neural retriever to fetch relevant items for a user query and computes the entropy of the re-ranked scores to dynamically route the dialogue policy: low-entropy (specific) queries trigger direct recommendations, whereas high-entropy (ambiguous) queries prompt exploratory questions. This simple yet effective strategy allows an LLM-driven agent to remain aware of an arbitrarily large catalog in real-time without bloating its context window.</description>

      <title>Learning in ImaginationLand: Omnidirectional Policies through 3D Generative Models (OP-Gen)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer, and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for data augmentation.</description>

      <title>Grasp-MPC: Closed-Loop Visual Grasping via Value-Guided Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grasping of diverse objects in unstructured environments remains a significant challenge. Open-loop grasping methods, effective in controlled settings, struggle in cluttered environments. Grasp prediction errors and object pose changes during grasping are the main causes of failure. In contrast, closed-loop methods address these challenges in simplified settings (e.g., single object on a table) on a limited set of objects, with no path to generalization. We propose Grasp-MPC, a closed-loop 6-DoF vision-based grasping policy designed for robust and reactive grasping of novel objects in cluttered environments. Grasp-MPC incorporates a value function, trained on visual observations from a large-scale synthetic dataset of 2 million grasp trajectories that include successful and failed attempts. We deploy this learned value function in an MPC framework in combination with other cost terms that encourage collision avoidance and smooth execution. We evaluate Grasp-MPC on FetchBench and real-world settings across diverse environments. Grasp-MPC improves grasp success rates by up to 32.6% in simulation and 33.3% in real-world noisy conditions, outperforming open-loop, diffusion policy, transformer policy, and IQL approaches.

      <title>Repeating vs. Non-Repeating FRBs: A Deep Learning Approach To Morphological Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to classify fast radio bursts (FRBs) based purely on morphology as encoded on recorded dynamic spectrum from CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We implemented transfer learning with a pretrained ConvNext architecture, exploiting its powerful feature extraction ability. ConvNext was adapted to classify dedispersed dynamic spectra (which we treat as images) of the FRBs into one of the two sub-classes, i.e., repeater and non-repeater, based on their various temporal and spectral properties and relation between the sub-pulse structures. Additionally, we also used mathematical model representation of the total intensity data to interpret the deep learning model. Upon fine-tuning the pretrained ConvNext on the FRB spectrograms, we were able to achieve high classification metrics while substantially reducing training time and computing power as compared to training a deep learning model from scratch with random weights and biases without any feature extraction ability. Importantly, our results suggest that the morphological differences between CHIME repeating and non-repeating events persist in Catalog 2 and the deep learning model leveraged these differences for classification. The fine-tuned deep learning model can be used for inference, which enables us to predict whether an FRB's morphology resembles that of repeaters or non-repeaters. Such inferences may become increasingly significant when trained on larger data sets that will exist in the near future.</description>

      <title>The Efficiency Frontier: Classical Shadows versus Quantum Footage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacing quantum and classical processors is an important subroutine in full-stack quantum algorithms. The so-called "classical shadow" method efficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states, enabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few measurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or when classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is not always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue quantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares classical shadows with ``quantum footage," which refers to direct quantum measurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of download efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For observables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical shadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is large and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large Hermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when the number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits fall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior include the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight $w$, accuracy requirement $\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\delta$. We also compare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of quantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow method becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper opens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid quantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the most suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>FineServe: Precision-Aware KV Slab and Two-Level Scheduling for Heterogeneous Precision LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have significantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models (LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with minimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However, quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation, and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing systems.</description>

      <title>PLRV-O: Advancing Differentially Private Deep Learning via Privacy Loss Random Variable Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is a standard method for enforcing privacy in deep learning, typically using the Gaussian mechanism to perturb gradient updates. However, conventional mechanisms such as Gaussian and Laplacian noise are parameterized only by variance or scale. This single degree of freedom ties the magnitude of noise directly to both privacy loss and utility degradation, preventing independent control of these two factors. The problem becomes more pronounced when the number of composition rounds T and batch size B vary across tasks, as these variations induce task-dependent shifts in the privacy-utility trade-off, where small changes in noise parameters can disproportionately affect model accuracy. To address this limitation, we introduce PLRV-O, a framework that defines a broad search space of parameterized DP-SGD noise distributions, where privacy loss moments are tightly characterized yet can be optimized more independently with respect to utility loss. This formulation enables systematic adaptation of noise to task-specific requirements, including (i) model size, (ii) training duration, (iii) batch sampling strategies, and (iv) clipping thresholds under both training and fine-tuning settings. Empirical results demonstrate that PLRV-O substantially improves utility under strict privacy constraints. On CIFAR-10, a fine-tuned ViT achieves 94.03% accuracy at epsilon approximately 0.5, compared to 83.93% with Gaussian noise. On SST-2, RoBERTa-large reaches 92.20% accuracy at epsilon approximately 0.2, versus 50.25% with Gaussian.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Framework for Particle Swarm Optimization using Landscape Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swarm intelligence algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex optimization problems across diverse domains. However, their widespread adoption is often hindered by limited transparency in how algorithmic components influence performance. This work presents a multi-faceted investigation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to further understand the key role of different topologies for better interpretability and explainability. To achieve this objective, we first develop a comprehensive landscape characterization framework using Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) to quantify problem difficulty and identify critical features affecting the optimization performance of PSO. Next, we conduct a rigorous empirical study comparing three fundamental swarm communication architectures -- Ring, Star, and Von Neumann topologies -- analysing their distinct impacts on exploration-exploitation balance, convergence behaviour, and solution quality and eventually develop an explainable benchmarking framework for PSO, to decode how swarm topologies affects information flow, diversity, and convergence. Based on this, a novel machine learning approach for automated algorithm configuration is introduced for training predictive models on extensive Area over the Convergence Curve (AOCC) data to recommend optimal settings based on problem characteristics. Through systematic experimentation across twenty four benchmark functions in multiple dimensions, we establish practical guidelines for topology selection and parameter configuration. These findings advance the development of more transparent and reliable swarm intelligence systems.

      <title>From Implicit Exploration to Structured Reasoning: Leveraging Guideline and Refinement for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks. Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: Minimax-Optimal Sparsity-Adaptive Inference for Change Points in Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new inference framework, named MOSAIC, for change-point detection in dynamic networks with the simultaneous low-rank and sparse-change structure. We establish the minimax rate of detection boundary, which relies on the sparsity of changes. We then develop an eigen-decomposition-based test with screened signals that approaches the minimax rate in theory, with only a minor logarithmic loss. For practical implementation of MOSAIC, we adjust the theoretical test by a novel residual-based technique, resulting in a pivotal statistic that converges to a standard normal distribution via the martingale central limit theorem under the null hypothesis and achieves full power under the alternative hypothesis. We also analyze the minimax rate of testing boundary for dynamic networks without the low-rank structure, which almost aligns with the results in high-dimensional mean-vector change-point inference. We showcase the effectiveness of MOSAIC and verify our theoretical results with several simulation examples and a real data application.</description>

      <title>Minimax optimal transfer learning for high-dimensional additive regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies high-dimensional additive regression under the transfer learning framework, where one observes samples from a target population together with auxiliary samples from different but potentially related regression models. We first introduce a target-only estimation procedure based on the smooth backfitting estimator with local linear smoothing. In contrast to previous work, we establish general error bounds under sub-Weibull($\alpha$) noise, thereby accommodating heavy-tailed error distributions. In the sub-exponential case ($\alpha=1$), we show that the estimator attains the minimax lower bound under regularity conditions, which requires a substantial departure from existing proof strategies. We then develop a novel two-stage estimation method within a transfer learning framework, and provide theoretical guarantees at both the population and empirical levels. Error bounds are derived for each stage under general tail conditions, and we further demonstrate that the minimax optimal rate is achieved when the auxiliary and target distributions are sufficiently close. All theoretical results are supported by simulation studies and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Low-Altitude Airspace Security: MLLM-Enabled UAV Intent Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of the low-altitude economy emphasizes the critical need for effective perception and intent recognition of non-cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The advanced generative reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) present a promising approach in such tasks. In this paper, we focus on the combination of UAV intent recognition and the MLLMs. Specifically, we first present an MLLM-enabled UAV intent recognition architecture, where the multimodal perception system is utilized to obtain real-time payload and motion information of UAVs, generating structured input information, and MLLM outputs intent recognition results by incorporating environmental information, prior knowledge, and tactical preferences. Subsequently, we review the related work and demonstrate their progress within the proposed architecture. Then, a use case for low-altitude confrontation is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of our architecture and offer valuable insights for practical system design. Finally, the future challenges are discussed, followed by corresponding strategic recommendations for further applications.</description>

      <title>Embedding Poisoning: Bypassing Safety Alignment via Embedding Semantic Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread distribution of Large Language Models (LLMs) through public platforms like Hugging Face introduces significant security challenges. While these platforms perform basic security scans, they often fail to detect subtle manipulations within the embedding layer. This work identifies a novel class of deployment phase attacks that exploit this vulnerability by injecting imperceptible perturbations directly into the embedding layer outputs without modifying model weights or input text. These perturbations, though statistically benign, systematically bypass safety alignment mechanisms and induce harmful behaviors during inference. We propose Search based Embedding Poisoning(SEP), a practical, model agnostic framework that introduces carefully optimized perturbations into embeddings associated with high risk tokens. SEP leverages a predictable linear transition in model responses, from refusal to harmful output to semantic deviation to identify a narrow perturbation window that evades alignment safeguards. Evaluated across six aligned LLMs, SEP achieves an average attack success rate of 96.43% while preserving benign task performance and evading conventional detection mechanisms. Our findings reveal a critical oversight in deployment security and emphasize the urgent need for embedding level integrity checks in future LLM defense strategies.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Framework for Colorectal Pathology Diagnosis: Integrating Histological and Colonoscopy Data in a Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset. The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.</description>

      <title>A data-driven discretized CS:GO simulation environment to facilitate strategic multi-agent planning research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in 3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior generation.</description>

      <title>MRD-LiNet: A Novel Lightweight Hybrid CNN with Gradient-Guided Unlearning for Improved Drought Stress Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management. Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification; however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters, restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings. To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical, scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.</description>

      <title>Musculoskeletal simulation of limb movement biomechanics in Drosophila melanogaster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational models are critical to advance our understanding of how neural, biomechanical, and physical systems interact to orchestrate animal behaviors. Despite the availability of near-complete reconstructions of the Drosophila melanogaster central nervous system, musculature, and exoskeleton, anatomically and physically grounded models of fly leg muscles are still missing. These models provide an indispensable bridge between motor neuron activity and joint movements. Here, we introduce the first 3D, data-driven musculoskeletal model of Drosophila legs, implemented in both OpenSim and MuJoCo simulation environments. Our model incorporates a Hill-type muscle representation based on high-resolution X-ray scans from multiple fixed specimens. We present a pipeline for constructing muscle models using morphological imaging data and for optimizing unknown muscle parameters specific to the fly. We then combine our musculoskeletal models with detailed 3D pose estimation data from behaving flies to achieve muscle-actuated behavioral replay in OpenSim. Simulations of muscle activity across diverse walking and grooming behaviors predict coordinated muscle synergies that can be tested experimentally. Furthermore, by training imitation learning policies in MuJoCo, we test the effect of different passive joint properties on learning speed and find that damping and stiffness facilitate learning. Overall, our model enables the investigation of motor control in an experimentally tractable model organism, providing insights into how biomechanics contribute to generation of complex limb movements. Moreover, our model can be used to control embodied artificial agents to generate naturalistic and compliant locomotion in simulated environments.</description>

      <title>IGAff: Benchmarking Adversarial Iterative and Genetic Affine Algorithms on Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging, especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101 datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack (AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels, and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.</description>

      <title>On the Reproducibility of "FairCLIP: Harnessing Fairness in Vision-Language Learning''</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al. (2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset. However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.</description>

      <title>Signal-Based Malware Classification Using 1D CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malware classification is a contemporary and ongoing challenge in cyber-security: modern obfuscation techniques are able to evade traditional static analysis, while dynamic analysis is too resource intensive to be deployed at a large scale. One prominent line of research addresses these limitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically reshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These images can then be classified based on their textural information using computer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware more effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D images results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise, caused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D dependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal limits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work addresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which avoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not suffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format. It is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to classify these 1D signals for improved performance. Furthermore, a bespoke 1D convolutional neural network, based on the ResNet architecture and squeeze-and-excitation layers, was developed to classify these signals and evaluated on the MalNet dataset. It was found to achieve state-of-the-art performance on binary, type, and family level classification with F1 scores of 0.874, 0.503, and 0.507, respectively, paving the way for future models to operate on the proposed signal modality.</description>

      <title>Impact of Labeling Inaccuracy and Image Noise on Tooth Segmentation in Panoramic Radiographs using Federated, Centralized and Local Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints, heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI. We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation (additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set. From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at 0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777). Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD: 1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD: 1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Robustness and accuracy of mean opinion scores with hard and soft outlier detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In subjective assessment of image and video quality, observers rate or compare selected stimuli. Before calculating the mean opinion scores (MOS) for these stimuli from the ratings, it is recommended to identify and deal with outliers that may have given unreliable ratings. Several methods are available for this purpose, some of which have been standardized. These methods are typically based on statistics and sometimes tested by introducing synthetic ratings from artificial outliers, such as random clickers. However, a reliable and comprehensive approach is lacking for comparative performance analysis of outlier detection methods. To fill this gap, this work proposes and applies an empirical worst-case analysis as a general solution. Our method involves evolutionary optimization of an adversarial black-box attack on outlier detection algorithms, where the adversary maximizes the distortion of scale values with respect to ground truth. We apply our analysis to several hard and soft outlier detection methods for absolute category ratings and show their differing performance in this stress test. In addition, we propose two new outlier detection methods with low complexity and excellent worst-case performance. Software for adversarial attacks and data analysis is available.</description>

      <title>Topological Regularization for Force Prediction in Active Particle Suspension with EGNN and Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing the dynamics of active particles, i.e., small self-propelled agents that both deform and are deformed by a fluid in which they move is a formidable problem as it requires coupling fine scale hydrodynamics with large scale collective effects. So we present a multi-scale framework that combines the three learning-driven tools to learn in concert within one pipeline. We use high-resolution Lattice Boltzmann snapshots of fluid velocity and particle stresses in a periodic box as input to the learning pipeline. the second step takes the morphology and positions orientations of particles to predict pairwise interaction forces between them with a E(2)-equivariant graph neural network that necessarily respect flat symmetries. Then, a physics-informed neural network further updates these local estimates by summing over them with a stress data using Fourier feature mappings and residual blocks that is additionally regularized with a topological term (introduced by persistent homology) to penalize unrealistically tangled or spurious connections. In concert, these stages deliver an holistic highly-data driven full force network prediction empathizing on the physical underpinnings together with emerging multi-scale structure typical for active matter.</description>

      <title>Robust and Adaptive Spectral Method for Representation Multi-Task Learning with Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation-based multi-task learning (MTL) improves efficiency by learning a shared structure across tasks, but its practical application is often hindered by contamination, outliers, or adversarial tasks. Most existing methods and theories assume a clean or near-clean setting, failing when contamination is significant. This paper tackles representation MTL with an unknown and potentially large contamination proportion, while also allowing for heterogeneity among inlier tasks. We introduce a Robust and Adaptive Spectral method (RAS) that can distill the shared inlier representation effectively and efficiently, while requiring no prior knowledge of the contamination level or the true representation dimension. Theoretically, we provide non-asymptotic error bounds for both the learned representation and the per-task parameters. These bounds adapt to inlier task similarity and outlier structure, and guarantee that RAS performs at least as well as single-task learning, thus preventing negative transfer. We also extend our framework to transfer learning with corresponding theoretical guarantees for the target task. Extensive experiments confirm our theory, showcasing the robustness and adaptivity of RAS, and its superior performance in regimes with up to 80\% task contamination.</description>

      <title>Automated Hierarchical Graph Construction for Multi-source Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), comprising diverse clinical data such as diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results, hold great promise for translational research. EHR-derived data have advanced disease prevention, improved clinical trial recruitment, and generated real-world evidence. Synthesizing EHRs across institutions enables large-scale, generalizable studies that capture rare diseases and population diversity, but remains hindered by the heterogeneity of medical codes, institution-specific terminologies, and the absence of standardized data structures. These barriers limit the interpretability, comparability, and scalability of EHR-based analyses, underscoring the need for robust methods to harmonize and extract meaningful insights from distributed, heterogeneous data. To address this, we propose MASH (Multi-source Automated Structured Hierarchy), a fully automated framework that aligns medical codes across institutions using neural optimal transport and constructs hierarchical graphs with learned hyperbolic embeddings. During training, MASH integrates information from pre-trained language models, co-occurrence patterns, textual descriptions, and supervised labels to capture semantic and hierarchical relationships among medical concepts more effectively. Applied to real-world EHR data, including diagnosis, medication, and laboratory codes, MASH produces interpretable hierarchical graphs that facilitate the navigation and understanding of heterogeneous clinical data. Notably, it generates the first automated hierarchies for unstructured local laboratory codes, establishing foundational references for downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Approximating Condorcet Ordering for Vector-valued Mathematical Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators for color images.</description>

      <title>Detection of trade in products derived from threatened species using machine learning and a smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The application can be used in real time to click images and help identify potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g. in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.</description>

      <title>Integrating Spatial and Semantic Embeddings for Stereo Sound Event Localization in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address the multimodal task of stereo sound event localization and detection with source distance estimation (3D SELD) in regular video content. 3D SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to model. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input, limiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data constraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion, which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. We perform an ablation study on the development set of the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset to assess the individual contributions of the language-aligned models and benchmark against the DCASE Task 3 baseline systems. Additionally, we detail the curation process of large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets used for model pre-training. These datasets were further expanded through left-right channel swapping augmentation. Our approach, combining extensive pre-training, model ensembling, and visual post-processing, achieved second rank in the DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 3 (Track B), underscoring the effectiveness of our method. Future work will explore the modality-specific contributions and architectural refinements.</description>

      <title>Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</description>

      <title>CogGuide: Human-Like Guidance for Zero-Shot Omni-Modal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select" cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering. Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points, demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch" reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neural ARFIMA model for forecasting BRIC exchange rates with long memory under oil shocks and policy uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of exchange rates remains a persistent challenge, particularly for emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC). These series exhibit long memory, nonlinearity, and non-stationarity properties that conventional time series models struggle to capture. Additionally, there exist several key drivers of exchange rate dynamics, including global economic policy uncertainty, US equity market volatility, US monetary policy uncertainty, oil price growth rates, and country-specific short-term interest rate differentials. These empirical complexities underscore the need for a flexible modeling framework that can jointly accommodate long memory, nonlinearity, and the influence of external drivers. To address these challenges, we propose a Neural AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (NARFIMA) model that combines the long-memory representation of ARFIMA with the nonlinear learning capacity of neural networks, while flexibly incorporating exogenous causal variables. We establish theoretical properties of the model, including asymptotic stationarity of the NARFIMA process using Markov chains and nonlinear time series techniques. We quantify forecast uncertainty using conformal prediction intervals within the NARFIMA framework. Empirical results across six forecast horizons show that NARFIMA consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models in forecasting BRIC exchange rates. These findings provide new insights for policymakers and market participants navigating volatile financial conditions. The \texttt{narfima} \textbf{R} package provides an implementation of our approach.</description>

      <title>When Secure Isn't: Assessing the Security of Machine Learning Model Sharing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of model-sharing through frameworks and dedicated hubs makes Machine Learning significantly more accessible. Despite their benefits, these tools expose users to underexplored security risks, while security awareness remains limited among both practitioners and developers. To enable a more security-conscious culture in Machine Learning model sharing, in this paper we evaluate the security posture of frameworks and hubs, assess whether security-oriented mechanisms offer real protection, and survey how users perceive the security narratives surrounding model sharing. Our evaluation shows that most frameworks and hubs address security risks partially at best, often by shifting responsibility to the user. More concerningly, our analysis of frameworks advertising security-oriented settings and complete model sharing uncovered six 0-day vulnerabilities enabling arbitrary code execution. Through this analysis, we debunk the misconceptions that the model-sharing problem is largely solved and that its security can be guaranteed by the file format used for sharing. As expected, our survey shows that the surrounding security narrative leads users to consider security-oriented settings as trustworthy, despite the weaknesses shown in this work. From this, we derive takeaways and suggestions to strengthen the security of model-sharing ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Dato: A Task-Based Programming Model for Dataflow Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent deep learning workloads increasingly push computational demand beyond what current memory systems can sustain, with many kernels stalling on data movement rather than computation. While modern dataflow accelerators incorporate on-chip streaming to mitigate off-chip bandwidth limitations, existing programming models struggle to harness these capabilities effectively. Low-level interfaces provide fine-grained control but impose significant development overhead, whereas high-level tile-based languages abstract away communication details, restricting optimization and forcing compilers to reconstruct the intended dataflow. We present Dato, a Python-embedded, task-based programming model for dataflow accelerators that elevates data communication and sharding to first-class type constructs. Developers write programs as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded inputs specified using layout types. These tasks are first mapped virtually onto the accelerator's spatial fabric, and the compiler then generates a physical mapping that respects hardware constraints. Experimental results on both AMD Ryzen AI NPU and Alveo FPGA devices demonstrate that Dato achieves high performance while significantly reducing the burden of writing optimized code. On the NPU, Dato attains up to 84% hardware utilization for GEMM and delivers a 2.81x speedup on attention kernels compared to a state-of-the-art commercial framework. On the FPGA, Dato surpasses leading frameworks in performance when generating custom systolic arrays, achieving 98% of the theoretical peak performance.</description>

      <title>Imitative Membership Inference Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a target machine learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific query instances were part of the training set. State-of-the-art MIAs rely on training hundreds of shadow models that are independent of the target model, leading to significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Imitative Membership Inference Attack (IMIA), which employs a novel imitative training technique to strategically construct a small number of target-informed imitative models that closely replicate the target model's behavior for inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IMIA substantially outperforms existing MIAs in various attack settings while only requiring less than 5% of the computational cost of state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Reward function compression facilitates goal-dependent reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents learn from rewards, but humans can uniquely assign value to novel, abstract outcomes in a goal-dependent manner. However, this flexibility is cognitively costly, making learning less efficient. Here, we propose that goal-dependent learning is initially supported by a capacity-limited working memory system. With consistent experience, learners create a "compressed" reward function (a simplified rule defining the goal) which is then transferred to long-term memory and applied automatically upon receiving feedback. This process frees up working memory resources, boosting learning efficiency. We test this theory across six experiments. Consistent with our predictions, our findings demonstrate that learning is parametrically impaired by the size of the goal space, but improves when the goal space structure allows for compression. We also find faster reward processing to correlate with better learning performance, supporting the idea that as goal valuation becomes more automatic, more resources are available for learning. We leverage computational modeling to support this interpretation. Our work suggests that efficient goal-directed learning relies on compressing complex goal information into a stable reward function, shedding light on the cognitive mechanisms of human motivation. These findings generate new insights into the neuroscience of intrinsic motivation and could help improve behavioral techniques that support people in achieving their goals.</description>

      <title>UMO: Scaling Multi-Identity Consistency for Image Customization via Matching Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However, since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching" paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity preserving.

      <title>Green Learning for STAR-RIS mmWave Systems with Implicit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems. Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption. Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL) approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.</description>

      <title>Video-Based MPAA Rating Prediction: An Attention-Driven Hybrid Architecture Using Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling, and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application, the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance across streaming platforms.</description>

      <title>Curia: A Multi-Modal Foundation Model for Radiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow, single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models (FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing 150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging. Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.</description>

      <title>COMPACT: Common-token Optimized Model Pruning Across Channels and Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While state-of-the-art background removal models excel at realistic imagery, they frequently underperform in specialized domains such as anime-style content, where complex features like hair and transparency present unique challenges. To address this limitation, we collected and annotated a custom dataset of 1,228 high-quality anime images of characters and objects, and fine-tuned the open-sourced BiRefNet model on this dataset. This resulted in marked improvements in background removal accuracy for anime-style images, increasing from 95.3% to 99.5% for our newly introduced Pixel Accuracy metric. We are open-sourcing the code, the fine-tuned model weights, as well as the dataset at: https://github.com/MatteoKartoon/BiRefNet.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning meets bioprocess control through behaviour cloning: Real-world deployment in an industrial photobioreactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of living cells as production units creates major challenges for maintaining stable and optimal bioprocess conditions, especially in open Photobioreactors (PBRs) exposed to fluctuating environments. To address this, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control approach, combined with Behavior Cloning (BC), for pH regulation in open PBR systems. This represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control strategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method begins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from trajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed by a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process dynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid offline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable of handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open PBRs. Simulation studies highlight the advantages of our method: the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) was reduced by 8% compared to PID control and by 5% relative to standard off-policy RL. Moreover, control effort decreased substantially-by 54% compared to PID and 7% compared to standard RL-an important factor for minimizing operational costs. Finally, an 8-day experimental validation under varying environmental conditions confirmed the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of RL-based methods for bioprocess control and paves the way for their broader application to other nonlinear, disturbance-prone systems.</description>

      <title>Sequential Least-Squares Estimators with Fast Randomized Sketching for Linear Statistical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel randomized framework for the estimation problem of large-scale linear statistical models, namely Sequential Least-Squares Estimators with Fast Randomized Sketching (SLSE-FRS), which integrates Sketch-and-Solve and Iterative-Sketching methods for the first time. By iteratively constructing and solving sketched least-squares (LS) subproblems with increasing sketch sizes to achieve better precisions, SLSE-FRS gradually refines the estimators of the true parameter vector, ultimately producing high-precision estimators. We analyze the convergence properties of SLSE-FRS, and provide its efficient implementation. Numerical experiments show that SLSE-FRS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method, and the Iterative Double Sketching (IDS) method.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models Is Not Effective for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks Yet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data are available at https://github.com/XuZhao0/tts-knowledge</description>

      <title>Learning spatially structured open quantum dynamics with regional-attention transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with spatial structure and external control is an important challenge in quantum information science. Classical numerical solvers for such systems require integrating coupled master and field equations, which is computationally demanding for simulation and optimization tasks and often precluding real-time use in network-scale simulations or feedback control. We introduce a regional attention-based neural architecture that learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of structured open quantum systems. The model incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as an inductive bias to achieve scalable complexity, and supports conditioning on time-dependent global control parameters. We demonstrate learning on two representative systems: a driven dissipative single qubit and an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memory. The model achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution control protocols, and provides substantial acceleration up to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers. These results demonstrate that the architecture establishes a general surrogate modeling framework for spatially structured open quantum dynamics, with immediate relevance to large-scale quantum network simulation, quantum repeater and protocol design, real-time experimental optimization, and scalable device modeling across diverse light-matter platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700 low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and low-resource languages.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their introduction by Kipf and Welling in $2017$, a primary use of graph convolutional networks is transductive node classification, where missing labels are inferred within a single observed graph and its feature matrix. Despite the widespread use of the network model, the statistical foundations of transductive learning remain limited, as standard inference frameworks typically rely on multiple independent samples rather than a single graph. In this work, we address these gaps by developing new concentration-of-measure tools that leverage the geometric regularities of large graphs via low-dimensional metric embeddings. The emergent regularities are captured using a random graph model; however, the methods remain applicable to deterministic graphs once observed. We establish two principal learning results. The first concerns arbitrary deterministic $k$-vertex graphs, and the second addresses random graphs that share key geometric properties with an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{G}(k,p)$ in the regime $p \in \mathcal{O}((\log (k)/k)^{1/2})$. The first result serves as the basis for and illuminates the second. We then extend these results to the graph convolutional network setting, where additional challenges arise. Lastly, our learning guarantees remain informative even with a few labelled nodes $N$ and achieve the optimal nonparametric rate $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ as $N$ grows.</description>

      <title>Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN): A Protocol for Trustworthy Numeric Answers from LLMs via Claim Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}. Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity: fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose \textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality, rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic, integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings: \emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-Guided Regex Filter Synthesis for Event-Based Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose HyGLAD, a novel algorithm that automatically builds a set of interpretable patterns that model event data. These patterns can then be used to detect event-based anomalies in a stationary system, where any deviation from past behavior may indicate malicious activity. The algorithm infers equivalence classes of entities with similar behavior observed from the events, and then builds regular expressions that capture the values of those entities. As opposed to deep-learning approaches, the regular expressions are directly interpretable, which also translates to interpretable anomalies. We evaluate HyGLAD against all 7 unsupervised anomaly detection methods from DeepOD on five datasets from real-world systems. The experimental results show that on average HyGLAD outperforms existing deep-learning methods while being an order of magnitude more efficient in training and inference (single CPU vs GPU). Precision improved by 1.2x and recall by 1.3x compared to the second-best baseline.</description>

      <title>Paper2Agent: Reimagining Research Papers As Interactive and Reliable AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI co-scientists.</description>

      <title>Data-driven solar forecasting enables near-optimal economic decisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar energy adoption is critical to achieving net-zero emissions. However, it remains difficult for many industrial and commercial actors to decide on whether they should adopt distributed solar-battery systems, which is largely due to the unavailability of fast, low-cost, and high-resolution irradiance forecasts. Here, we present SunCastNet, a lightweight data-driven forecasting system that provides 0.05$^\circ$, 10-minute resolution predictions of surface solar radiation downwards (SSRD) up to 7 days ahead. SunCastNet, coupled with reinforcement learning (RL) for battery scheduling, reduces operational regret by 76--93\% compared to robust decision making (RDM). In 25-year investment backtests, it enables up to five of ten high-emitting industrial sectors per region to cross the commercial viability threshold of 12\% Internal Rate of Return (IRR). These results show that high-resolution, long-horizon solar forecasts can directly translate into measurable economic gains, supporting near-optimal energy operations and accelerating renewable deployment.</description>

      <title>Directly Aligning the Full Diffusion Trajectory with Fine-Grained Human Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However, they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive, thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.</description>

      <title>Interleaving Reasoning for Better Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL), which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .</description>

      <title>Deep Reactive Policy: Learning Reactive Manipulator Motion Planning for Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization, outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both simulated and real-world settings.

      <title>H$_{2}$OT: Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Video Pose Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module (TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

      <description>arXiv:2301.07737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks trained with gradient descent can undergo non-trivial phase transitions as a function of the learning rate. In \cite{lewkowycz2020large} it was discovered that wide neural nets can exhibit a catapult phase for super-critical learning rates, where the training loss grows exponentially quickly at early times before rapidly decreasing to a small value. During this phase the top eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) also undergoes significant evolution. In this work, we will prove that the catapult phase exists in a large class of models, including quadratic models and two-layer, homogenous neural nets. To do this, we show that for a certain range of learning rates the weight norm decreases whenever the loss becomes large. We also empirically study learning rates beyond this theoretically derived range and show that the activation map of ReLU nets trained with super-critical learning rates becomes increasingly sparse as we increase the learning rate.</description>

      <title>The Curious Price of Distributional Robustness in Reinforcement Learning with a Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates model robustness in reinforcement learning (RL) to reduce the sim-to-real gap in practice. We adopt the framework of distributionally robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs), aimed at learning a policy that optimizes the worst-case performance when the deployed environment falls within a prescribed uncertainty set around the nominal MDP. Despite recent efforts, the sample complexity of RMDPs remained mostly unsettled regardless of the uncertainty set in use. It was unclear if distributional robustness bears any statistical consequences when benchmarked against standard RL. Assuming access to a generative model that draws samples based on the nominal MDP, we provide a near-optimal characterization of the sample complexity of RMDPs when the uncertainty set is specified via either the total variation (TV) distance or chi-squared divergence. The algorithm studied here is a model-based method called distributionally robust value iteration, which is shown to be near-optimal for the full range of uncertainty levels. Somewhat surprisingly, our results uncover that RMDPs are not necessarily easier or harder to learn than standard MDPs. The statistical consequence incurred by the robustness requirement depends heavily on the size and shape of the uncertainty set: in the case w.r.t.~the TV distance, the minimax sample complexity of RMDPs is always smaller than that of standard MDPs; in the case w.r.t.~the chi-squared divergence, the sample complexity of RMDPs far exceeds the standard MDP counterpart.</description>

Abstract: For over two decades, detecting rare events has been a challenging task among researchers in the data mining and machine learning domain. Real-life problems inspire researchers to navigate and further improve data processing and algorithmic approaches to achieve effective and computationally efficient methods for imbalanced learning. In this paper, we have collected and reviewed 258 peer-reviewed papers from archival journals and conference papers in an attempt to provide an in-depth review of various approaches in imbalanced learning from technical and application perspectives. This work aims to provide a structured review of methods used to address the problem of imbalanced data in various domains and create a general guideline for researchers in academia or industry who want to dive into the broad field of machine learning using large-scale imbalanced data.</description>

Abstract: We propose probabilistic Shapley inference (PSI), a novel probabilistic framework to model and infer sufficient statistics of feature attributions in flexible predictive models, via latent random variables whose mean recovers Shapley values. PSI enables efficient, scalable inference over input-to-output attributions, and their uncertainty, via a variational objective that jointly trains a predictive (regression or classification) model and its attribution distributions. To address the challenge of marginalizing over variable-length input feature subsets in Shapley value calculation, we introduce a masking-based neural network architecture, with a modular training and inference procedure. We evaluate PSI on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that it achieves competitive predictive performance compared to strong baselines, while learning feature attribution distributions -- centered at Shapley values -- that reveal meaningful attribution uncertainty across data modalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein sequence design has seen significant advances through discrete diffusion and autoregressive approaches, yet the potential of continuous diffusion remains underexplored. Here, we present DiMA, a latent diffusion framework that operates on protein language model representations. Through systematic exploration of architectural choices and diffusion components, we develop a robust methodology that generalizes across multiple protein encoders ranging from 8M to 3B parameters. We demonstrate that our framework achieves consistently high performance across sequence-only (ESM-2, ESMc), dual-decodable (CHEAP), and multimodal (SaProt) representations using the same architecture and training approach. We extensively evaluate existing methods alongside DiMA using multiple metrics across two protein modalities, covering quality, diversity, novelty, and distribution matching of generated proteins. DiMA consistently produces novel, high-quality and diverse protein sequences and achieves strong results compared to baselines such as autoregressive, discrete diffusion and flow matching language models. The model demonstrates versatile functionality, supporting conditional generation tasks including protein family-generation, motif scaffolding and infilling, and fold-specific sequence design. This work provides a universal continuous diffusion framework for protein sequence generation, offering both architectural insights and practical applicability across various protein design scenarios.

      <title>DACAD: Domain Adaptation Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In time series anomaly detection (TSAD), the scarcity of labeled data poses a challenge to the development of accurate models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</description>

      <title>The Over-Certainty Phenomenon in Modern Test-Time Adaptation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When neural networks are confronted with unfamiliar data that deviate from their training set, this signifies a domain shift. While these networks output predictions on their inputs, they typically fail to account for their level of familiarity with these novel observations. Prevailing works navigate test-time adaptation with the goal of curtailing model entropy, yet they unintentionally produce models that struggle with sub-optimal calibration-a dilemma we term the over-certainty phenomenon. This over-certainty in predictions can be particularly dangerous in the setting of domain shifts, as it may lead to misplaced trust. In this paper, we propose a solution that not only maintains accuracy but also addresses calibration by mitigating the over-certainty phenomenon. To do this, we introduce a certainty regularizer that dynamically adjusts pseudo-label confidence by accounting for both backbone entropy and logit norm. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of Expected Calibration Error and Negative Log Likelihood, all while maintaining parity in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Towards a General Time Series Forecasting Model with Unified Representation and Adaptive Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing availability of multi-domain time series data, there is an increasing demand for general forecasting models pre-trained on multi-source datasets to support diverse downstream prediction scenarios. Existing time series foundation models primarily focus on scaling up pre-training datasets and model sizes to enhance generalization performance. In this paper, we take a different approach by addressing two critical aspects of general forecasting models: (1) how to derive unified representations from heterogeneous multi-domain time series data, and (2) how to effectively capture domain-specific features to enable adaptive transfer across various downstream scenarios. To address the first aspect, we propose Decomposed Frequency Learning as the pre-training task, which leverages frequency-based masking and reconstruction to decompose coupled semantic information in time series, resulting in unified representations across domains. For the second aspect, we introduce the Time Series Register, which captures domain-specific representations during pre-training and enhances adaptive transferability to downstream tasks. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance on seven real-world benchmarks, demonstrating remarkable few-shot and zero-shot capabilities.</description>

      <title>MedualTime: A Dual-Adapter Language Model for Medical Time Series-Text Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06620v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent rapid advancements in language models (LMs) have garnered attention in medical time series-text multimodal learning. However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</description>

      <title>ALPS: Improved Optimization for Highly Sparse One-Shot Pruning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impressive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various natural language processing tasks comes at the cost of vast computational resources and storage requirements. One-shot pruning techniques offer a way to alleviate these burdens by removing redundant weights without the need for retraining. Yet, the massive scale of LLMs often forces current pruning approaches to rely on heuristics instead of optimization-based techniques, potentially resulting in suboptimal compression. In this paper, we introduce ALPS, an optimization-based framework that tackles the pruning problem using the operator splitting technique and a preconditioned conjugate gradient-based post-processing step. Our approach incorporates novel techniques to accelerate and theoretically guarantee convergence while leveraging vectorization and GPU parallelism for efficiency. ALPS substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the pruning objective and perplexity reduction, particularly for highly sparse models. On the OPT-30B model with 70% sparsity, ALPS achieves a 13% reduction in test perplexity on the WikiText dataset and a 19% improvement in zero-shot benchmark performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Neural CRNs: A Natural Implementation of Learning in Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00034v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular circuits capable of autonomous learning could unlock novel applications in fields such as bioengineering and synthetic biology. To this end, existing chemical implementations of neural computing have mainly relied on emulating discrete-layered neural architectures using steady-state computations of mass action kinetics. In contrast, we propose an alternative dynamical systems-based approach in which neural computations are modeled as the time evolution of molecular concentrations. The analog nature of our framework naturally aligns with chemical kinetics-based computation, leading to more compact circuits. We present the advantages of our framework through three key demonstrations. First, we assemble an end-to-end supervised learning pipeline using only two sequential phases, the minimum required number for supervised learning. Then, we show (through appropriate simplifications) that both linear and nonlinear modeling circuits can be implemented solely using unimolecular and bimolecular reactions, avoiding the complexities of higher-order chemistries. Finally, we demonstrate that first-order gradient approximations can be natively incorporated into the framework, enabling nonlinear models to scale linearly rather than combinatorially with input dimensionality. All the circuit constructions are validated through training and inference simulations across various regression and classification tasks. Our work presents a viable pathway toward embedding learning behaviors in synthetic biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>MENSA: A Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis with Trajectory-based Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing time-to-event methods focus on either single-event or competing-risk settings, leaving multi-event scenarios relatively underexplored. In many real-world applications, the same patient may experience multiple events that are non-exclusive, and sometimes semi-competing. A common workaround is to train separate single-event models, but this approach fails to exploit dependencies and shared structure across events. To address these limitations, we propose MENSA (Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis), a deep learning model that jointly models flexible time-to-event distributions for multiple events, whether competing or co-occurring. In addition, we introduce a novel trajectory-based likelihood that captures the temporal ordering between events. Across five benchmark datasets, MENSA consistently improves prediction performance over many state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is available at https://github.com/thecml/mensa.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in state-space model architectures have shown great promise for efficient sequence modeling, but challenges remain in balancing computational efficiency with model expressiveness. We propose the Flash STU architecture, a hybrid model that interleaves spectral state space model layers with sliding window attention, enabling scalability to billions of parameters for language modeling while maintaining a near-linear time complexity. We evaluate the Flash STU and its variants on diverse sequence prediction tasks, including linear dynamical systems, robotics control, and language modeling. We find that, given a fixed parameter budget, the Flash STU architecture consistently outperforms the Transformer and other leading state-space models such as S4 and Mamba-2.</description>

      <title>Rethinking GNN Expressive Power from a Distributed Computational Model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of graph neural networks (GNNs) has motivated theoretical studies on their expressive power, often through alignments with the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests. However, such analyses typically focus on the ability of GNNs to distinguish between graph structures, rather than to compute or approximate specific function classes. The latter is more commonly studied in machine learning theory, including results such as the Turing completeness of recurrent networks and the universal approximation property of feedforward networks. We argue that using well-defined computational models, such as a modified CONGEST model with clearly specified preprocessing and postprocessing, offers a more sound framework for analyzing GNN expressiveness. Within this framework, we show that allowing unrestricted preprocessing or incorporating externally computed features, while claiming that these precomputations enhance the expressiveness, can sometimes lead to problems. We also show that the lower bound on a GNN's capacity (depth multiplied by width) to simulate one iteration of the WL test actually grows nearly linearly with graph size, indicating that the WL test is not locally computable and is misaligned with message-passing GNNs. Despite these negative results, we also present positive results that characterize the effects of virtual nodes and edges from a computational model perspective. Finally, we highlight several open problems regarding GNN expressiveness for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Energy-based Policies using Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy-based policies offer a flexible framework for modeling complex, multimodal behaviors in reinforcement learning (RL). In maximum entropy RL, the optimal policy is a Boltzmann distribution derived from the soft Q-function, but direct sampling from this distribution in continuous action spaces is computationally intractable. As a result, existing methods typically use simpler parametric distributions, like Gaussians, for policy representation -- limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of multimodal action distributions. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based approach for sampling from energy-based policies, where the negative Q-function defines the energy function. Based on this approach, we propose an actor-critic method called Diffusion Q-Sampling (DQS) that enables more expressive policy representations, allowing stable learning in diverse environments. We show that our approach enhances sample efficiency in continuous control tasks and captures multimodal behaviors, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

      <title>An Architecture Built for Federated Learning: Addressing Data Heterogeneity through Adaptive Normalization-Free Feature Recalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized collaborative training paradigm preserving stakeholders' data ownership while improving performance and generalization. However, statistical heterogeneity among client datasets degrades system performance. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Normalization-free Feature Recalibration (ANFR), a model architecture-level approach that combines weight standardization and channel attention to combat heterogeneous data in FL. ANFR leverages weight standardization to avoid mismatched client statistics and inconsistent averaging, ensuring robustness under heterogeneity, and channel attention to produce learnable scaling factors for feature maps, suppressing inconsistencies across clients due to heterogeneity. We demonstrate that combining these techniques boosts model performance beyond their individual contributions, by improving class selectivity and channel attention weight distribution. ANFR works with any aggregation method, supports both global and personalized FL, and adds minimal overhead. Furthermore, when training with differential privacy, ANFR achieves an appealing balance between privacy and utility, enabling strong privacy guarantees without sacrificing performance. By integrating weight standardization and channel attention in the backbone model, ANFR offers a novel and versatile approach to the challenge of statistical heterogeneity. Extensive experiments show ANFR consistently outperforms established baselines across various aggregation methods, datasets, and heterogeneity conditions. Code is provided at https://github.com/siomvas/ANFR.</description>

      <title>Learning Load Balancing with GNN in MPTCP-Enabled Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are a promising paradigm of heterogeneous network (HetNet), attributed to the complementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency. However, the current development of such HetNets is mostly bottlenecked by the existing transmission control protocol (TCP), which restricts the user equipment (UE) to connecting one access point (AP) at a time. While the ongoing investigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, it complicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing (LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets, which results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a graph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded as node features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared to the conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based model exhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network topology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a single trained model. Simulation results show that against the traditional optimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal throughput within a gap of 11.5%, while reducing the inference time by 4 orders of magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, the new method can improve the network throughput by up to 21.7%, at a similar inference time level.</description>

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations assess unfairness by revealing how inputs must change to achieve a desired outcome. This paper introduces the first graph-based framework for generating group counterfactual explanations to audit group fairness, a key aspect of trustworthy machine learning. Our framework, FACEGroup (Feasible and Actionable Counterfactual Explanations for Group Fairness), models real-world feasibility constraints, identifies subgroups with similar counterfactuals, and captures key trade-offs in counterfactual generation, distinguishing it from existing methods. To evaluate fairness, we introduce novel metrics for both group and subgroup level analysis that explicitly account for these trade-offs. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FACEGroup effectively generates feasible group counterfactuals while accounting for trade-offs, and that our metrics capture and quantify fairness disparities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grounding the instruction in the environment is a key step in solving language-guided goal-reaching reinforcement learning problems. In automated reinforcement learning, a key concern is to enhance the model's ability to generalize across various tasks and environments. In goal-reaching scenarios, the agent must comprehend the different parts of the instructions within the environmental context in order to complete the overall task successfully. In this work, we propose CAREL (Cross-modal Auxiliary REinforcement Learning) as a new framework to solve this problem using auxiliary loss functions inspired by video-text retrieval literature and a novel method called instruction tracking, which automatically keeps track of progress in an environment. The results of our experiments suggest superior sample efficiency and systematic generalization for this framework in multi-modal reinforcement learning problems. Our code base is available here.</description>

      <title>Off-Policy Maximum Entropy RL with Future State and Action Visitation Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum entropy reinforcement learning integrates exploration into policy learning by providing additional intrinsic rewards proportional to the entropy of some distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in which the intrinsic reward function is the relative entropy of the discounted distribution of states and actions (or features derived from these states and actions) visited during future time steps. This approach is motivated by three results. First, this new objective is a lower bound on the negated entropy of the marginal visitation distribution of states and actions, commonly used as an alternative exploration objective. Second, a policy maximizing the expected discounted sum of intrinsic rewards also maximizes a lower bound on the state-action value function of the decision process. Third, the distribution used in the intrinsic reward definition is the fixed point of a contraction operator. Existing algorithms can therefore be adapted to learn this fixed point off-policy and compute the intrinsic rewards. We finally introduce an algorithm maximizing our new objective and show that resulting policies have good state-action space coverage and achieve high-performance control.</description>

      <title>Neural Port-Hamiltonian Differential Algebraic Equations for Compositional Learning of Electrical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop compositional learning algorithms for coupled dynamical systems, with a particular focus on electrical networks. While deep learning has proven effective at modeling complex relationships from data, compositional couplings between system components typically introduce algebraic constraints on state variables, posing challenges to many existing data-driven approaches to modeling dynamical systems. Towards developing deep learning models for constrained dynamical systems, we introduce neural port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations (N-PHDAEs), which use neural networks to parameterize unknown terms in both the differential and algebraic components of a port-Hamiltonian DAE. To train these models, we propose an algorithm that uses automatic differentiation to perform index reduction, automatically transforming the neural DAE into an equivalent system of neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), for which established model inference and backpropagation methods exist. Experiments simulating the dynamics of nonlinear circuits exemplify the benefits of our approach: the proposed N-PHDAE model achieves an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy and constraint satisfaction when compared to a baseline N-ODE over long prediction time horizons. We also validate the compositional capabilities of our approach through experiments on a simulated DC microgrid: we train individual N-PHDAE models for separate grid components, before coupling them to accurately predict the behavior of larger-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Achieving $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ Regret in Average-Reward POMDPs with Known Observation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle average-reward infinite-horizon POMDPs with an unknown transition model but a known observation model, a setting that has been previously addressed in two limiting ways: (i) frequentist methods relying on suboptimal stochastic policies having a minimum probability of choosing each action, and (ii) Bayesian approaches employing the optimal policy class but requiring strong assumptions about the consistency of employed estimators. Our work removes these limitations by proving convenient estimation guarantees for the transition model and introducing an optimistic algorithm that leverages the optimal class of deterministic belief-based policies. We introduce modifications to existing estimation techniques providing theoretical guarantees separately for each estimated action transition matrix. Unlike existing estimation methods that are unable to use samples from different policies, we present a novel and simple estimator that overcomes this barrier. This new data-efficient technique, combined with the proposed \emph{Action-wise OAS-UCRL} algorithm and a tighter theoretical analysis, leads to the first approach enjoying a regret guarantee of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \,\log T})$ when compared against the optimal policy, thus improving over state of the art techniques. Finally, theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations showing the efficacy of our method against baseline methods.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Justification for Asymmetric Actor-Critic Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning for partially observable environments, many successful algorithms have been developed within the asymmetric learning paradigm. This paradigm leverages additional state information available at training time for faster learning. Although the proposed learning objectives are usually theoretically sound, these methods still lack a precise theoretical justification for their potential benefits. We propose such a justification for asymmetric actor-critic algorithms with linear function approximators by adapting a finite-time convergence analysis to this setting. The resulting finite-time bound reveals that the asymmetric critic eliminates error terms arising from aliasing in the agent state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex systems, information propagation can be defined as diffused or delocalized, weakly localized, and strongly localized. This study investigates the application of graph neural network models to learn the behavior of a linear dynamical system on networks. A graph convolution and attention-based neural network framework has been developed to identify the steady-state behavior of the linear dynamical system. We reveal that our trained model distinguishes the different states with high accuracy. Furthermore, we have evaluated model performance with real-world data. In addition, to understand the explainability of our model, we provide an analytical derivation for the forward and backward propagation of our framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Kolmogorov-Arnold based interpretable networks (KAN) have strong theoretical expressiveness, they face significant parameter explosion and high-frequency feature capture challenges in high-dimensional tasks. To address this issue, we propose the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Fourier Network (KAF), which effectively integrates trainable Random Fourier Features (RFF) and a novel hybrid GELU-Fourier activation mechanism to balance parameter efficiency and spectral representation capabilities. Our key technical contributions include: (1) merging KAN's dual-matrix structure through matrix association properties to substantially reduce parameters; (2) introducing learnable RFF initialization strategies to eliminate spectral distortion in high-dimensional approximation tasks; (3) implementing an adaptive hybrid activation function that progressively enhances frequency representation during the training process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our KAF across various domains including vision, NLP, audio processing, and differential equation-solving tasks, effectively combining theoretical interpretability with practical utility and computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has revolutionized data-driven modeling by enabling the synthesis of high-dimensional data across various applications, including image generation, language modeling, biomedical signal processing, and anomaly detection. Flow-based generative models provide a powerful framework for capturing complex probability distributions, offering exact likelihood estimation, efficient sampling, and deterministic transformations between distributions. These models leverage invertible mappings governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), enabling precise density estimation and likelihood evaluation. This tutorial presents an intuitive mathematical framework for flow-based generative models, formulating them as neural network-based representations of continuous probability densities. We explore key theoretical principles, including the Wasserstein metric, gradient flows, and density evolution governed by ODEs, to establish convergence guarantees and bridge empirical advancements with theoretical insights. By providing a rigorous yet accessible treatment, we aim to equip researchers and practitioners with the necessary tools to effectively apply flow-based generative models in signal processing and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the Primacy Effect in Structured State-Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13729v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structured state-space models (SSMs) have been developed to offer more persistent memory retention than traditional recurrent neural networks, while maintaining real-time inference capabilities and addressing the time-complexity limitations of Transformers. Despite this intended persistence, the memory mechanism of canonical SSMs is theoretically designed to decay monotonically over time, meaning that more recent inputs are expected to be retained more accurately than earlier ones. Contrary to this theoretical expectation, however, the present study reveals a counterintuitive finding: when trained and evaluated on a synthetic, statistically balanced memorization task, SSMs predominantly preserve the *initially* presented data in memory. This pattern of memory bias, known as the *primacy effect* in psychology, presents a non-trivial challenge to the current theoretical understanding of SSMs and opens new avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of rank aggregation methods for the partial label ranking problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17077v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The label ranking problem is a supervised learning scenario in which the learner predicts a total order of the class labels for a given input instance. Recently, research has increasingly focused on the partial label ranking problem, a generalization of the label ranking problem that allows ties in the predicted orders. So far, most existing learning approaches for the partial label ranking problem rely on approximation algorithms for rank aggregation in the final prediction step. This paper explores several alternative aggregation methods for this critical step, including scoring-based and non-parametric probabilistic-based rank aggregation approaches. To enhance their suitability for the more general partial label ranking problem, the investigated methods are extended to increase the likelihood of producing ties. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that scoring-based variants consistently outperform the current state-of-the-art method in handling incomplete information. In contrast, non-parametric probabilistic-based variants fail to achieve competitive performance.</description>

      <title>VIPER: Visual Perception and Explainable Reasoning for Sequential Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning on text and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are highly effective for visual perception, applying those models for visual instruction-based planning remains a widely open problem. In this paper, we introduce VIPER, a novel framework for multimodal instruction-based planning that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-based reasoning. Our approach uses a modular pipeline where a frozen VLM generates textual descriptions of image observations, which are then processed by an LLM policy to predict actions based on the task goal. We fine-tune the reasoning module using behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning, improving our agent's decision-making capabilities. Experiments on the ALFWorld benchmark show that VIPER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visual instruction-based planners while narrowing the gap with purely text-based oracles. By leveraging text as an intermediate representation, VIPER also enhances explainability, paving the way for a fine-grained analysis of perception and reasoning components.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Detection on a Budget: Efficient Bayesian Estimation of Semantic Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting whether an LLM hallucinates is an important research challenge. One promising way of doing so is to estimate the semantic entropy (Farquhar et al., 2024) of the distribution of generated sequences. We propose a new algorithm for doing that, with two main advantages. First, due to us taking the Bayesian approach, we achieve a much better quality of semantic entropy estimates for a given budget of samples from the LLM. Second, we are able to tune the number of samples adaptively so that `harder' contexts receive more samples. We demonstrate empirically that our approach systematically beats the baselines, requiring only 53% of samples used by Farquhar et al. (2024) to achieve the same quality of hallucination detection as measured by AUROC. Moreover, quite counterintuitively, our estimator is useful even with just one sample from the LLM.</description>

      <title>M1: Towards Scalable Test-Time Compute with Mamba Reasoning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective reasoning is crucial to solving complex mathematical problems. Recent large language models (LLMs) have boosted performance by scaling test-time computation through long chain-of-thought reasoning. However, transformer-based models are inherently limited in extending context length due to their quadratic computational complexity and linear memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid linear RNN reasoning model, M1, built on the Mamba architecture, which allows memory-efficient inference. Our approach leverages a distillation process from existing reasoning models and is further enhanced through RL training. Experimental results on the AIME and MATH benchmarks show that M1 not only outperforms previous linear RNN models but also matches the performance of state-of-the-art Deepseek R1 distilled reasoning models at a similar scale. We also compare our generation speed with a highly performant general purpose inference engine, vLLM, and observe more than a 3x speedup compared to a same size transformer. With throughput speedup, we are able to achieve higher accuracy compared to DeepSeek R1 distilled transformer reasoning models under a fixed generation time budget using self-consistency voting. Overall, we introduce a hybrid Mamba reasoning model and provide a more effective approach to scaling test-time generation using self-consistency or long chain of thought reasoning.</description>

      <title>An All-Atom Generative Model for Designing Protein Complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or biomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on single-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with advancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold2. Despite these developments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely uncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions. Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom Protein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. We released our code at https://github.com/bytedance/apm.</description>

      <title>In-context Ranking Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) allow large language models (LLMs) to function as implicit ranking models by maximizing the margin between preferred and non-preferred responses. In practice, user feedback on such lists typically involves identifying a few relevant items in context rather than providing detailed pairwise comparisons for every possible item pair. Moreover, many complex information retrieval tasks, such as conversational agents and summarization systems, critically depend on ranking the highest-quality outputs at the top, emphasizing the need to support natural and flexible forms of user feedback. To address the challenge of limited and sparse pairwise feedback in the in-context setting, we propose an In-context Ranking Preference Optimization (IRPO) framework that directly optimizes LLMs based on ranking lists constructed during inference. To further capture flexible forms of feedback, IRPO extends the DPO objective by incorporating both the relevance of items and their positions in the list. Modeling these aspects jointly is non-trivial, as ranking metrics are inherently discrete and non-differentiable, making direct optimization difficult. To overcome this, IRPO introduces a differentiable objective based on positional aggregation of pairwise item preferences, enabling effective gradient-based optimization of discrete ranking metrics. We further provide theoretical insights showing that IRPO (i) automatically emphasizes items with greater disagreement between the model and the reference ranking, and (ii) links its gradient to an importance sampling estimator, yielding an unbiased estimator with reduced variance. Empirical results show IRPO outperforms standard DPO approaches in ranking performance, highlighting its effectiveness in aligning LLMs with direct in-context ranking preferences.</description>

      <title>Addressing Concept Mislabeling in Concept Bottleneck Models Through Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18026v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) propose to enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems by constraining their decisions on a set of human-understandable concepts. However, CBMs typically assume that datasets contain accurate concept labels-an assumption often violated in practice, which we show can significantly degrade performance (by 25% in some cases). To address this, we introduce the Concept Preference Optimization (CPO) objective, a new loss function based on Direct Preference Optimization, which effectively mitigates the negative impact of concept mislabeling on CBM performance. We provide an analysis of key properties of the CPO objective, showing it directly optimizes for the concept's posterior distribution, and contrast it against Binary Cross Entropy (BCE), demonstrating that CPO is inherently less sensitive to concept noise. We empirically confirm our analysis by finding that CPO consistently outperforms BCE on three real-world datasets, both with and without added label noise. We make our code available on Github.</description>

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have emerged as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering linear-time complexity and competitive performance across diverse tasks. However, their large parameter counts pose significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose a novel unstructured pruning framework tailored for Mamba models that achieves up to 70\% parameter reduction while retaining over 95\% of the original performance. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a gradient-aware magnitude pruning technique that combines weight magnitude and gradient information to identify less critical parameters, (2) an iterative pruning schedule that gradually increases sparsity to maintain model stability, and (3) a global pruning strategy that optimizes parameter allocation across the entire model. Through extensive experiments on WikiText-103, Long Range Arena, and ETT time-series benchmarks, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains with minimal performance degradation. Our analysis of pruning effects on Mamba's components reveals critical insights into the architecture's redundancy and robustness, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained settings while broadening Mamba's applicability.</description>

      <title>Identification and Optimal Nonlinear Control of Turbojet Engine Using Koopman Eigenfunction Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gas turbine engines are complex and highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging because it requires performance characteristics that are not always available, often leading to many simplifying assumptions. This paper discusses the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models, and addresses these issues by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics are estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics is mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. This process involves eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model is validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator are then designed within the eigenfunction space and compared to traditional and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure enables targeting individual modes during optimization, leading to improved performance tuning. Results demonstrate that the Koopman-based controller surpasses other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.</description>

      <title>A Minimum Description Length Approach to Regularization in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art neural networks can be trained to become remarkable solutions to many problems. But while these architectures can express symbolic, perfect solutions, trained models often arrive at approximations instead. We show that the choice of regularization method plays a crucial role: when trained on formal languages with standard regularization ($L_1$, $L_2$, or none), expressive architectures not only fail to converge to correct solutions but are actively pushed away from perfect initializations. In contrast, applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to balance model complexity with data fit provides a theoretically grounded regularization method. Using MDL, perfect solutions are selected over approximations, independently of the optimization algorithm. We propose that unlike existing regularization techniques, MDL introduces the appropriate inductive bias to effectively counteract overfitting and promote generalization.</description>

      <title>MetaSTH-Sleep: Towards Effective Few-Shot Sleep Stage Classification for Health Management with Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Enhanced Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages based on bio-signals is fundamental not only for automatic sleep stage annotation, but also for clinical health management and continuous sleep monitoring. Traditionally, this task relies on experienced clinicians to manually annotate data, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown promise in automating this task. However, three major challenges remain: (1) deep learning models typically require large-scale labeled datasets, making them less effective in real-world settings where annotated data is limited; (2) significant inter-individual variability in bio-signals often results in inconsistent model performance when applied to new subjects, limiting generalization; and (3) existing approaches often overlook the high-order relationships among bio-signals, failing to simultaneously capture signal heterogeneity and spatial-temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose MetaSTH-Sleep, a few-shot sleep stage classification framework based on spatial-temporal hypergraph enhanced meta-learning. Our approach enables rapid adaptation to new subjects using only a few labeled samples, while the hypergraph structure effectively models complex spatial interconnections and temporal dynamics simultaneously in EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaSTH-Sleep achieves substantial performance improvements across diverse subjects, offering valuable insights to support clinicians in sleep stage annotation.</description>

      <title>Steering LLM Reasoning Through Bias-Only Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that training a single $d$-dimensional steering vector per layer with reinforcement learning, while freezing all base weights, matches the accuracy of fully RL-tuned reasoning models on mathematical-reasoning tasks. On an 8 billion-parameter model this adds only $\approx 0.0016\%$ additional parameters and reproduces performance across a range of base models and mathematical-reasoning benchmarks. These results tighten the upper bound on the parameter budget required for high-level chain-of-thought reasoning, indicating that millions of adapter weights are unnecessary. The minimal trainable footprint reduces optimizer memory and inter-GPU communication, lowering the overall cost of fine-tuning. Moreover, a logit-lens analysis shows that the learned vectors amplify coherent token directions, providing clearer insight into the model's internal computations.</description>

      <title>Grower-in-the-Loop Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Greenhouse Climate Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions. Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However, interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs, achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast, reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect inputs.</description>

      <title>Who Gets Credit or Blame? Attributing Accountability in Modern AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern AI systems are typically developed through multiple stages-pretraining, fine-tuning rounds, and subsequent adaptation or alignment, where each stage builds on the previous ones and updates the model in distinct ways. This raises a critical question of accountability: when a deployed model succeeds or fails, which stage is responsible, and to what extent? We pose the accountability attribution problem for tracing model behavior back to specific stages of the model development process. To address this challenge, we propose a general framework that answers counterfactual questions about stage effects: how would the model's behavior have changed if the updates from a particular stage had not occurred? Within this framework, we introduce estimators that efficiently quantify stage effects without retraining the model, accounting for both the data and key aspects of model optimization dynamics, including learning rate schedules, momentum, and weight decay. We demonstrate that our approach successfully quantifies the accountability of each stage to the model's behavior. Based on the attribution results, our method can identify and remove spurious correlations learned during image classification and text toxicity detection tasks that were developed across multiple stages. Our approach provides a practical tool for model analysis and represents a significant step toward more accountable AI development.</description>

      <title>ThinkEval: Practical Evaluation of Knowledge Leakage in LLM Editing using Thought-based Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust model-editing techniques are essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in practical applications, to enable cost-effective ways to deal with challenges such as privacy breaches, bias mitigation and misinformation spread. For example, an LLM-based healthcare assistance may need to update out-dated or incorrect knowledge to prevent harmful recommendations. However, many editing techniques focus on isolated facts, which critically fail to prevent indirect knowledge leakage -- the unintended reconstruction of edited-out information through persistent causal links and contextual relationships. To assist users in selecting the right editing technique, we develop and present ThinkEval, a framework to systematically quantify indirect knowledge leakage and ripple effects in model-editing. ThinkEval builds and employs specialized knowledge graphs to analyze the causal structure of facts before and after editing. To support this approach, we present KnowGIC, a benchmark dataset comprising multi-step reasoning paths that precisely measure these complex knowledge transformation effects. We evaluate five editing techniques: AlphaEdit, RECT, ROME, MEMIT, and PRUNE across multiple LLMs. Our results show that these techniques struggle to balance indirect fact suppression with the preservation of related knowledge, compromising the contextual integrity of a model's knowledge. Our dataset is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowGIC.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</description>

      <title>Pruning Spurious Subgraphs for Graph Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05957v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge, with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, PrunE retains the invariant subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization. Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges: 1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2) $\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly.

      <description>arXiv:2506.07040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of $Q$-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under contamination, total-variation (TV) distance, and Wasserstein uncertainty sets. A key ingredient of our analysis is showing that the optimal robust $Q$ operator is a strict contraction with respect to a carefully designed semi-norm (with constant functions quotiented out). This property enables a stochastic approximation update that learns the optimal robust $Q$-function using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. We also provide an efficient routine for robust $Q$-function estimation, which in turn facilitates robust critic estimation. Building on this, we introduce an actor-critic algorithm that learns an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy within $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. We provide numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws of Motion Forecasting and Planning - Technical Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics. Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows, optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.</description>

      <title>A Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer for Human Activity Intensity Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human activity intensity prediction is crucial to many location-based services. Despite tremendous progress in modeling dynamics of human activity, most existing methods overlook physical constraints of spatial interaction, leading to uninterpretable spatial correlations and over-smoothing phenomenon. To address these limitations, this work proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by integrating the universal law of gravitation to refine transformer attention. Specifically, it (1) estimates two spatially explicit mass parameters based on spatiotemporal embedding feature, (2) models the spatial interaction in end-to-end neural network using proposed adaptive gravity model to learn the physical constraint, and (3) utilizes the learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon in transformer attention. Moreover, a parallel spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer is proposed for achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative superiority of our model over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be not only disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws, but also improved the generalization in zero-shot cross-region inference. This work provides a novel insight into integrating physical laws with deep learning for spatiotemporal prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its long history, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and variational training remain underused in practice: standard Gaussian posteriors misalign with network geometry, KL terms can be brittle in high dimensions, and implementations often add complexity without reliably improving uncertainty. We revisit the problem through the lens of normalization. Because normalization layers neutralize the influence of weight magnitude, we model uncertainty \emph{only in weight directions} using a von Mises-Fisher posterior on the unit sphere. High-dimensional geometry then yields a single, interpretable scalar per layer--the effective post-normalization noise $\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}$--that (i) corresponds to simple additive Gaussian noise in the forward pass and (ii) admits a compact, dimension-aware KL in closed form. We derive accurate, closed-form approximations linking concentration $\kappa$ to activation variance and to $\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}$ across regimes, producing a lightweight, implementation-ready variational unit that fits modern normalized architectures and improves calibration without sacrificing accuracy. This dimension awareness is critical for stable optimization in high dimensions. In short, by aligning the variational posterior with the network's intrinsic geometry, BNNs can be simultaneously principled, practical, and precise.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine learning tasks, for instance, high-dimensional data representations commonly required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%, making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI), a statistical framework for both causal and predictive inference using unstructured data, including text and images. GPI leverages open-source Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models -- such as large language models and diffusion models -- not only to generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional representations that are guaranteed to capture their underlying structure. Applying machine learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2) estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.</description>

      <title>PLAME: Lightweight MSA Design Advances Protein Folding From Evolutionary Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein structure prediction often hinges on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which underperform on low-homology and orphan proteins. We introduce PLAME, a lightweight MSA design framework that leverages evolutionary embeddings from pretrained protein language models to generate MSAs that better support downstream folding. PLAME couples these embeddings with a conservation-diversity loss that balances agreement on conserved positions with coverage of plausible sequence variation. Beyond generation, we develop (i) an MSA selection strategy to filter high-quality candidates and (ii) a sequence-quality metric that is complementary to depth-based measures and predictive of folding gains. On AlphaFold2 low-homology/orphan benchmarks, PLAME delivers state-of-the-art improvements in structure accuracy (e.g., lDDT/TM-score), with consistent gains when paired with AlphaFold3. Ablations isolate the benefits of the selection strategy, and case studies elucidate how MSA characteristics shape AlphaFold confidence and error modes. Finally, we show PLAME functions as a lightweight adapter, enabling ESMFold to approach AlphaFold2-level accuracy while retaining ESMFold-like inference speed. PLAME thus provides a practical path to high-quality folding for proteins lacking strong evolutionary neighbors.</description>

      <title>Supervised Fine Tuning on Curated Data is Reinforcement Learning (and can be improved)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data. The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks. For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.</description>

      <title>Your Attention Matters: to Improve Model Robustness to Noise and Spurious Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-attention mechanisms are foundational to Transformer architectures, supporting their impressive success in a wide range of tasks. While there are many self-attention variants, their robustness to noise and spurious correlations has not been well studied. This study evaluates Softmax, Sigmoid, Linear, Doubly Stochastic, and Cosine attention within Vision Transformers under different data corruption scenarios. Through testing across the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenette datasets, we show that Doubly Stochastic attention is the most robust. It consistently outperformed the next best mechanism by $0.1\%-5.1\%$ when training data, or both training and testing data, were corrupted. Our findings inform self-attention selection in contexts with imperfect data. The code used is available at https://github.com/ctamayor/NeurIPS-Robustness-ViT.</description>

      <title>Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement for Noisy Label Domain Adaptation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant representations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property prediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely on the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world scenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e., semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other, enabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to the noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware regularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains of up to 12.7% in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Driven Reliability: Selective Prediction and Trustworthy Deployment in Modern Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains where reliability is paramount. This thesis investigates how uncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML, focusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is low.
  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty signals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By ensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight, post-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep ensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance. Crucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP), allowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find that while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains robust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty trade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective classification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve -- identifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions can close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking errors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show that uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or deny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining calibration audits with verifiable inference.
  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating, and safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make accurate predictions -- but also know when to say "I do not know".</description>

      <title>BadPromptFL: A Novel Backdoor Threat to Prompt-based Federated Learning in Multimodal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(&gt;90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Confounding is a Pervasive Problem in Real World Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine, ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging Generalization and Personalization in Human Activity Recognition via On-Device Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with different sensing modalities requires both strong generalization across diverse users and efficient personalization for individuals. However, conventional HAR models often fail to generalize when faced with user-specific variations, leading to degraded performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel on-device few-shot learning framework that bridges generalization and personalization in HAR. Our method first trains a generalizable representation across users and then rapidly adapts to new users with only a few labeled samples, updating lightweight classifier layers directly on resource-constrained devices. This approach achieves robust on-device learning with minimal computation and memory cost, making it practical for real-world deployment. We implement our framework on the energy-efficient RISC-V GAP9 microcontroller and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets (RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, Ultrasound-Gesture). Across these scenarios, post-deployment adaptation improves accuracy by 3.73\%, 17.38\%, and 3.70\%, respectively. These results demonstrate that few-shot on-device learning enables scalable, user-aware, and energy-efficient wearable human activity recognition by seamlessly uniting generalization and personalization. The related framework is open sourced for further research\footnote{https://github.com/kangpx/onlineTiny2023}.</description>

      <title>Amortized In-Context Mixed Effect Transformer Models: A Zero-Shot Approach for Pharmacokinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants, generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Generalization of Anti-Regularization for Parametric Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anti-regularization introduces a reward term with a reversed sign into the loss function, deliberately amplifying model expressivity in small-sample regimes while ensuring that the intervention gradually vanishes as the sample size grows through a power-law decay schedule. We formalize spectral safety conditions and trust-region constraints, and we design a lightweight safeguard that combines a projection operator with gradient clipping to guarantee stable intervention. Theoretical analysis extends to linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel regime, providing practical guidance on the choice of decay exponents through the balance between empirical risk and variance. Empirical results show that Anti-regularization mitigates underfitting in both regression and classification while preserving generalization and improving calibration. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and safeguards are essential to avoiding overfitting and instability. As an alternative, we also propose a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that maintains constant per-sample complexity. Anti-regularization constitutes a simple and reproducible procedure that integrates seamlessly into standard empirical risk minimization pipelines, enabling robust learning under limited data and resource constraints by intervening only when necessary and vanishing otherwise.</description>

      <title>Towards Synthesizing Normative Data for Cognitive Assessments Using Generative Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming, and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs, guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional limitations.</description>

      <title>Group Expectation Policy Optimization for Heterogeneous Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction. Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>Complementary Learning System Empowers Online Continual Learning of Vehicle Motion Forecasting in Smart Cities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence underpins most smart city services, yet deep neural network (DNN) that forecasts vehicle motion still struggle with catastrophic forgetting, the loss of earlier knowledge when models are updated. Conventional fixes enlarge the training set or replay past data, but these strategies incur high data collection costs, sample inefficiently and fail to balance long- and short-term experience, leaving them short of human-like continual learning. Here we introduce Dual-LS, a task-free, online continual learning paradigm for DNN-based motion forecasting that is inspired by the complementary learning system of the human brain. Dual-LS pairs two synergistic memory rehearsal replay mechanisms to accelerate experience retrieval while dynamically coordinating long-term and short-term knowledge representations. Tests on naturalistic data spanning three countries, over 772,000 vehicles and cumulative testing mileage of 11,187 km show that Dual-LS mitigates catastrophic forgetting by up to 74.31\% and reduces computational resource demand by up to 94.02\%, markedly boosting predictive stability in vehicle motion forecasting without inflating data requirements. Meanwhile, it endows DNN-based vehicle motion forecasting with computation efficient and human-like continual learning adaptability fit for smart cities.</description>

      <title>Failure Prediction Is a Better Performance Proxy for Early-Exit Networks Than Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early-exit models accelerate inference by attaching internal classifiers to intermediate layers of the network, allowing computation to halt once a prediction meets a predefined exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on confidence-based exit strategies, which has motivated prior work to calibrate intermediate classifiers in pursuit of improved performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this paper, we argue that calibration metrics can be misleading indicators of multi-exit model performance. Specifically, we present empirical evidence showing that miscalibrated networks can outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose using failure prediction as a more informative proxy for early-exit model performance. Unlike calibration, failure prediction captures changes in sample rankings and correlates strongly with efficiency gains, offering a more reliable framework for designing and evaluating early-exit models.</description>

      <title>Missing Data Imputation using Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and post-imputation performance.</description>

      <title>Any-Order Flexible Length Masked Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations. To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference. Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve $\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance ($52\% \to 65\%$).</description>

      <title>Optimizing In-Context Learning for Efficient Full Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP (SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP (FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning (ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP (E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.</description>

      <title>Online Identification of IT Systems through Active Causal Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online, data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions. Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with system operations.</description>

      <title>AdaGrad Meets Muon: Adaptive Stepsizes for Orthogonal Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient. Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10 classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon and Adam.</description>

      <title>Insights from Gradient Dynamics: Gradient Autoscaled Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification, stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide insights for future optimization research.</description>

      <title>CPEP: Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training Enhances Gesture Generalization on EMG Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables. In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.</description>

      <title>ModalSurv: A Multimodal Deep Survival Framework for Prostrate and Bladder Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient management. In this work, we present ModaliSurv, a multimodal deep survival model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks. For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting, our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving heterogeneous biomedical data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.03346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for learning time-varying graphs from spatiotemporal measurements. Given an appropriate prior on the temporal behavior of signals, our proposed method can estimate time-varying graphs from a small number of available measurements. To achieve this, we introduce two regularization terms in convex optimization problems that constrain sparseness of temporal variations of the time-varying networks. Moreover, a computationally-scalable algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve the optimization problem. The experimental results with synthetic and real datasets (point cloud and temperature data) demonstrate our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Modeling Visual Hallucination: A Generative Adversarial Network Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.08209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual hallucination refers to the perception of recognizable things that are not present. These phenomena are commonly linked to a range of neurological/psychiatric disorders. Despite ongoing research, the mechanisms through which the visual system generates hallucinations from real-world environments are still not well understood. Abnormal interactions between different regions of the brain responsible for perception are known to contribute to the occurrence of visual hallucinations. In this study, we propose and extend a generative neural network-based framework to address challenges within the visual system, aiming to create goal-driven models inspired by neurobiological mechanisms of visual hallucinations. We focus on the adversarial interactions between the visual system and the frontal lobe regions, proposing the Hallu-GAN model to suggest how these interactions can give rise to visual hallucinations. The architecture of the Hallu-GAN model is based on generative adversarial networks. Our simulation results indicate that disturbances in the ventral stream can lead to visual hallucinations. To further analyze the impact of other brain regions on the visual system, we extend the Hallu-GAN model by adding EEG data from individuals. This extended model, referred to as Hallu-GAN+, enables the examination of both hallucinating and non-hallucinating states. By training the Hallu-GAN+ model with EEG data from an individual with Charles Bonnet syndrome, we demonstrated its utility in analyzing the behavior of those experiencing hallucinations. Our simulation results confirmed the capability of the proposed model in resembling the visual system in both healthy and hallucinating states.</description>

      <title>Data-Adaptive Graph Framelets with Generalized Vanishing Moments for Graph Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general framework for constructing tight framelet systems on graphs with localized supports based on partition trees. Our construction of framelets provides a simple and efficient way to obtain the orthogonality with $k$ arbitrary orthonormal vectors. When the $k$ vectors contain most of the energy of a family of graph signals, the orthogonality of the framelets intuitively possesses ``generalized ($k$-)vanishing'' moments, and thus, the coefficients are sparse. Moreover, our construction provides not only framelets that are overall sparse vectors but also fast and schematically concise transforms. In a data-adaptive setting, the graph framelet systems can be learned by conducting optimizations on Stiefel manifolds to provide the utmost sparsity for a given family of graph signals. Furthermore, we further exploit the generality of our proposed graph framelet systems for heterophilous graph learning, where graphs are characterized by connecting nodes mainly from different classes. The usual assumption that connected nodes are similar and belong to the same class for homophilious graphs is contradictory for heterophilous graphs. Thus, we are motivated to bypass simple assumptions on heterophilous graphs and focus on generating rich node features induced by the graph structure, so as to improve the graph learning ability of certain neural networks in node classification. We derive a specific system of graph framelets and propose a heuristic method to select framelets as features for neural network input. Several experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach for non-linear approximation, denoising, and node classification.</description>

      <title>Multiple Noises in Diffusion Model for Semi-Supervised Multi-Domain Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of multi-domain translation, where the objective is to learn mappings between arbitrary configurations of domains within a defined set (such as $(D_1, D_2)\rightarrow{}D_3$, $D_2\rightarrow{}(D_1, D_3)$, $D_3\rightarrow{}D_1$, etc. for three domains) without the need for separate models for each specific translation configuration, enabling more efficient and flexible domain translation. We introduce Multi-Domain Diffusion (MDD), a method with dual purposes: i) reconstructing any missing views for new data objects, and ii) enabling learning in semi-supervised contexts with arbitrary supervision configurations. MDD achieves these objectives by exploiting the noise formulation of diffusion models, specifically modeling one noise level per domain. Similar to existing domain translation approaches, MDD learns the translation between any combination of domains. However, unlike prior work, our formulation inherently handles semi-supervised learning without modification by representing missing views as noise in the diffusion process. We evaluate our approach through domain translation experiments on BL3NDT, a multi-domain synthetic dataset designed for challenging semantic domain inversion, the BraTS2020 dataset, and the CelebAMask-HQ dataset.</description>

      <title>The GOOSE Dataset for Perception in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential for deploying autonomous systems can be significantly increased by improving the perception and interpretation of the environment. However, the development of deep learning-based techniques for autonomous systems in unstructured outdoor environments poses challenges due to limited data availability for training and testing. To address this gap, we present the German Outdoor and Offroad Dataset (GOOSE), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for unstructured outdoor environments. The GOOSE dataset incorporates 10 000 labeled pairs of images and point clouds, which are utilized to train a range of state-of-the-art segmentation models on both image and point cloud data. We open source the dataset, along with an ontology for unstructured terrain, as well as dataset standards and guidelines. This initiative aims to establish a common framework, enabling the seamless inclusion of existing datasets and a fast way to enhance the perception capabilities of various robots operating in unstructured environments. The dataset, pre-trained models for offroad perception, and additional documentation can be found at https://goose-dataset.de/.</description>

      <title>Differentiable DG with Neural Operator Source Term Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18897v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational advances have fundamentally transformed the landscape of numerical simulations, enabling unprecedented levels of complexity and precision in modeling physical phenomena. While these high-fidelity simulations offer invaluable insights for scientific discovery and problem solving, they impose substantial computational requirements. Consequently, low-fidelity models augmented with subgrid-scale parameterizations are employed to achieve computational feasibility. We introduce an end-to-end differentiable framework for solving the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. This integrated approach combines a differentiable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver with a neural network source term. Through the implementation of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) for network parameter optimization, our methodology ensures continuous interaction with the governing equations throughout the training process. We refer to this approach as NODE-DG. This hybrid approach combines the accuracy of numerical methods with the efficiency of machine learning, offering the following key advantages: (1) improved accuracy of low-order DG approximations by capturing subgrid-scale dynamics; (2) robustness against nonuniform or missing temporal data; (3) elimination of operator-splitting errors; (3) total mass conservation; and (4) a continuous-in-time operator that enables variable time step predictions, which accelerate projected high-order DG simulations. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework through two examples: two-dimensional Kelvin--Helmholtz instability and three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex examples.</description>

      <title>On Rate-Optimal Partitioning Classification from Observable and from Privatised Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the classical method of partitioning classification and study its convergence rate under relaxed conditions, both for observable (non-privatised) and for privatised data. We consider the problem of classification in a $d$ dimensional Euclidean space. Previous results on the partitioning classifier worked with the strong density assumption, which is restrictive, as we demonstrate through simple examples. Here, we study the problem under much milder assumptions. We presuppose that the distribution of the inputs is a mixture of an absolutely continuous and a discrete distribution, such that the absolutely continuous component is concentrated to a $d_a$ dimensional subspace. In addition to the standard Lipschitz and margin conditions, a novel characteristic of the absolutely continuous component is introduced, by which the exact convergence rate of the classification error probability is computed, both for the binary and for the multi-label cases. Interestingly, this rate of convergence depends only on the intrinsic dimension of the inputs, $d_a$. The privacy constraints mean that the independent identically distributed data cannot be directly observed, and the classifiers are functions of the randomised outcome of a suitable local differential privacy mechanism. In this paper we add Laplace distributed noises to the discontinuations of all possible locations of the feature vector and to its label. Again, tight upper bounds on the rate of convergence of the classification error probability are derived, without the strong density assumption, such that this rate depends on $2d_a$.</description>

      <title>Systematic Assessment of Tabular Data Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data synthesis has been advocated as an important approach for utilizing data while protecting data privacy. In recent years, a plethora of tabular data synthesis algorithms (i.e., synthesizers) have been proposed. Some synthesizers satisfy Differential Privacy, while others aim to provide privacy in a heuristic fashion. A comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these synthesizers remains elusive due to drawbacks in evaluation metrics and missing head-to-head comparisons of newly developed synthesizers that take advantage of diffusion models and large language models with state-of-the-art statistical synthesizers. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation framework for assessing tabular data synthesis algorithms. Specifically, we examine and critique existing evaluation metrics, and introduce a set of new metrics in terms of fidelity, privacy, and utility to address their limitations. We conducted extensive evaluations of 8 different types of synthesizers on 12 real-world datasets and identified some interesting findings, which offer new directions for privacy-preserving data synthesis.</description>

      <title>AnyGPT: Unified Multimodal LLM with Discrete Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12226v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce AnyGPT, an any-to-any multimodal language model that utilizes discrete representations for the unified processing of various modalities, including speech, text, images, and music. AnyGPT can be trained stably without any alterations to the current large language model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of new languages. We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language model. Demos are shown in https://junzhan2000.github.io/AnyGPT.github.io/</description>

      <title>Toward a Team of AI-made Scientists for Scientific Discovery from Gene Expression Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for scientific discovery, enabling researchers to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. For instance, it has facilitated the identification of disease-predictive genes from gene expression data, significantly advancing healthcare. However, the traditional process for analyzing such datasets demands substantial human effort and expertise for the data selection, processing, and analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework, a Team of AI-made Scientists (TAIS), designed to streamline the scientific discovery pipeline. TAIS comprises simulated roles, including a project manager, data engineer, and domain expert, each represented by a Large Language Model (LLM). These roles collaborate to replicate the tasks typically performed by data scientists, with a specific focus on identifying disease-predictive genes. Furthermore, we have curated a benchmark dataset to assess TAIS's effectiveness in gene identification, demonstrating our system's potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and scope of scientific exploration. Our findings represent a solid step towards automating scientific discovery through large language models.</description>

      <title>Repetition Improves Language Model Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bidirectional models are considered essential for strong text embeddings. Recent approaches to adapt autoregressive language models (LMs) into strong text embedding models have largely had the requirement to modify the LM architecture to be bidirectional. We challenge this premise by introducing "echo embeddings" which converts autoregressive LMs into high quality text embedding models without changing the architecture or requiring fine-tuning. By repeating the input and extracting embeddings from the repeated tokens -- which have access to all original tokens -- echo embeddings improve over classical LM embeddings by over 5% in zero-shot settings. Our zero-shot embeddings nearly match those obtained by bidirectionally-converted LMs that undergo additional masked-language modeling training. Echo embeddings are also compatible with supervised fine-tuning, matching or outperforming bidirectionally-converted LMs in an apples-to-apples comparison, even with an identical compute budget during training and inference. Overall, repetition is a simple and effective strategy to circumvent the need for bidirectional attention in embedding models, paving the way towards a unified architecture for all NLP tasks.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Uncertainty Quantification: an Analysis of Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13748v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an intractable distribution $p$, the problem of variational inference (VI) is to find the best approximation from some more tractable family $Q$. Commonly, one chooses $Q$ to be a family of factorized distributions (i.e., the mean-field assumption), even though $p$ itself does not factorize. We show that this mismatch leads to an impossibility theorem: if $p$ does not factorize, then any factorized approximation $q\!\in\!Q$ can correctly estimate at most one of the following three measures of uncertainty: (i) the marginal variances, (ii) the marginal precisions, or (iii) the generalized variance (which for elliptical distributions is closely related to the entropy). In practice, the best variational approximation in $Q$ is found by minimizing some divergence $D(q,p)$ between distributions, and so we ask: how does the choice of divergence determine which measure of uncertainty, if any, is correctly estimated by VI? We consider the classic Kullback-Leibler divergences, the more general $\alpha$-divergences, and a score-based divergence which compares $\nabla \log p$ and $\nabla \log q$. We thoroughly analyze the case where $p$ is a Gaussian and $q$ is a (factorized) Gaussian. In this setting, we show that all the considered divergences can be ordered based on the estimates of uncertainty they yield as objective functions for VI. Finally, we empirically evaluate the validity of this ordering when the target distribution $p$ is not Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Data Augmentation for Cardiac MRI using Text-Conditioned Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While deep learning holds great promise for disease diagnosis and prognosis in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, its progress is often constrained by highly imbalanced and biased training datasets. To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and health condition. We adopt ControlNet based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to condition on text assembled from patient metadata and cardiac geometry derived from segmentation masks. We assess our method using a large-cohort study from the UK Biobank by evaluating the realism of the generated images using established quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a downstream classification task aimed at debiasing a classifier by rectifying imbalances within underrepresented groups through synthetically generated samples. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating dataset imbalances, such as the scarcity of diagnosed female patients or individuals with normal BMI level suffering from heart failure. This work represents a major step towards the adoption of synthetic data for the development of fair and generalizable models for medical classification tasks. Notably, we conduct all our experiments using a single, consumer-level GPU to highlight the feasibility of our approach within resource-constrained environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/faildeny/debiasing-cardiac-mri.</description>

      <title>Molecular Generative Adversarial Network with Multi-Property Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), have been employed for $de~novo$ molecular generation in drug discovery. Most prior studies have utilized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, particularly Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), to handle the discrete nature of molecular representations in GANs. However, due to the inherent instability in training GANs and RL models, along with the high computational cost associated with MCTS sampling, MCTS RL-based GANs struggle to scale to large chemical databases. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces a novel GAN based on actor-critic RL with instant and global rewards, called InstGAN, to generate molecules at the token-level with multi-property optimization. Furthermore, maximized information entropy is leveraged to alleviate the mode collapse. The experimental results demonstrate that InstGAN outperforms other baselines, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, and efficiently generates molecules with multi-property optimization. The source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Robust Generative Learning with Lipschitz-Regularized $\alpha$-Divergences Allows Minimal Assumptions on Target Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the robustness of Lipschitz-regularized $\alpha$-divergences as objective functionals in generative modeling, showing they enable stable learning across a wide range of target distributions with minimal assumptions. We establish that these divergences remain finite under a mild condition-that the source distribution has a finite first moment-regardless of the properties of the target distribution, making them adaptable to the structure of target distributions. Furthermore, we prove the existence and finiteness of their variational derivatives, which are essential for stable training of generative models such as GANs and gradient flows. For heavy-tailed targets, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions that connect data dimension, $\alpha$, and tail behavior to divergence finiteness, that also provide insights into the selection of suitable $\alpha$'s. We also provide the first sample complexity bounds for empirical estimations of these divergences on unbounded domains. As a byproduct, we obtain the first sample complexity bounds for empirical estimations of these divergences and the Wasserstein-1 metric with group symmetry on unbounded domains. Numerical experiments confirm that generative models leveraging Lipschitz-regularized $\alpha$-divergences can stably learn distributions in various challenging scenarios, including those with heavy tails or complex, low-dimensional, or fractal support, all without any prior knowledge of the structure of target distributions.</description>

      <title>Online Prompt Pricing based on Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit and Hierarchical Stackelberg Game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generation models have shown promising performance in various tasks, making trading around machine learning models possible. In this paper, we aim at a novel prompt trading scenario, prompt bundle trading (PBT) system, and propose an online pricing mechanism. Based on the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) and three-stage hierarchical Stackelburg (HS) game, our pricing mechanism considers the profits of the consumer, platform, and seller, simultaneously achieving the profit satisfaction of these three participants. We break down the pricing issue into two steps, namely unknown category selection and incentive strategy optimization. The former step is to select a set of categories with the highest qualities, and the latter is to derive the optimal strategy for each participant based on the chosen categories. Unlike the existing fixed pricing mode, the PBT pricing mechanism we propose is more flexible and diverse, which is more in accord with the transaction needs of real-world scenarios. We test our method on a simulated text-to-image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, which provides a feasible price-setting standard for the prompt marketplaces.</description>

Abstract: Objectives: To present a publicly available deep learning-based torso segmentation model that provides comprehensive voxel-wise coverage, including delineations that extend to the boundaries of anatomical compartments. Materials and Methods: We extracted preliminary segmentations from TotalSegmentator, spine, and body composition models for Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MR) images, then improved them iteratively and retrained an nnUNet model. Using a random retrospective subset of German National Cohort (NAKO), UK Biobank, internal MR and Computed Tomography (CT) data (Training: 2897 series from 626 subjects, 290 female; mean age 53+-16; 3-fold-cross validation (20% hold-out). Internal testing 36 series from 12 subjects, 6 male; mean age 60+-11), we segmented 71 structures in torso MR and 72 in CT images: 20 organs, 10 muscles, 19 vessels, 16 bones, ribs in CT, intervertebral discs, spinal cord, spinal canal and body composition (subcutaneous fat, unclassified muscles and visceral fat). For external validation, we used existing automatic organ segmentations, independent ground truth segmentations on gradient echo images, and the Amos data. We used non-parametric bootstrapping for confidence intervals and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for computing statistical significance. Results: We achieved an average Dice score of 0.90+-0.06 on our internal gradient echo test set, which included 71 semantic segmentation labels. Our model ties with the best model on Amos with a Dice of 0,81+-0.14, while having a larger field of view and a considerably higher number structures included. Conclusion: Our work presents a publicly available full-torso segmentation model for MRI and CT images that classifies almost all subject voxels to date.</description>

      <title>Effect of Random Learning Rate: Theoretical Analysis of SGD Dynamics in Non-Convex Optimization via Stationary Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a random learning rate and reveal its convergence properties. SGD is a widely used stochastic optimization algorithm in machine learning, especially deep learning. Numerous studies reveal the convergence properties of SGD and its theoretically favorable variants. Among these, the analysis of convergence using a stationary distribution of updated parameters provides generalizable results. However, to obtain a stationary distribution, the update direction of the parameters must not degenerate, which limits the applicable variants of SGD. In this study, we consider a novel SGD variant, Poisson SGD, which has degenerated parameter update directions and instead utilizes a random learning rate. Consequently, we demonstrate that a distribution of a parameter updated by Poisson SGD converges to a stationary distribution under weak assumptions on a loss function. Based on this, we further show that Poisson SGD finds global minima in non-convex optimization problems and also evaluate the generalization error using this method. As a proof technique, we approximate the distribution by Poisson SGD with that of the bouncy particle sampler (BPS) and derive its stationary distribution, using the theoretical advance of the piece-wise deterministic Markov process (PDMP).</description>

      <title>A Fully Parameter-Free Second-Order Algorithm for Convex-Concave Minimax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study second-order algorithms for the convex-concave minimax problem, which has attracted much attention in many fields such as machine learning in recent years. We propose a Lipschitz-free cubic regularization (LF-CR) algorithm for solving the convex-concave minimax optimization problem without knowing the Lipschitz constant. It can be shown that the iteration complexity of the LF-CR algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal solution with respect to the restricted primal-dual gap is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\rho^{2/3}\|z_0-z^*\|^2\epsilon^{-2/3})$ , where $z_0=(x_0,y_0)$ is a pair of initial points, $z^*=(x^*,y^*)$ is a pair of optimal solutions, and $\rho$ is the Lipschitz constant. We further propose a fully parameter-free cubic regularization (FF-CR) algorithm that does not require any parameters of the problem, including the Lipschitz constant and the upper bound of the distance from the initial point to the optimal solution. We also prove that the iteration complexity of the FF-CR algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal solution with respect to the gradient norm is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\rho^{2/3}\|z_0-z^*\|^{4/3}\epsilon^{-2/3}) $. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of both algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FF-CR algorithm is a completely parameter-free second-order algorithm, and its iteration complexity is currently the best in terms of $\epsilon$ under the termination criterion of the gradient norm.</description>

      <title>Autoencoders in Function Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoencoders have found widespread application in both their original deterministic form and in their variational formulation (VAEs). In scientific applications and in image processing it is often of interest to consider data that are viewed as functions; while discretisation (of differential equations arising in the sciences) or pixellation (of images) renders problems finite dimensional in practice, conceiving first of algorithms that operate on functions, and only then discretising or pixellating, leads to better algorithms that smoothly operate between resolutions. In this paper function-space versions of the autoencoder (FAE) and variational autoencoder (FVAE) are introduced, analysed, and deployed. Well-definedness of the objective governing VAEs is a subtle issue, particularly in function space, limiting applicability. For the FVAE objective to be well defined requires compatibility of the data distribution with the chosen generative model; this can be achieved, for example, when the data arise from a stochastic differential equation, but is generally restrictive. The FAE objective, on the other hand, is well defined in many situations where FVAE fails to be. Pairing the FVAE and FAE objectives with neural operator architectures that can be evaluated on any mesh enables new applications of autoencoders to inpainting, superresolution, and generative modelling of scientific data.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Accurate Pneumonia Detection Using a Novel Multi-Scale Transformer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04290v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pneumonia, a prevalent respiratory infection, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among vulnerable populations. Chest X-rays serve as a primary tool for pneumonia detection; however, variations in imaging conditions and subtle visual indicators complicate consistent interpretation. Automated tools can enhance traditional methods by improving diagnostic reliability and supporting clinical decision-making. In this study, we propose a novel multi-scale transformer approach for pneumonia detection that integrates lung segmentation and classification into a unified framework. Our method introduces a lightweight transformer-enhanced TransUNet for precise lung segmentation, achieving a Dice score of 95.68% on the "Chest X-ray Masks and Labels" dataset with fewer parameters than traditional transformers. For classification, we employ pre-trained ResNet models (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101) to extract multi-scale feature maps, which are then processed through a modified transformer module to enhance pneumonia detection. This integration of multi-scale feature extraction and lightweight transformer modules ensures robust performance, making our method suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Our approach achieves 93.75% accuracy on the "Kermany" dataset and 96.04% accuracy on the "Cohen" dataset, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency. This work demonstrates the potential of multi-scale transformer architectures to improve pneumonia diagnosis, offering a scalable and accurate solution to global healthcare challenges. https://github.com/amirrezafateh/Multi-Scale-Transformer-Pneumonia</description>

      <title>Confirmation Bias in Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret information in a way that aligns with one's preconceptions, can profoundly impact scientific research, leading to conclusions that reflect the researcher's hypotheses even when the observational data do not support them. This issue is especially critical in scientific fields involving highly noisy observations, such as cryo-electron microscopy.
  This study investigates confirmation bias in Gaussian mixture models. We consider the following experiment: A team of scientists assumes they are analyzing data drawn from a Gaussian mixture model with known signals (hypotheses) as centroids. However, in reality, the observations consist entirely of noise without any informative structure. The researchers use a single iteration of the K-means or expectation-maximization algorithms, two popular algorithms to estimate the centroids. Despite the observations being pure noise, we show that these algorithms yield biased estimates that resemble the initial hypotheses, contradicting the unbiased expectation that averaging these noise observations would converge to zero. Namely, the algorithms generate estimates that mirror the postulated model, although the hypotheses (the presumed centroids of the Gaussian mixture) are not evident in the observations. Specifically, among other results, we prove a positive correlation between the estimates produced by the algorithms and the corresponding hypotheses. We also derive explicit closed-form expressions of the estimates for a finite and infinite number of hypotheses. This study underscores the risks of confirmation bias in low signal-to-noise environments, provides insights into potential pitfalls in scientific methodologies, and highlights the importance of prudent data interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Evidential Transformer, an uncertainty-driven transformer model for improved and robust image retrieval. In this paper, we make several contributions to content-based image retrieval (CBIR). We incorporate probabilistic methods into image retrieval, achieving robust and reliable results, with evidential classification surpassing traditional training based on multiclass classification as a baseline for deep metric learning. Furthermore, we improve the state-of-the-art retrieval results on several datasets by leveraging the Global Context Vision Transformer (GC ViT) architecture. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate the reliability of our approach, setting a new benchmark in CBIR in all test settings on the Stanford Online Products (SOP) and CUB-200-2011 datasets.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Standardizing Similarity Measures in a Rapidly Evolving Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Similarity measures are fundamental tools for quantifying the alignment between artificial and biological systems. However, the diversity of similarity measures and their varied naming and implementation conventions makes it challenging to compare across studies. To facilitate comparisons and make explicit the implementation choices underlying a given code package, we have created and are continuing to develop a Python repository that benchmarks and standardizes similarity measures. The goal of creating a consistent naming convention that uniquely and efficiently specifies a similarity measure is not trivial as, for example, even commonly used methods like Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) have at least 12 different variations, and this number will likely continue to grow as the field evolves. For this reason, we do not advocate for a fixed, definitive naming convention. The landscape of similarity measures and best practices will continue to change and so we see our current repository, which incorporates approximately 100 different similarity measures from 14 packages, as providing a useful tool at this snapshot in time. To accommodate the evolution of the field we present a framework for developing, validating, and refining naming conventions with the goal of uniquely and efficiently specifying similarity measures, ultimately making it easier for the community to make comparisons across studies.</description>

      <title>ILeSiA: Interactive Learning of Robot Situational Awareness from Camera Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from demonstration is a promising approach for teaching robots new skills. However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur. We provide all the code and data required to reproduce our experiments at imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/ilesia.</description>

      <title>AARK: An Open Toolkit for Autonomous Racing Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing demands safe control of vehicles at their physical limits for extended periods of time, providing insights into advanced vehicle safety systems which increasingly rely on intervention provided by vehicle autonomy. Participation in this field carries with it a high barrier to entry. Physical platforms and their associated sensor suites require large capital outlays before any demonstrable progress can be made. Simulators allow researches to develop soft autonomous systems without purchasing a platform. However, currently available simulators lack visual and dynamic fidelity, can still be expensive to buy, lack customisation, and are difficult to use. AARK provides three packages, ACI, ACDG, and ACMPC. These packages enable research into autonomous control systems in the demanding environment of racing to bring more people into the field and improve reproducibility: ACI provides researchers with a computer vision-friendly interface to Assetto Corsa for convenient comparison and evaluation of autonomous control solutions; ACDG enables generation of depth, normal and semantic segmentation data for training computer vision models to use in perception systems; and ACMPC gives newcomers to the field a modular full-stack autonomous control solution, capable of controlling vehicles to build from. AARK aims to unify and democratise research into a field critical to providing safer roads and trusted autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Causal Representation Learning with Generative Artificial Intelligence: Application to Texts as Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how to enhance the validity of causal inference with unstructured high-dimensional treatments like texts, by leveraging the power of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Specifically, we propose to use a deep generative model such as large language models (LLMs) to efficiently generate treatments and use their internal representation for subsequent causal effect estimation. We show that the knowledge of this true internal representation helps disentangle the treatment features of interest, such as specific sentiments and certain topics, from other possibly unknown confounding features. Unlike existing methods, the proposed GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI) methodology eliminates the need to learn causal representation from the data, and hence produces more accurate and efficient estimates. We formally establish the conditions required for the nonparametric identification of the average treatment effect, propose an estimation strategy that avoids the violation of the overlap assumption, and derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator through the application of double machine learning. Finally, using an instrumental variables approach, we extend the proposed GPI methodology to the settings in which the treatment feature is based on human perception. The GPI is also applicable to text reuse where an LLM is used to regenerate existing texts. We conduct simulation and empirical studies, using the generated text data from an open-source LLM, Llama~3, to illustrate the advantages of our estimator over state-of-the-art causal representation learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>NeuroBOLT: Resting-state EEG-to-fMRI Synthesis with Multi-dimensional Feature Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indispensable tool in modern neuroscience, providing a non-invasive window into whole-brain dynamics at millimeter-scale spatial resolution. However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs unseen resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with the potential to generalize across varying conditions and sites, which significantly advances the integration of these two modalities.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Infinite Variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16340v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent is a classic algorithm that has gained great popularity especially in the last decades as the most common approach for training models in machine learning. While the algorithm has been well-studied when stochastic gradients are assumed to have a finite variance, there is significantly less research addressing its theoretical properties in the case of infinite variance gradients. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic behavior of stochastic gradient descent in the context of infinite variance stochastic gradients, assuming that the stochastic gradient is regular varying with index $\alpha\in(1,2)$. The closest result in this context was established in 1969 , in the one-dimensional case and assuming that stochastic gradients belong to a more restrictive class of distributions. We extend it to the multidimensional case, covering a broader class of infinite variance distributions. As we show, the asymptotic distribution of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm can be characterized as the stationary distribution of a suitably defined Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by an appropriate stable L\'evy process. Additionally, we explore the applications of these results in linear regression and logistic regression models.</description>

      <title>Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing for Enhanced Straggler Resilience and Numerical Stability in Distributed CNNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices necessitates efficient management of computational resources, often via distributed environments susceptible to latency from straggler nodes. This paper introduces the Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing (FCDCC) framework to enhance straggler resilience and numerical stability in distributed CNNs. We extend Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) with Circulant and Rotation Matrix Embedding (CRME) which was originally proposed for matrix multiplication to high-dimensional tensor convolution. For the proposed scheme, referred to as the Numerically Stable Coded Tensor Convolution (NSCTC) scheme, we also propose two new coded partitioning schemes: Adaptive-Padding Coded Partitioning (APCP) for the input tensor and Kernel-Channel Coded Partitioning (KCCP) for the filter tensor. These strategies enable linear decomposition of tensor convolutions and encoding them into CDC subtasks, combining model parallelism with coded redundancy for robust and efficient execution. Theoretical analysis identifies an optimal trade-off between communication and storage costs. Empirical results validate the framework's effectiveness in computational efficiency, straggler resilience, and scalability across various CNN architectures.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in mathematical research in recent years. This paper applies ML techniques to the study of quivers -- a type of directed multigraph with significant relevance in algebra, combinatorics, computer science, and mathematical physics. Specifically, we focus on the challenging problem of determining the mutation-acyclicity of a quiver on 4 vertices, a property that is pivotal since mutation-acyclicity is often a necessary condition for theorems involving path algebras and cluster algebras. Although this classification is known for quivers with at most 3 vertices, little is known about quivers on more than 3 vertices. We give a computer-assisted proof of a theorem to prove that mutation-acyclicity is decidable for quivers on 4 vertices with edge weight at most 2. By leveraging neural networks (NNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), we then accurately classify more general 4-vertex quivers as mutation-acyclic or non-mutation-acyclic. Our results demonstrate that ML models can efficiently detect mutation-acyclicity, providing a promising computational approach to this combinatorial problem, from which the trained SVM equation provides a starting point to guide future theoretical development.</description>

      <title>ElectroVizQA: How well do Multi-modal LLMs perform in Electronics Visual Question Answering?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to process multi-modal data, providing enhanced contextual understanding of complex problems. MLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA); however, they often struggle with fundamental engineering problems, and there is a scarcity of specialized datasets for training on topics like digital electronics. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark dataset called ElectroVizQA specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' performance on digital electronic circuit problems commonly found in undergraduate curricula. This dataset, the first of its kind tailored for the VQA task in digital electronics, comprises approximately 626 visual questions, offering a comprehensive overview of digital electronics topics. This paper rigorously assesses the extent to which MLLMs can understand and solve digital electronic circuit questions, providing insights into their capabilities and limitations within this specialized domain. By introducing this benchmark dataset, we aim to motivate further research and development in the application of MLLMs to engineering education, ultimately bridging the performance gap and enhancing the efficacy of these models in technical fields.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning via Homomorphic Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) aims to train a global model for multiple clients while maintaining their data privacy. However, current PPFL protocols exhibit one or more of the following insufficiencies: considerable degradation in accuracy, the requirement for sharing keys, and cooperation during the key generation or decryption processes. As a mitigation, we develop the first protocol that utilizes neural networks to implement PPFL, as well as incorporating an Aggregatable Hybrid Encryption scheme tailored to the needs of PPFL. We name these networks as Homomorphic Adversarial Networks (HANs) which demonstrate that neural networks are capable of performing tasks similar to multi-key homomorphic encryption (MK-HE) while solving the problems of key distribution and collaborative decryption. Our experiments show that HANs are robust against privacy attacks. Compared with non-private federated learning, experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate that HANs exhibit a negligible accuracy loss (at most 1.35%). Compared to traditional MK-HE schemes, HANs increase encryption aggregation speed by 6,075 times while incurring a 29.2 times increase in communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Sequential Controlled Langevin Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An effective approach for sampling from unnormalized densities is based on the idea of gradually transporting samples from an easy prior to the complicated target distribution. Two popular methods are (1) Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), where the transport is performed through successive annealed densities via prescribed Markov chains and resampling steps, and (2) recently developed diffusion-based sampling methods, where a learned dynamical transport is used. Despite the common goal, both approaches have different, often complementary, advantages and drawbacks. The resampling steps in SMC allow focusing on promising regions of the space, often leading to robust performance. While the algorithm enjoys asymptotic guarantees, the lack of flexible, learnable transitions can lead to slow convergence. On the other hand, diffusion-based samplers are learned and can potentially better adapt themselves to the target at hand, yet often suffer from training instabilities. In this work, we present a principled framework for combining SMC with diffusion-based samplers by viewing both methods in continuous time and considering measures on path space. This culminates in the new Sequential Controlled Langevin Diffusion (SCLD) sampling method, which is able to utilize the benefits of both methods and reaches improved performance on multiple benchmark problems, in many cases using only 10% of the training budget of previous diffusion-based samplers.</description>

      <title>Concept Bottleneck Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07992v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Large Language Models (CB-LLMs), a novel framework for building inherently interpretable Large Language Models (LLMs). In contrast to traditional black-box LLMs that rely on limited post-hoc interpretations, CB-LLMs integrate intrinsic interpretability directly into the LLMs -- allowing accurate explanations with scalability and transparency. We build CB-LLMs for two essential NLP tasks: text classification and text generation. In text classification, CB-LLMs is competitive with, and at times outperforms, traditional black-box models while providing explicit and interpretable reasoning. For the more challenging task of text generation, interpretable neurons in CB-LLMs enable precise concept detection, controlled generation, and safer outputs. The embedded interpretability empowers users to transparently identify harmful content, steer model behavior, and unlearn undesired concepts -- significantly enhancing the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLMs, which are critical capabilities notably absent in existing models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trustworthy-ML-Lab/CB-LLMs.</description>

      <title>Ask1: Development and Reinforcement Learning-Based Control of a Custom Quadruped Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the design, development, and experimental validation of a custom-built quadruped robot, Ask1. The Ask1 robot shares similar morphology with the Unitree Go1, but features custom hardware components and a different control architecture. We transfer and extend previous reinforcement learning (RL)-based control methods to the Ask1 robot, demonstrating the applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios. By eliminating the need for Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) and reference trajectories, we introduce a novel reward function to guide the robot's motion style. We demonstrate the generalization capability of the proposed RL algorithm by training it on both the Go1 and Ask1 robots. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of this method, showing that Ask1, like the Go1, is capable of navigating various rugged terrains.</description>

      <title>OmniThink: Expanding Knowledge Boundaries in Machine Writing through Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, novelty, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, unoriginal, and repetitive outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a slow-thinking machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they slowly deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/OmniThink.</description>

      <title>Astrocyte-mediated hierarchical modulation enables learning-to-learn in recurrent spiking networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central feature of biological intelligence is the ability to learn to learn, enabling rapid adaptation to novel tasks and environments. Yet its neural basis remains elusive, particularly regarding intrinsic properties, as conventional models rely on simplified point-neuron approximations that neglect their dynamics. Inspired by astrocyte-mediated neuromodulation, we propose a hierarchically modulated recurrent spiking neural network (HM-RSNN) that models learning-to-learn with regulation of intrinsic neuronal properties at two spatiotemporal scales. Global modulation captures task-dependent gating of plasticity driven by wide-field calcium waves, whereas local adaptation simulates microdomain calcium-mediated fine-tuning of intrinsic properties within task-relevant subspaces. We evaluate HM-RSNN on four cognitive tasks, demonstrating its computational advantages over standard RSNNs and artificial neural networks, and revealing task-dependent adaptations across multiple scales, including intrinsic properties, neuronal specialization, membrane potential dynamics, and network modularity. Converging evidence and biological consistency position HM-RSNN as a biologically grounded framework, providing testable insights into how astrocyte-mediated hierarchical modulation of intrinsic properties shapes multi-scale neural dynamics that support learning-to-learn.</description>

      <title>FAAGC: Feature Augmentation on Adaptive Geodesic Curve Based on the shape space theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have been widely applied across various domains and industries. However, many fields still face challenges due to limited and insufficient data. This paper proposes a Feature Augmentation on Adaptive Geodesic Curve (FAAGC) method in the pre-shape space to increase data. In the pre-shape space, objects with identical shapes lie on a great circle. Thus, we project deep model representations into the pre-shape space and construct a geodesic curve, i.e., an arc of a great circle, for each class. Feature augmentation is then performed by sampling along these geodesic paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAAGC improves classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and generalizes well across various feature types.</description>

      <title>Error-quantified Conformal Inference for Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in time series prediction is challenging due to the temporal dependence and distribution shift on sequential data. Conformal inference provides a pivotal and flexible instrument for assessing the uncertainty of machine learning models through prediction sets. Recently, a series of online conformal inference methods updated thresholds of prediction sets by performing online gradient descent on a sequence of quantile loss functions. A drawback of such methods is that they only use the information of revealed non-conformity scores via miscoverage indicators but ignore error quantification, namely the distance between the non-conformity score and the current threshold. To accurately leverage the dynamic of miscoverage error, we propose \textit{Error-quantified Conformal Inference} (ECI) by smoothing the quantile loss function. ECI introduces a continuous and adaptive feedback scale with the miscoverage error, rather than simple binary feedback in existing methods. We establish a long-term coverage guarantee for ECI under arbitrary dependence and distribution shift. The extensive experimental results show that ECI can achieve valid miscoverage control and output tighter prediction sets than other baselines.</description>

      <title>A Match Made in Heaven? Matching Test Cases and Vulnerabilities With the VUTECO Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software vulnerabilities are commonly detected via static analysis, penetration testing, and fuzzing. They can also be found by running unit tests - so-called vulnerability-witnessing tests - that stimulate the security-sensitive behavior with crafted inputs. Developing such tests is difficult and time-consuming; thus, automated data-driven approaches could help developers intercept vulnerabilities earlier. However, training and validating such approaches require a lot of data, which is currently scarce. This paper introduces VUTECO, a deep learning-based approach for collecting instances of vulnerability-witnessing tests from Java repositories. VUTECO carries out two tasks: (1) the "Finding" task to determine whether a test case is security-related, and (2) the "Matching" task to relate a test case to the exact vulnerability it is witnessing. VUTECO successfully addresses the Finding task, achieving perfect precision and 0.83 F0.5 score on validated test cases in VUL4J and returning 102 out of 145 (70%) correct security-related test cases from 244 open-source Java projects. Despite showing sufficiently good performance for the Matching task - i.e., 0.86 precision and 0.68 F0.5 score - VUTECO failed to retrieve any valid match in the wild. Nevertheless, we observed that in almost all of the matches, the test case was still security-related despite being matched to the wrong vulnerability. In the end, VUTECO can help find vulnerability-witnessing tests, though the matching with the right vulnerability is yet to be solved; the findings obtained lay the stepping stone for future research on the matter.</description>

      <title>CHIRLA: Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a key challenge in computer vision, requiring the matching of individuals across cameras, locations, and time. While most research focuses on short-term scenarios with minimal appearance changes, real-world applications demand robust systems that handle long-term variations caused by clothing and physical changes. We present CHIRLA, Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis, a novel dataset designed for video-based long-term person Re-ID. CHIRLA was recorded over seven months in four connected indoor environments using seven strategically placed cameras, capturing realistic movements with substantial clothing and appearance variability. The dataset includes 22 individuals, more than five hours of video, and about 1M bounding boxes with identity annotations obtained through semi-automatic labeling. We also define benchmark protocols for person tracking and Re-ID, covering diverse and challenging scenarios such as occlusion, reappearance, and multi-camera conditions. By introducing this comprehensive benchmark, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Re-ID algorithms that can reliably perform in challenging, long-term real-world scenarios. The benchmark code is publicly available at: https://github.com/bdager/CHIRLA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish novel and general high-dimensional concentration inequalities and Berry-Esseen bounds for vector-valued martingales induced by Markov chains. We apply these results to analyze the performance of the Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm with linear function approximations, a widely used method for policy evaluation in Reinforcement Learning (RL), obtaining a sharp high-probability consistency guarantee that matches the asymptotic variance up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we establish an $O(T^{-\frac{1}{4}}\log T)$ distributional convergence rate for the Gaussian approximation of the TD estimator, measured in convex distance. Our martingale bounds are of broad applicability, and our analysis of TD learning provides new insights into statistical inference for RL algorithms, bridging gaps between classical stochastic approximation theory and modern RL applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Robustness and Accuracy of Text Watermarking Under Real-World Cross-Lingual Manipulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study to benchmark representative watermarking methods in cross-lingual settings. The current literature mainly focuses on the evaluation of watermarking methods for the English language. However, the literature for evaluating watermarking in cross-lingual settings is scarce. This results in overlooking important adversary scenarios in which a cross-lingual adversary could be in, leading to a gray area of practicality over cross-lingual watermarking. In this paper, we evaluate four watermarking methods in four different and vocabulary rich languages. Our experiments investigate the quality of text under different watermarking procedure and the detectability of watermarks with practical translation attack scenarios. Specifically, we investigate practical scenarios that an adversary with cross-lingual knowledge could take, and evaluate whether current watermarking methods are suitable for such scenarios. Finally, from our findings, we draw key insights about watermarking in cross-lingual settings.</description>

      <title>Synthetic data enables context-aware bioacoustic sound event detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a methodology for training foundation models that enhances their in-context learning capabilities within the domain of bioacoustic signal processing. We use synthetically generated training data, introducing a domain-randomization-based pipeline that constructs diverse acoustic scenes with temporally strong labels. We generate over 8.8 thousand hours of strongly-labeled audio and train a query-by-example, transformer-based model to perform few-shot bioacoustic sound event detection. Our second contribution is a public benchmark of 13 diverse few-shot bioacoustics tasks. Our model outperforms previously published methods, and improves relative to other training-free methods by $64\%$. We demonstrate that this is due to increase in model size and data scale, as well as algorithmic improvements. We make our trained model available via an API, to provide ecologists and ethologists with a training-free tool for bioacoustic sound event detection.</description>

      <title>Robust detection of overlapping bioacoustic sound events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for accurately detecting bioacoustic sound events that is robust to overlapping events, a common issue in domains such as ethology, ecology and conservation. While standard methods employ a frame-based, multi-label approach, we introduce an onset-based detection method which we name Voxaboxen. It takes inspiration from object detection methods in computer vision, but simultaneously takes advantage of recent advances in self-supervised audio encoders. For each time window, Voxaboxen predicts whether it contains the start of a vocalization and how long the vocalization is. It also does the same in reverse, predicting whether each window contains the end of a vocalization, and how long ago it started. The two resulting sets of bounding boxes are then fused using a graph-matching algorithm. We also release a new dataset designed to measure performance on detecting overlapping vocalizations. This consists of recordings of zebra finches annotated with temporally-strong labels and showing frequent overlaps. We test Voxaboxen on seven existing data sets and on our new data set. We compare Voxaboxen to natural baselines and existing sound event detection methods and demonstrate SotA results. Further experiments show that improvements are robust to frequent vocalization overlap.</description>

      <title>Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo Features for Kernel Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods in random feature approximations for kernel-based learning. Compared to the classical Monte Carlo (MC) approach \citep{rahimi2007random}, RQMC improves the deterministic approximation error bound from $O_P(1/\sqrt{M})$ to $O(1/M)$ (up to logarithmic factors), matching the rate achieved by quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods \citep{huangquasi}. Beyond the deterministic error bound guarantee, we further establish additional average error bounds for RQMC features: some requiring weaker assumptions and others significantly reducing the exponent of the logarithmic factor. In the context of kernel ridge regression, we show that RQMC features offer computational advantages over MC features while preserving the same statistical error rate. Empirical results further show that RQMC methods maintain stable performance in both low and moderately high-dimensional settings, unlike QMC methods, which suffer from significant performance degradation as dimension increases.</description>

      <title>StreamMind: Unlocking Full Frame Rate Streaming Video Dialogue through Event-Gated Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of real-world human-AI interaction applications, such as AI assistants, the need for Streaming Video Dialogue is critical. To address this need, we introduce StreamMind, a video LLM framework that achieves ultra-FPS streaming video processing (100 fps on a single A100) and enables proactive, always-on responses in real time, without explicit user intervention.
  To solve the key challenge of the contradiction between linear video streaming speed and quadratic transformer computation cost, we propose a novel perception-cognition interleaving paradigm named ''event-gated LLM invocation'', in contrast to the existing per-time-step LLM invocation. By introducing a Cognition Gate network between the video encoder and the LLM, LLM is only invoked when relevant events occur. To realize the event feature extraction with constant cost, we propose Event-Preserving Feature Extractor (EPFE) based on state-space method, generating a single perception token for spatiotemporal features. These techniques enable the video LLM with full-FPS perception and real-time cognition response.
  Experiments on Ego4D and SoccerNet streaming tasks, as well as standard offline benchmarks, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both model capability and real-time efficiency, paving the way for ultra-high-FPS applications, such as Game AI and interactive media. The code and data is available at https://aka.ms/StreamMind.</description>

      <title>MM-Spatial: Exploring 3D Spatial Understanding in Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at 2D visual understanding but remain limited in their ability to reason about 3D space. In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Latent Fusion of ECG Leads for Early Assessment of Pulmonary Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in early assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) primarily focus on applying machine learning methods to centralized diagnostic modalities, such as 12-lead electrocardiogram (12L-ECG). Despite their potential, these approaches fall short in decentralized clinical settings, e.g., point-of-care and general practice, where handheld 6-lead ECG (6L-ECG) can offer an alternative but is limited by the scarcity of labeled data for developing reliable models. To address this, we propose a lead-specific electrocardiogram multimodal variational autoencoder (\textsc{LS-EMVAE}), which incorporates a hierarchical modality expert (HiME) fusion mechanism and a latent representation alignment loss. HiME combines mixture-of-experts and product-of-experts to enable flexible, adaptive latent fusion, while the alignment loss improves coherence among lead-specific and shared representations. To alleviate data scarcity and enhance representation learning, we adopt a transfer learning strategy: the model is first pre-trained on a large unlabeled 12L-ECG dataset and then fine-tuned on smaller task-specific labeled 6L-ECG datasets. We validate \textsc{LS-EMVAE} across two retrospective cohorts in a 6L-ECG setting: 892 subjects from the ASPIRE registry for (1) PH detection and (2) phenotyping pre-/post-capillary PH, and 16,416 subjects from UK Biobank for (3) predicting elevated pulmonary atrial wedge pressure, where it consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalizability and interpretability. The code is available at https://github.com/Shef-AIRE/LS-EMVAE.</description>

      <title>Beyond SHAP and Anchors: A large-scale experiment on how developers struggle to design meaningful end-user explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning produces models that are impossible for users or developers to fully understand--raising concerns about trust, oversight, safety, and human dignity when they are integrated into software products. Transparency and explainability methods aim to provide some help in understanding models, but it remains challenging for developers to design explanations that are understandable to target users and effective for their purpose. Emerging guidelines and regulations set goals but may not provide effective actionable guidance to developers. In a large-scale experiment with 124 participants, we explored how developers approach providing end-user explanations, including what challenges they face, and to what extent specific policies can guide their actions. We investigated whether and how specific forms of policy guidance help developers design explanations and provide evidence for policy compliance for an ML-powered screening tool for diabetic retinopathy. Participants across the board struggled to produce quality explanations and comply with the provided policies. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the nature and specificity of policy guidance had little effect. We posit that participant noncompliance is in part due to a failure to imagine and anticipate the needs of non-technical stakeholders. Drawing on cognitive process theory and the sociological imagination to contextualize participants' failure, we recommend educational interventions.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Networks Can (Meta-)Learn the Same-Different Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have come to match and exceed human performance in many settings, the tasks these models optimize for are largely constrained to the level of individual objects, such as classification and captioning. Humans remain vastly superior to CNNs in visual tasks involving relations, including the ability to identify two objects as `same' or `different'. A number of studies have shown that while CNNs can be coaxed into learning the same-different relation in some settings, they tend to generalize poorly to other instances of this relation. In this work we show that the same CNN architectures that fail to generalize the same-different relation with conventional training are able to succeed when trained via meta-learning, which explicitly encourages abstraction and generalization across tasks.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Model Predictive Control for Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonlinear data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although DBS is typically implemented in open-loop, closed-loop DBS (CLDBS) uses the amplitude of neural oscillations in specific frequency bands (e.g. beta 13-30 Hz) as a feedback signal, resulting in improved treatment outcomes with reduced side effects and slower rates of patient habituation to stimulation. To date, CLDBS has only been implemented in vivo with simple algorithms such as proportional, proportional-integral, and thresholded switching control. Our approach employs a multi-step predictor based on differences of input-convex neural networks to model the future evolution of beta oscillations. The use of a multi-step predictor enhances prediction accuracy over the optimization horizon and simplifies online computation. In tests using a simulated model of beta-band activity response and data from PD patients, we achieve reductions of more than 20% in both tracking error and control activity in comparison with existing CLDBS algorithms. The proposed control strategy provides a generalizable data-driven technique that can be applied to the treatment of PD and other diseases targeted by CLDBS, as well as to other neuromodulation techniques.</description>

      <title>KD$^{2}$M: A unifying framework for feature knowledge distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) seeks to transfer the knowledge of a teacher, towards a student neural net. This process is often done by matching the networks' predictions (i.e., their output), but, recently several works have proposed to match the distributions of neural nets' activations (i.e., their features), a process known as \emph{distribution matching}. In this paper, we propose an unifying framework, Knowledge Distillation through Distribution Matching (KD$^{2}$M), which formalizes this strategy. Our contributions are threefold. We i) provide an overview of distribution metrics used in distribution matching, ii) benchmark on computer vision datasets, and iii) derive new theoretical results for KD.</description>

      <title>The Ground Cost for Optimal Transport of Angular Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the optimal transport problem over angular velocity dynamics given by the controlled Euler equation. The solution of this problem enables stochastic guidance of spin states of a rigid body (e.g., spacecraft) over a hard deadline constraint by transferring a given initial state statistics to a desired terminal state statistics. This is an instance of generalized optimal transport over a nonlinear dynamical system. While prior work has reported existence-uniqueness and numerical solution of this dynamical optimal transport problem, here we present structural results about the equivalent Kantorovich a.k.a. optimal coupling formulation. Specifically, we focus on deriving the ground cost for the associated Kantorovich optimal coupling formulation. The ground cost is equal to the cost of transporting unit amount of mass from a specific realization of the initial or source joint probability measure to a realization of the terminal or target joint probability measure, and determines the Kantorovich formulation. Finding the ground cost leads to solving a structured deterministic nonlinear optimal control problem, which is shown to be amenable to an analysis technique pioneered by Athans et al. We show that such techniques have broader applicability in determining the ground cost (thus Kantorovich formulation) for a class of generalized optimal mass transport problems involving nonlinear dynamics with translated norm-invariant drift.</description>

      <title>Nemotron-H: A Family of Accurate and Efficient Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03624v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As inference-time scaling becomes critical for enhanced reasoning capabilities, it is increasingly becoming important to build models that are efficient to infer. We introduce Nemotron-H, a family of 8B and 56B/47B hybrid Mamba-Transformer models designed to reduce inference cost for a given accuracy level. To achieve this goal, we replace the majority of self-attention layers in the common Transformer model architecture with Mamba layers that perform constant computation and require constant memory per generated token. We show that Nemotron-H models offer either better or on-par accuracy compared to other similarly-sized state-of-the-art open-sourced Transformer models (e.g., Qwen-2.5-7B/72B and Llama-3.1-8B/70B), while being up to 3$\times$ faster at inference. To further increase inference speed and reduce the memory required at inference time, we created Nemotron-H-47B-Base from the 56B model using a new compression via pruning and distillation technique called MiniPuzzle. Nemotron-H-47B-Base achieves similar accuracy to the 56B model, but is 20% faster to infer. In addition, we introduce an FP8-based training recipe and show that it can achieve on par results with BF16-based training. This recipe is used to train the 56B model. We are releasing Nemotron-H base model checkpoints with support in Hugging Face and NeMo.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation with XL MIMO Systems: OTA Classification via Trainable Analog Combining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining components exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator, similar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the channel coefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer and the receiver's analog combiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the XL MIMO system to the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for Over-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital processing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables near-instantaneous training and efficient classification, even in varying fading conditions, suggesting the paradigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as OTA artificial neural networks alongside their profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and conventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with orders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for inference tasks with ultra low power wireless devices.</description>

      <title>Transforming Hyperspectral Images Into Chemical Maps: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. The U-Net is compared with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error of between 9% and 13% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.53% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Evolutionary Cell Type Matching via Entropy-Minimized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying evolutionary correspondences between cell types across species is a fundamental challenge in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology. Existing approaches often rely on either reference-based matching, which imposes asymmetry by designating one species as the reference, or projection-based matching, which may increase computational complexity and obscure biological interpretability at the cell-type level. Here, we present OT-MESH, an unsupervised computational framework leveraging entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT) to systematically determine cross-species cell type homologies. Our method uniquely integrates the Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn (MESH) technique to refine the OT plan, transforming diffuse transport matrices into sparse, interpretable correspondences. Through systematic evaluation on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that OT-MESH achieves near-optimal matching accuracy with computational efficiency, while maintaining remarkable robustness to noise. Compared to other OT-based methods like RefCM, OT-MESH provides speedup while achieving comparable accuracy. Applied to retinal bipolar cells (BCs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from mouse and macaque, OT-MESH accurately recovers known evolutionary relationships and uncovers novel correspondences, one of which was independently validated experimentally. Thus, our framework offers a principled, scalable, and interpretable solution for evolutionary cell type mapping, facilitating deeper insights into cellular specialization and conservation across species.</description>

      <title>Persona-driven Simulation of Voting Behavior in the European Parliament with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024 European Parliament and our code are available at https://github.com/dess-mannheim/european_parliament_simulation.</description>

      <title>Transit for All: Mapping Equitable Bike2Subway Connection using Region Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1) spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2) comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3) strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in underserved urban communities.</description>

      <title>Pushing Trade-Off Boundaries: Compact yet Effective Remote Sensing Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion, disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Efficient Global Self-Attention (EGSA) to effectively capture semantic information at multiple scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (&lt;1% F1) accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/xulsh8/FlickCD.</description>

      <title>Visual Structures Helps Visual Reasoning: Addressing the Binding Problem in VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the binding problem: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces VISER (Visual Input Structure for Enhanced Reasoning), a simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures and pairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISER improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. VISER enhances binding only with a single-query inference, underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.</description>

      <title>Driver-Net: Multi-Camera Fusion for Assessing Driver Take-Over Readiness in Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block, followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion. As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.</description>

      <title>Robust Bandwidth Estimation for Real-Time Communication with Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate bandwidth estimation (BWE) is critical for real-time communication (RTC) systems. Traditional heuristic approaches offer limited adaptability under dynamic networks, while online reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from high exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which leverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a promising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable deployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust bandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble (an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD risks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment stability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty. Experimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and improves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jiu2021/RBWE_offline.</description>

      <title>Improved sampling algorithms and Poincar\'e inequalities for non-log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\mu$ with density $\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$ with query access to $V$ and $\nabla V$. We start with the following standard assumptions:
  (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth.
  (2) The second moment $\mathbf{E}_{X\sim \mu}[\|X\|^2]\leq M$.
  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling from such distributions is at least $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\'e constant can be arbitrarily large.
  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers (see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23)) strengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following:
  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\mu$ is $L$-smooth.
  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of sampling from $\mu$ can be $\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\cdot \left(\frac{Ld+M}{\epsilon^2}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ when $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the seemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead to an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms.
  Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger moment assumption that $\|X\|$ is $\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\sim\mu$, the Poincar\'e constant of $\mu$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. As an application of our technique, we obtain improved estimate of the Poincar\'e constant for mixture of Gaussians with the same covariance.</description>

      <title>ELK: Exploring the Efficiency of Inter-core Connected AI Chips with Deep Learning Compiler Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To meet the increasing demand of deep learning (DL) models, AI chips are employing both off-chip memory (e.g., HBM) and high-bandwidth low-latency interconnect for direct inter-core data exchange. However, it is not easy to explore the efficiency of these inter-core connected AI (ICCA) chips, due to a fundamental tussle among compute (per-core execution), communication (inter-core data exchange), and I/O (off-chip data access).
  In this paper, we develop Elk, a DL compiler framework to maximize the efficiency of ICCA chips by jointly trading off all the three performance factors discussed above. Elk structures these performance factors into configurable parameters and forms a global trade-off space in the DL compiler. To systematically explore this space and maximize overall efficiency, Elk employs a new inductive operator scheduling policy and a cost-aware on-chip memory allocation algorithm. It generates globally optimized execution plans that best overlap off-chip data loading and on-chip execution. To examine the efficiency of Elk, we build a full-fledged emulator based on a real ICCA chip IPU-POD4, and an ICCA chip simulator for sensitivity analysis with different interconnect network topologies. Elk achieves 94% of the ideal roofline performance of ICCA chips on average, showing the benefits of supporting large DL models on ICCA chips. We also show Elk's capability of enabling architecture design space exploration for new ICCA chip development.</description>

      <title>Not All Features Deserve Attention: Graph-Guided Dependency Learning for Tabular Data Generation with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs' attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality. Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Cascading and Proxy Membership Inference Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional shadow training to boost membership inference performance.
  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.</description>

      <title>COLLAGE: Adaptive Fusion-based Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues. COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g., appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks, where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset.

      <title>Viability of perturbative expansion for quantum field theories on neurons</title>

Abstract: Neural Network (NN) architectures that break statistical independence of parameters have been proposed as a new approach for simulating local quantum field theories (QFTs). In the infinite neuron number limit, single-layer NNs can exactly reproduce QFT results. This paper examines the viability of this architecture for perturbative calculations of local QFTs for finite neuron number $N$ using scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d$ Euclidean dimensions as an example. We find that the renormalized $O(1/N)$ corrections to two- and four-point correlators yield perturbative series which are sensitive to the ultraviolet cut-off and therefore have a weak convergence. We propose a modification to the architecture to improve this convergence and discuss constraints on the parameters of the theory and the scaling of N which allow us to extract accurate field theory results.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Analysis of Unstructured Data with Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the particle physics community needs higher and higher precisions in order to test our current model of the subatomic world, larger and larger datasets are necessary. With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Training-free Alignment of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Efficient Reinforcement Learning Solutions for Last-Mile On-Demand Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation has demonstrated a promising alternative to solving the NP-hard combinatorial problems. Specifically, when it comes to optimization, classical approaches become intractable to account for large-scale solutions. Specifically, we investigate quantum computing to solve the large-scale Capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (CPDPTW). In this regard, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework augmented with a Parametrized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is designed to minimize the travel time in a realistic last-mile on-demand delivery. A novel problem-specific encoding quantum circuit with an entangling and variational layer is proposed. Moreover, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) are designed for comparison through numerical experiments, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the scale of the solution and training complexity while incorporating the real-world constraints.</description>

      <title>Whisper Smarter, not Harder: Adversarial Attack on Partial Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility. We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an effective defence.</description>

      <title>ComplicitSplat: Downstream Models are Vulnerable to Blackbox Attacks by 3D Gaussian Splat Camouflages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Using Artificial Intuition in Distinct, Minimalist Classification of Scientific Abstracts for Management of Technology Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classification of scientific abstracts is useful for strategic activities but challenging to automate because the sparse text provides few contextual clues. Metadata associated with the scientific publication can be used to improve performance but still often requires a semi-supervised setting. Moreover, such schemes may generate labels that lack distinction -- namely, they overlap and thus do not uniquely define the abstract. In contrast, experts label and sort these texts with ease. Here we describe an application of a process we call artificial intuition to replicate the expert's approach, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate metadata. We use publicly available abstracts from the United States National Science Foundation to create a set of labels, and then we test this on a set of abstracts from the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation to examine funding trends. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method for research portfolio management, technology scouting, and other strategic activities.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Landscape of Non-Equilibrium Memories with Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule. Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized. Interactive visualizations of the dynamics studied in this work are available at https://memorynca.github.io/2D.</description>

      <title>Jet-Nemotron: Efficient Language Model with Post Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models, which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3) designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models, such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B total and 2.2B activated parameters.</description>

      <title>PCR-CA: Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment for Multiple-Category App Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps, as traditional taxonomies fail to capture overlapping semantics, leading to suboptimal personalization. We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel -- unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</description>

      <title>Automatic Prompt Optimization with Prompt Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for language models, which is gaining popularity due to the rapid development of prompt engineering driven by extensive research in the field of large language models (LLMs). This paper presents DistillPrompt -- a novel autoprompting method based on large language models that employs a multi-stage integration of task-specific information into prompts using training data. DistillPrompt utilizes distillation, compression, and aggregation operations to explore the prompt space more thoroughly. The method was tested on different datasets for text classification and generation tasks using the t-lite-instruct-0.1 language model. The results demonstrate a significant average improvement (e.g., 20.12% across the entire dataset compared to Grips) in key metrics over existing methods in the field, establishing DistillPrompt as one of the most effective non-gradient approaches in autoprompting.</description>

      <title>ReST-RL: Achieving Accurate Code Reasoning of LLMs with Optimized Self-Training and Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With respect to improving the reasoning accuracy of LLMs, the representative reinforcement learning (RL) method GRPO faces failure due to insignificant reward variance, while verification methods based on process reward models (PRMs) suffer from difficulties with training data acquisition and verification effectiveness. To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a unified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning ability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed test time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of policy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter and assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO sampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After the basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose a test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation required, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by an adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as verification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on coding problems to verify the validity of the proposed RL paradigm. Upon comparison, our approach significantly outperforms other reinforcement training baselines (e.g., naive GRPO and ReST-DPO), as well as decoding and verification baselines (e.g., PRM-BoN and ORM-MCTS) on well-known coding benchmarks of various levels (e.g., APPS, BigCodeBench, and HumanEval), indicating its power to strengthen the reasoning ability of LLM policies. Codes for our project can be found at https://github.com/THUDM/ReST-RL.</description>

      <title>Revealing Potential Biases in LLM-Based Recommender Systems in the Cold Start Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining. We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired probability metrics define a complete, universal space for statistical learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural, social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes ($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.</description>

      <title>Playing Markov Games Without Observing Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization under uncertainty is a fundamental problem in learning and decision-making, particularly in multi-agent systems. Previously, Feldman, Kalai, and Tennenholtz [2010] demonstrated the ability to efficiently compete in repeated symmetric two-player matrix games without observing payoffs, as long as the opponents actions are observed. In this paper, we introduce and formalize a new class of zero-sum symmetric Markov games, which extends the notion of symmetry from matrix games to the Markovian setting. We show that even without observing payoffs, a player who knows the transition dynamics and observes only the opponents sequence of actions can still compete against an adversary who may have complete knowledge of the game. We formalize three distinct notions of symmetry in this setting and show that, under these conditions, the learning problem can be reduced to an instance of online learning, enabling the player to asymptotically match the return of the opponent despite lacking payoff observations. Our algorithms apply to both matrix and Markov games, and run in polynomial time with respect to the size of the game and the number of episodes. Our work broadens the class of games in which robust learning is possible under severe informational disadvantage and deepens the connection between online learning and adversarial game theory.</description>

      <title>CVPD at QIAS 2025 Shared Task: An Efficient Encoder-Based Approach for Islamic Inheritance Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper, we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance, and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent. Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization(DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing DAPO (36.7/31.6), GRPO (36.7/32.1) and GSPO (40.0/34.9) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5), DAPO (20.0/15.3) and GSPO (16.7/9.9). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.</description>

      <title>Wild Refitting for Model-Free Excess Risk Evaluation of Opaque ML/AI Models under Bregman Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of evaluating the excess risk of classical penalized empirical risk minimization (ERM) with Bregman losses. We show that by leveraging the recently proposed wild refitting procedure (Wainwright, 2025), one can efficiently upper bound the excess risk through the so-called "wild optimism," without relying on the global structure of the underlying function class. This property makes our approach inherently model-free. Unlike conventional analyses, our framework operates with just one dataset and black-box access to the training procedure. The method involves randomized vector-valued symmetrization with an appropriate scaling of the prediction residues and constructing artificially modified outcomes, upon which we retrain a second predictor for excess risk estimation. We establish high-probability performance guarantees both under the fixed design setting and the random design setting, demonstrating that wild refitting under Bregman losses, with an appropriately chosen wild noise scale, yields a valid upper bound on the excess risk. This work thus is promising for theoretically evaluating modern opaque ML and AI models such as deep neural networks and large language models, where the model class is too complex for classical learning theory and empirical process techniques to apply.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Social Costs of Power Outages and Restoration Disparities Across Four U.S. Hurricanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multifaceted nature of disaster impact shows that densely populated areas contribute more to aggregate burden, while sparsely populated but heavily affected regions suffer disproportionately at the individual level. This study introduces a framework for quantifying the societal impacts of power outages by translating customer weighted outage exposure into deprivation measures, integrating welfare metrics with three recovery indicators, average outage days per customer, restoration duration, and relative restoration rate, computed from sequential EAGLE I observations and linked to Zip Code Tabulation Area demographics. Applied to four United States hurricanes, Beryl 2024 Texas, Helene 2024 Florida, Milton 2024 Florida, and Ida 2021 Louisiana, this standardized pipeline provides the first cross event, fine scale evaluation of outage impacts and their drivers. Results demonstrate regressive patterns with greater burdens in lower income areas, mechanistic analysis shows deprivation increases with longer restoration durations and decreases with faster restoration rates, explainable modeling identifies restoration duration as the dominant driver, and clustering reveals distinct recovery typologies not captured by conventional reliability metrics. This framework delivers a transferable method for assessing outage impacts and equity, comparative cross event evidence linking restoration dynamics to social outcomes, and actionable spatial analyses that support equity informed restoration planning and resilience investment.</description>

      <title>Efficient Virtuoso: A Latent Diffusion Transformer Model for Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems. While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the Efficient Virtuoso, a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, achieving a minimum Average Displacement Error (minADE) of 0.25. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</description>

      <title>ArcMemo: Abstract Reasoning Composition with Lifelong LLM Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. We evaluate on ARC-AGI, a benchmark that stresses compositional generalization and abstract reasoning, making it a natural fit for concept memory. Our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms fixed settings, supporting the hypothesis that accumulating and abstracting patterns enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

      <description>arXiv:2509.04899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, software has been developed that uses machine learning to mimic the style of a particular composer, such as J. S. Bach. However, since such software often adopts machine learning models with complex structures, it is difficult to analyze how the software understands the characteristics of the composer's music. In this study, we adopted J. S. Bach's music for training of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Since the structure of RBMs is simple, it allows us to investigate the internal states after learning. We found that the learned RBM is able to compose music.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic operator learning: generative modeling and uncertainty quantification for foundation models of differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context operator networks (ICON) are a class of operator learning methods based on the novel architectures of foundation models. Trained on a diverse set of datasets of initial and boundary conditions paired with corresponding solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ICON learns to map example condition-solution pairs of a given differential equation to an approximation of its solution operator. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that reveals ICON as implicitly performing Bayesian inference, where it computes the mean of the posterior predictive distribution over solution operators conditioned on the provided context, i.e., example condition-solution pairs. The formalism of random differential equations provides the probabilistic framework for describing the tasks ICON accomplishes while also providing a basis for understanding other multi-operator learning methods. This probabilistic perspective provides a basis for extending ICON to \emph{generative} settings, where one can sample from the posterior predictive distribution of solution operators. The generative formulation of ICON (GenICON) captures the underlying uncertainty in the solution operator, which enables principled uncertainty quantification in the solution predictions in operator learning.</description>

      <title>LatticeWorld: A Multimodal Large Language Model-Empowered Framework for Interactive Complex World Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

      <title>Beyond Linearity and Time-homogeneity: Relational Hyper Event Models with Time-Varying Non-Linear Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent technological advances have made it easier to collect large and complex networks of time-stamped relational events connecting two or more entities. Relational hyper-event models (RHEMs) aim to explain the dynamics of these events by modeling the event rate as a function of statistics based on past history and external information.
  However, despite the complexity of the data, most current RHEM approaches still rely on a linearity assumption to model this relationship. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more flexible model that allows the effects of statistics to vary non-linearly and over time. While time-varying and non-linear effects have been used in relational event modeling, we take this further by modeling joint time-varying and non-linear effects using tensor product smooths.
  We validate our methodology on both synthetic and empirical data. In particular, we use RHEMs to study how patterns of scientific collaboration and impact evolve over time. Our approach provides deeper insights into the dynamic factors driving relational hyper-events, allowing us to evaluate potential non-monotonic patterns that cannot be identified using linear models.</description>
