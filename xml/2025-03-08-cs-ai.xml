      <title>Fair Play in the Fast Lane: Integrating Sportsmanship into Autonomous Racing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous racing has gained significant attention as a platform for high-speed decision-making and motion control. While existing methods primarily focus on trajectory planning and overtaking strategies, the role of sportsmanship in ensuring fair competition remains largely unexplored. In human racing, rules such as the one-motion rule and the enough-space rule prevent dangerous and unsportsmanlike behavior. However, autonomous racing systems often lack mechanisms to enforce these principles, potentially leading to unsafe maneuvers. This paper introduces a bi-level game-theoretic framework to integrate sportsmanship (SPS) into versus racing. At the high level, we model racing intentions using a Stackelberg game, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is employed to derive optimal strategies. At the low level, vehicle interactions are formulated as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP), ensuring that all agents follow sportsmanship constraints while optimizing their trajectories. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enforcing sportsmanship rules while maintaining competitive performance. We analyze different scenarios where attackers and defenders adhere to or disregard sportsmanship rules and show how knowledge of these constraints influences strategic decision-making. This work highlights the importance of balancing competition and fairness in autonomous racing and provides a foundation for developing ethical and safe AI-driven racing systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting Team Performance from Communications in Simulated Search-and-Rescue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how individual traits influence team performance is valuable, but these traits are not always directly observable. Prior research has inferred traits like trust from behavioral data. We analyze conversational data to identify team traits and their correlation with teaming outcomes. Using transcripts from a Minecraft-based search-and-rescue experiment, we apply topic modeling and clustering to uncover key interaction patterns. Our findings show that variations in teaming outcomes can be explained through these inferences, with different levels of predictive power derived from individual traits and team dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning to Negotiate via Voluntary Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partial alignment and conflict of autonomous agents lead to mixed-motive scenarios in many real-world applications. However, agents may fail to cooperate in practice even when cooperation yields a better outcome. One well known reason for this failure comes from non-credible commitments. To facilitate commitments among agents for better cooperation, we define Markov Commitment Games (MCGs), a variant of commitment games, where agents can voluntarily commit to their proposed future plans. Based on MCGs, we propose a learnable commitment protocol via policy gradients. We further propose incentive-compatible learning to accelerate convergence to equilibria with better social welfare. Experimental results in challenging mixed-motive tasks demonstrate faster empirical convergence and higher returns for our method compared with its counterparts. Our code is available at https://github.com/shuhui-zhu/DCL.</description>

      <title>SED2AM: Solving Multi-Trip Time-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based frameworks, featuring Transformer-style policy networks, have demonstrated their efficacy across various vehicle routing problem (VRP) variants. However, the application of these methods to the multi-trip time-dependent vehicle routing problem (MTTDVRP) with maximum working hours constraints -- a pivotal element of urban logistics -- remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a DRL-based method called the Simultaneous Encoder and Dual Decoder Attention Model (SED2AM), tailored for the MTTDVRP with maximum working hours constraints. The proposed method introduces a temporal locality inductive bias to the encoding module of the policy networks, enabling it to effectively account for the time-dependency in travel distance or time. The decoding module of SED2AM includes a vehicle selection decoder that selects a vehicle from the fleet, effectively associating trips with vehicles for functional multi-trip routing. Additionally, this decoding module is equipped with a trip construction decoder leveraged for constructing trips for the vehicles. This policy model is equipped with two classes of state representations, fleet state and routing state, providing the information needed for effective route construction in the presence of maximum working hours constraints. Experimental results using real-world datasets from two major Canadian cities not only show that SED2AM outperforms the current state-of-the-art DRL-based and metaheuristic-based baselines but also demonstrate its generalizability to solve larger-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Pronunciation Teaching: Use and Beliefs of Foreign Language Teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pronunciation instruction in foreign language classrooms has often been an overlooked area of focus. With the widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its potential benefits, investigating how AI is utilized in pronunciation teaching and understanding the beliefs of teachers about this tool is essential for improving learning outcomes. This study aims to examine how AI use for pronunciation instruction varies across different demographic and professional factors among teachers, and how these factors, including AI use, influence the beliefs of teachers about AI. The study involved 117 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in-service teachers working in Cyprus, who completed an online survey designed to assess their beliefs about the effectiveness of AI, its drawbacks, and their willingness to integrate AI into their teaching practices. The results revealed that teachers were significantly more likely to agree on the perceived effectiveness of AI and their willingness to adopt it, compared to their concerns about its use. Furthermore, teachers working in higher education and adult education, as well as those who had received more extensive training, reported using AI more frequently in their teaching. Teachers who utilized AI more often expressed stronger agreement with its effectiveness, while those who had received more training were less likely to express concerns about its integration. Given the limited training that many teachers currently receive, these findings demonstrate the need for tailored training sessions that address the specific needs and concerns of educators, ultimately fostering the adoption of AI in pronunciation instruction.</description>

      <title>KidneyTalk-open: No-code Deployment of a Private Large Language Model with Medical Documentation-Enhanced Knowledge Database for Kidney Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving medical decision support for kidney disease requires localized deployment of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining clinical reasoning capabilities. Current solutions face three challenges: 1) Cloud-based LLMs pose data security risks; 2) Local model deployment demands technical expertise; 3) General LLMs lack mechanisms to integrate medical knowledge. Retrieval-augmented systems also struggle with medical document processing and clinical usability. We developed KidneyTalk-open, a desktop system integrating three technical components: 1) No-code deployment of state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source LLMs (such as DeepSeek-r1, Qwen2.5) via local inference engine; 2) Medical document processing pipeline combining context-aware chunking and intelligent filtering; 3) Adaptive Retrieval and Augmentation Pipeline (AddRep) employing agents collaboration for improving the recall rate of medical documents. A graphical interface was designed to enable clinicians to manage medical documents and conduct AI-powered consultations without technical expertise. Experimental validation on 1,455 challenging nephrology exam questions demonstrates AddRep's effectiveness: achieving 29.1% accuracy (+8.1% over baseline) with intelligent knowledge integration, while maintaining robustness through 4.9% rejection rate to suppress hallucinations. Comparative case studies with the mainstream products (AnythingLLM, Chatbox, GPT4ALL) demonstrate KidneyTalk-open's superior performance in real clinical query. KidneyTalk-open represents the first no-code medical LLM system enabling secure documentation-enhanced medical Q&amp;A on desktop. Its designs establishes a new framework for privacy-sensitive clinical AI applications. The system significantly lowers technical barriers while improving evidence traceability, enabling more medical staff or patients to use SOTA open-source LLMs conveniently.</description>

      <title>TIMER: Temporal Instruction Modeling and Evaluation for Longitudinal Clinical Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for assisting in medical tasks, yet processing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) presents unique challenges due to their longitudinal nature. While LLMs' capabilities to perform medical tasks continue to improve, their ability to reason over temporal dependencies across multiple patient visits and time frames remains unexplored. We introduce TIMER (Temporal Instruction Modeling and Evaluation for Longitudinal Clinical Records), a framework that incorporate instruction-response pairs grounding to different parts of a patient's record as a critical dimension in both instruction evaluation and tuning for longitudinal clinical records. We develop TIMER-Bench, the first time-aware benchmark that evaluates temporal reasoning capabilities over longitudinal EHRs, as well as TIMER-Instruct, an instruction-tuning methodology for LLMs to learn reasoning over time. We demonstrate that models fine-tuned with TIMER-Instruct improve performance by 7.3% on human-generated benchmarks and 9.2% on TIMER-Bench, indicating that temporal instruction-tuning improves model performance for reasoning over EHR.</description>

      <title>VirtualXAI: A User-Centric Framework for Explainability Assessment Leveraging GPT-Generated Personas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's data-driven era, computational systems generate vast amounts of data that drive the digital transformation of industries, where Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a key role. Currently, the demand for eXplainable AI (XAI) has increased to enhance the interpretability, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI models. However, evaluating XAI methods remains challenging: existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on quantitative properties such as fidelity, consistency, and stability without taking into account qualitative characteristics such as satisfaction and interpretability. In addition, practitioners face a lack of guidance in selecting appropriate datasets, AI models, and XAI methods -a major hurdle in human-AI collaboration. To address these gaps, we propose a framework that integrates quantitative benchmarking with qualitative user assessments through virtual personas based on the "Anthology" of backstories of the Large Language Model (LLM). Our framework also incorporates a content-based recommender system that leverages dataset-specific characteristics to match new input data with a repository of benchmarked datasets. This yields an estimated XAI score and provides tailored recommendations for both the optimal AI model and the XAI method for a given scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) have emerged as promising methodologies for addressing challenges in automated cyber defence (ACD). These techniques offer adaptive decision-making capabilities in high-dimensional, adversarial environments. This report provides a structured set of guidelines for cybersecurity professionals and researchers to assess the suitability of RL and MARL for specific use cases, considering factors such as explainability, exploration needs, and the complexity of multi-agent coordination. It also discusses key algorithmic approaches, implementation challenges, and real-world constraints, such as data scarcity and adversarial interference. The report further outlines open research questions, including policy optimality, agent cooperation levels, and the integration of MARL systems into operational cybersecurity frameworks. By bridging theoretical advancements and practical deployment, these guidelines aim to enhance the effectiveness of AI-driven cyber defence strategies.</description>

      <title>Mapping AI Benchmark Data to Quantitative Risk Estimates Through Expert Elicitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature and multiple experts point to many potential risks from large language models (LLMs), but there are still very few direct measurements of the actual harms posed. AI risk assessment has so far focused on measuring the models' capabilities, but the capabilities of models are only indicators of risk, not measures of risk. Better modeling and quantification of AI risk scenarios can help bridge this disconnect and link the capabilities of LLMs to tangible real-world harm. This paper makes an early contribution to this field by demonstrating how existing AI benchmarks can be used to facilitate the creation of risk estimates. We describe the results of a pilot study in which experts use information from Cybench, an AI benchmark, to generate probability estimates. We show that the methodology seems promising for this purpose, while noting improvements that can be made to further strengthen its application in quantitative AI risk assessment.</description>

      <title>AgentSafe: Safeguarding Large Language Model-based Multi-agent Systems via Hierarchical Data Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems are revolutionizing autonomous communication and collaboration, yet they remain vulnerable to security threats like unauthorized access and data breaches. To address this, we introduce AgentSafe, a novel framework that enhances MAS security through hierarchical information management and memory protection. AgentSafe classifies information by security levels, restricting sensitive data access to authorized agents. AgentSafe incorporates two components: ThreatSieve, which secures communication by verifying information authority and preventing impersonation, and HierarCache, an adaptive memory management system that defends against unauthorized access and malicious poisoning, representing the first systematic defense for agent memory. Experiments across various LLMs show that AgentSafe significantly boosts system resilience, achieving defense success rates above 80% under adversarial conditions. Additionally, AgentSafe demonstrates scalability, maintaining robust performance as agent numbers and information complexity grow. Results underscore effectiveness of AgentSafe in securing MAS and its potential for real-world application.</description>

      <title>Wider or Deeper? Scaling LLM Inference-Time Compute with Adaptive Branching Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose $\textit{Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS)}$, a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.</description>

      <title>From Idea to CAD: A Language Model-Driven Multi-Agent System for Collaborative Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating digital models using Computer Aided Design (CAD) is a process that requires in-depth expertise. In industrial product development, this process typically involves entire teams of engineers, spanning requirements engineering, CAD itself, and quality assurance. We present an approach that mirrors this team structure with a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based Multi Agent System, with access to parametric CAD tooling and tool documentation. Combining agents for requirements engineering, CAD engineering, and vision-based quality assurance, a model is generated automatically from sketches and/ or textual descriptions. The resulting model can be refined collaboratively in an iterative validation loop with the user. Our approach has the potential to increase the effectiveness of design processes, both for industry experts and for hobbyists who create models for 3D printing. We demonstrate the potential of the architecture at the example of various design tasks and provide several ablations that show the benefits of the architecture's individual components.</description>

      <title>Activation Space Interventions Can Be Transferred Between Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of representation universality in AI models reveals growing convergence across domains, modalities, and architectures. However, the practical applications of representation universality remain largely unexplored. We bridge this gap by demonstrating that safety interventions can be transferred between models through learned mappings of their shared activation spaces. We demonstrate this approach on two well-established AI safety tasks: backdoor removal and refusal of harmful prompts, showing successful transfer of steering vectors that alter the models' outputs in a predictable way. Additionally, we propose a new task, \textit{corrupted capabilities}, where models are fine-tuned to embed knowledge tied to a backdoor. This tests their ability to separate useful skills from backdoors, reflecting real-world challenges. Extensive experiments across Llama, Qwen and Gemma model families show that our method enables using smaller models to efficiently align larger ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autoencoder mappings between base and fine-tuned models can serve as reliable ``lightweight safety switches", allowing dynamic toggling between model behaviors.</description>

      <title>ToolFuzz -- Automated Agent Tool Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents leverage the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. To interface with an environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database APIs. As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical. However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding the agent's accuracy. Standard software testing approaches struggle to identify these errors as they are expressed in natural language. Thus, despite its importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool documentation for agents. To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first method for automated testing of tool documentations. ToolFuzz is designed to discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses. ToolFuzz can generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool description errors at a low false positive rate. Further, we present two straightforward prompt-engineering approaches. We evaluate all three tool testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment. We find that many publicly available tools suffer from underspecification. Specifically, we show that ToolFuzz identifies 20x more erroneous inputs compared to the prompt-engineering approaches, making it a key component for building reliable AI agents.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing for On-Demand DNN Inference in the Edge-AI Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of edge computing and AI gives rise to Edge-AI, which enables the deployment of real-time AI applications and services at the network edge. One of the fundamental research issues in Edge-AI is edge inference acceleration, which aims to realize low-latency high-accuracy DNN inference services by leveraging the fine-grained offloading of partitioned inference tasks from end devices to edge servers. However, existing research has yet to adopt a practical Edge-AI market perspective, which would systematically explore the personalized inference needs of AI users (e.g., inference accuracy, latency, and task complexity), the revenue incentives for AI service providers that offer edge inference services, and multi-stakeholder governance within a market-oriented context. To bridge this gap, we propose an Auction-based Edge Inference Pricing Mechanism (AERIA) for revenue maximization to tackle the multi-dimensional optimization problem of DNN model partition, edge inference pricing, and resource allocation. We investigate the multi-exit device-edge synergistic inference scheme for on-demand DNN inference acceleration, and analyse the auction dynamics amongst the AI service providers, AI users and edge infrastructure provider. Owing to the strategic mechanism design via randomized consensus estimate and cost sharing techniques, the Edge-AI market attains several desirable properties, including competitiveness in revenue maximization, incentive compatibility, and envy-freeness, which are crucial to maintain the effectiveness, truthfulness, and fairness of our auction outcomes. The extensive simulation experiments based on four representative DNN inference workloads demonstrate that our AERIA mechanism significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in revenue maximization, demonstrating the efficacy of AERIA for on-demand DNN inference in the Edge-AI market.</description>

      <title>SOLAR: Scalable Optimization of Large-scale Architecture for Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning but remain constrained by their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach, which struggles with complex tasks requiring more nuanced topological reasoning. We introduce SOLAR, Scalable Optimization of Large-scale Architecture for Reasoning, a framework that dynamically optimizes various reasoning topologies to enhance accuracy and efficiency.
  Our Topological Annotation Generation (TAG) system automates topological dataset creation and segmentation, improving post-training and evaluation. Additionally, we propose Topological-Scaling, a reward-driven framework that aligns training and inference scaling, equipping LLMs with adaptive, task-aware reasoning.
  SOLAR achieves substantial gains on MATH and GSM8K: +5% accuracy with Topological Tuning, +9% with Topological Reward, and +10.02% with Hybrid Scaling. It also reduces response length by over 5% for complex problems, lowering inference latency.
  To foster the reward system, we train a multi-task Topological Reward Model (M-TRM), which autonomously selects the best reasoning topology and answer in a single pass, eliminating the need for training and inference on multiple single-task TRMs (S-TRMs), thus reducing both training cost and inference latency. In addition, in terms of performance, M-TRM surpasses all S-TRMs, improving accuracy by +10% and rank correlation by +9%.
  To the best of our knowledge, SOLAR sets a new benchmark for scalable, high-precision LLM reasoning while introducing an automated annotation process and a dynamic reasoning topology competition mechanism.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Reasoning Robustness in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning such as DeepSeek, we for the first time identify a key dilemma in reasoning robustness and generalization: significant performance degradation on novel or incomplete data, suggesting a reliance on memorized patterns rather than systematic reasoning. Our closer examination reveals four key unique limitations underlying this issue:(1) Positional bias--models favor earlier queries in multi-query inputs but answering the wrong one in the latter (e.g., GPT-4o's accuracy drops from 75.8 percent to 72.8 percent); (2) Instruction sensitivity--performance declines by 5.0 to 7.5 percent in the Qwen2.5 Series and by 5.0 percent in DeepSeek-V3 with auxiliary guidance; (3) Numerical fragility--value substitution sharply reduces accuracy (e.g., GPT-4o drops from 97.5 percent to 82.5 percent, GPT-o1-mini drops from 97.5 percent to 92.5 percent); and (4) Memory dependence--models resort to guesswork when missing critical data. These findings further highlight the reliance on heuristic recall over rigorous logical inference, demonstrating challenges in reasoning robustness. To comprehensively investigate these robustness challenges, this paper introduces a novel benchmark, termed as Math-RoB, that exploits hallucinations triggered by missing information to expose reasoning gaps. This is achieved by an instruction-based approach to generate diverse datasets that closely resemble training distributions, facilitating a holistic robustness assessment and advancing the development of more robust reasoning frameworks.

      <title>ValuePilot: A Two-Phase Framework for Value-Driven Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), it poses challenges to ensure personalized decision-making in tasks that are not considered in training datasets. To address this issue, we propose ValuePilot, a two-phase value-driven decision-making framework comprising a dataset generation toolkit DGT and a decision-making module DMM trained on the generated data. DGT is capable of generating scenarios based on value dimensions and closely mirroring real-world tasks, with automated filtering techniques and human curation to ensure the validity of the dataset. In the generated dataset, DMM learns to recognize the inherent values of scenarios, computes action feasibility and navigates the trade-offs between multiple value dimensions to make personalized decisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, given human value preferences, our DMM most closely aligns with human decisions, outperforming Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-2-flash, Llama-3.1-405b and GPT-4o. This research is a preliminary exploration of value-driven decision-making. We hope it will stimulate interest in value-driven decision-making and personalized decision-making within the community.</description>

      <title>BIOSCAN-5M: A Multimodal Dataset for Insect Biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12723v6 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of an ongoing worldwide effort to comprehend and monitor insect biodiversity, this paper presents the BIOSCAN-5M Insect dataset to the machine learning community and establish several benchmark tasks. BIOSCAN-5M is a comprehensive dataset containing multi-modal information for over 5 million insect specimens, and it significantly expands existing image-based biological datasets by including taxonomic labels, raw nucleotide barcode sequences, assigned barcode index numbers, geographical, and size information. We propose three benchmark experiments to demonstrate the impact of the multi-modal data types on the classification and clustering accuracy. First, we pretrain a masked language model on the DNA barcode sequences of the BIOSCAN-5M dataset, and demonstrate the impact of using this large reference library on species- and genus-level classification performance. Second, we propose a zero-shot transfer learning task applied to images and DNA barcodes to cluster feature embeddings obtained from self-supervised learning, to investigate whether meaningful clusters can be derived from these representation embeddings. Third, we benchmark multi-modality by performing contrastive learning on DNA barcodes, image data, and taxonomic information. This yields a general shared embedding space enabling taxonomic classification using multiple types of information and modalities. The code repository of the BIOSCAN-5M Insect dataset is available at https://github.com/bioscan-ml/BIOSCAN-5M.</description>

      <title>M2-omni: Advancing Omni-MLLM for Comprehensive Modality Support with Competitive Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present M2-omni, a cutting-edge, open-source omni-MLLM that achieves competitive performance to GPT-4o. M2-omni employs a unified multimodal sequence modeling framework, which empowers Large Language Models(LLMs) to acquire comprehensive cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities. Specifically, M2-omni can process arbitrary combinations of audio, video, image, and text modalities as input, generating multimodal sequences interleaving with audio, image, or text outputs, thereby enabling an advanced and interactive real-time experience. The training of such an omni-MLLM is challenged by significant disparities in data quantity and convergence rates across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a step balance strategy during pre-training to handle the quantity disparities in modality-specific data. Additionally, a dynamically adaptive balance strategy is introduced during the instruction tuning stage to synchronize the modality-wise training progress, ensuring optimal convergence. Notably, we prioritize preserving strong performance on pure text tasks to maintain the robustness of M2-omni's language understanding capability throughout the training process. To our best knowledge, M2-omni is currently a very competitive open-source model to GPT-4o, characterized by its comprehensive modality and task support, as well as its exceptional performance. We expect M2-omni will advance the development of omni-MLLMs, thus facilitating future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Multimodal AI predicts clinical outcomes of drug combinations from preclinical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting clinical outcomes from preclinical data is essential for identifying safe and effective drug combinations. Current models rely on structural or target-based features to identify high-efficacy, low-toxicity drug combinations. However, these approaches fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically-relevant predictions. Here, we introduce MADRIGAL, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. MADRIGAL uses a transformer bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference--a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions. MADRIGAL performs virtual screening of anticancer drug combinations and supports polypharmacy management for type II diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It identifies transporter-mediated drug interactions. MADRIGAL predicts resmetirom, the first and only FDA-approved drug for MASH, among therapies with the most favorable safety profile. It supports personalized cancer therapy by integrating genomic profiles from cancer patients. Using primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models, it predicts the efficacy of personalized drug combinations. Integrating MADRIGAL with a large language model allows users to describe clinical outcomes in natural language, improving safety assessment by identifying potential adverse interactions and toxicity risks. MADRIGAL provides a multimodal approach for designing combination therapies with improved predictive accuracy and clinical relevance.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Model-based Compression of MIMO CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While neural lossy compression techniques have markedly advanced the efficiency of Channel State Information (CSI) compression and reconstruction for feedback in MIMO communications, efficient algorithms for more challenging and practical tasks-such as CSI compression for future channel prediction and reconstruction with relevant side information-remain underexplored, often resulting in suboptimal performance when existing methods are extended to these scenarios. To that end, we propose a novel framework for compression with side information, featuring an encoding process with fixed-rate compression using a trainable codebook for codeword quantization, and a decoding procedure modeled as a backward diffusion process conditioned on both the codeword and the side information. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms existing CSI compression algorithms, often yielding over twofold performance improvement by achieving comparable distortion at less than half the data rate of competing methods in certain scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of diffusion-based compression for practical deployment in communication systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Finetuning for Dimensional Speech Emotion Recognition in the Age of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate speech emotion recognition is essential for developing human-facing systems. Recent advancements have included finetuning large, pretrained transformer models like Wav2Vec 2.0. However, the finetuning process requires substantial computational resources, including high-memory GPUs and significant processing time. As the demand for accurate emotion recognition continues to grow, efficient finetuning approaches are needed to reduce the computational burden. Our study focuses on dimensional emotion recognition, predicting attributes such as activation (calm to excited) and valence (negative to positive). We present various finetuning techniques, including full finetuning, partial finetuning of transformer layers, finetuning with mixed precision, partial finetuning with caching, and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on the Wav2Vec 2.0 base model. We find that partial finetuning with mixed precision achieves performance comparable to full finetuning while increasing training speed by 67%. Caching intermediate representations further boosts efficiency, yielding an 88% speedup and a 71% reduction in learnable parameters. We recommend finetuning the final three transformer layers in mixed precision to balance performance and training efficiency, and adding intermediate representation caching for optimal speed with minimal performance trade-offs. These findings lower the barriers to finetuning speech emotion recognition systems, making accurate emotion recognition more accessible to a broader range of researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>BotUmc: An Uncertainty-Aware Twitter Bot Detection with Multi-view Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social bots have become widely known by users of social platforms. To prevent social bots from spreading harmful speech, many novel bot detections are proposed. However, with the evolution of social bots, detection methods struggle to give high-confidence answers for samples. This motivates us to quantify the uncertainty of the outputs, informing the confidence of the results. Therefore, we propose an uncertainty-aware bot detection method to inform the confidence and use the uncertainty score to pick a high-confidence decision from multiple views of a social network under different environments. Specifically, our proposed BotUmc uses LLM to extract information from tweets. Then, we construct a graph based on the extracted information, the original user information, and the user relationship and generate multiple views of the graph by causal interference. Lastly, an uncertainty loss is used to force the model to quantify the uncertainty of results and select the result with low uncertainty in one view as the final decision. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges for on-device inference due to high memory demands. Traditional methods to reduce memory usage often compromise performance and lack adaptability. We propose FlexInfer, an optimized offloading framework for on-device inference, addressing these issues with techniques like asynchronous prefetching, balanced memory locking, and flexible tensor preservation. These strategies enhance memory efficiency and mitigate I/O bottlenecks, ensuring high performance within user-specified resource constraints. Experiments demonstrate that FlexInfer significantly improves throughput under limited resources, achieving up to 12.5 times better performance than existing methods and facilitating the deployment of large models on resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Focal Search in Multi-Agent Path Finding with Tighter Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves finding collision-free paths for multiple agents while minimizing a cost function--an NP-hard problem. Bounded suboptimal methods like Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) and Explicit Estimation CBS (EECBS) balance solution quality with computational efficiency using focal search mechanisms. While effective, traditional focal search faces a limitation: the lower bound (LB) value determining which nodes enter the FOCAL list often increases slowly in early search stages, resulting in a constrained search space that delays finding valid solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel bounded suboptimal algorithm, double-ECBS (DECBS), to address this issue by first determining the maximum LB value and then employing a best-first search guided by this LB to find a collision-free path. Experimental results demonstrate that DECBS outperforms ECBS in most test cases and is compatible with existing optimization techniques. DECBS can reduce nearly 30% high-level CT nodes and 50% low-level focal search nodes. When agent density is moderate to high, DECBS achieves a 23.5% average runtime improvement over ECBS with identical suboptimality bounds and optimizations.</description>

      <title>Passive Heart Rate Monitoring During Smartphone Use in Everyday Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resting heart rate (RHR) is an important biomarker of cardiovascular health and mortality, but tracking it longitudinally generally requires a wearable device, limiting its availability. We present PHRM, a deep learning system for passive heart rate (HR) and RHR measurements during everyday smartphone use, using facial video-based photoplethysmography. Our system was developed using 225,773 videos from 495 participants and validated on 185,970 videos from 205 participants in laboratory and free-living conditions, representing the largest validation study of its kind. Compared to reference electrocardiogram, PHRM achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) &lt; 10% for HR measurements across three skin tone groups of light, medium and dark pigmentation; MAPE for each skin tone group was non-inferior versus the others. Daily RHR measured by PHRM had a mean absolute error &lt; 5 bpm compared to a wearable HR tracker, and was associated with known risk factors. These results highlight the potential of smartphones to enable passive and equitable heart health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Sarcasm Detection as a Catalyst: Improving Stance Detection with Cross-Target Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stance Detection (SD) has become a critical area of interest due to its applications in various contexts leading to increased research within NLP. Yet the subtlety and complexity of texts sourced from online platforms often containing sarcastic language pose significant challenges for SD algorithms in accurately determining the authors stance. This paper addresses this by employing sarcasm for SD. It also tackles the issue of insufficient annotated data for training SD models on new targets by conducting Cross-Target SD (CTSD). The proposed approach involves fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa models followed by concatenating additional deep learning layers. The approach is assessed against various State-Of-The-Art baselines for SD demonstrating superior performance using publicly available datasets. Notably our model outperforms the best SOTA models on both in-domain SD and CTSD tasks even before the incorporation of sarcasm-detection pre-training. The integration of sarcasm knowledge into the model significantly reduces misclassifications of sarcastic text elements in SD allowing our model to accurately predict 85% of texts that were previously misclassified without sarcasm-detection pre-training on in-domain SD. This enhancement contributes to an increase in the models average macro F1-score. The CTSD task achieves performance comparable to that of the in-domain task despite using a zero-shot finetuning. We also reveal that the success of the transfer-learning framework relies on the correlation between the lexical attributes of sarcasm detection and SD. This study represents the first exploration of sarcasm detection as an intermediate transfer-learning task within the context of SD while also leveraging the concatenation of BERT or RoBERTa with other deep-learning techniques. The proposed approach establishes a foundational baseline for future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Positive-Unlabeled Diffusion Models for Preventing Sensitive Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models but often generate sensitive data that are unwanted by users, mainly because the unlabeled training data frequently contain such sensitive data. Since labeling all sensitive data in the large-scale unlabeled training data is impractical, we address this problem by using a small amount of labeled sensitive data. In this paper, we propose positive-unlabeled diffusion models, which prevent the generation of sensitive data using unlabeled and sensitive data. Our approach can approximate the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for normal (negative) data using only unlabeled and sensitive (positive) data. Therefore, even without labeled normal data, we can maximize the ELBO for normal data and minimize it for labeled sensitive data, ensuring the generation of only normal data. Through experiments across various datasets and settings, we demonstrated that our approach can prevent the generation of sensitive images without compromising image quality.</description>

      <title>Rebalanced Multimodal Learning with Data-aware Unimodal Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the modality learning degeneration caused by modality imbalance, existing multimodal learning~(MML) approaches primarily attempt to balance the optimization process of each modality from the perspective of model learning. However, almost all existing methods ignore the modality imbalance caused by unimodal data sampling, i.e., equal unimodal data sampling often results in discrepancies in informational content, leading to modality imbalance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel MML approach called \underline{D}ata-aware \underline{U}nimodal \underline{S}ampling~(\method), which aims to dynamically alleviate the modality imbalance caused by sampling. Specifically, we first propose a novel cumulative modality discrepancy to monitor the multimodal learning process. Based on the learning status, we propose a heuristic and a reinforcement learning~(RL)-based data-aware unimodal sampling approaches to adaptively determine the quantity of sampled data at each iteration, thus alleviating the modality imbalance from the perspective of sampling. Meanwhile, our method can be seamlessly incorporated into almost all existing multimodal learning approaches as a plugin. Experiments demonstrate that \method~can achieve the best performance by comparing with diverse state-of-the-art~(SOTA) baselines.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Augmentation for Enhancing Harmful Algal Bloom Detection with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) pose severe threats to aquatic ecosystems and public health, resulting in substantial economic losses globally. Early detection is crucial but often hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets necessary for training reliable machine learning (ML) models. This study investigates the use of synthetic data augmentation using Gaussian Copulas to enhance ML-based HAB detection systems. Synthetic datasets of varying sizes (100-1,000 samples) were generated using relevant environmental features$\unicode{x2015}$water temperature, salinity, and UVB radiation$\unicode{x2015}$with corrected Chlorophyll-a concentration as the target variable. Experimental results demonstrate that moderate synthetic augmentation significantly improves model performance (RMSE reduced from 0.4706 to 0.1850; $p &lt; 0.001$). However, excessive synthetic data introduces noise and reduces predictive accuracy, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach to data augmentation. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic data to enhance HAB monitoring systems, offering a scalable and cost-effective method for early detection and mitigation of ecological and public health risks.</description>

      <title>Human Implicit Preference-Based Policy Fine-tuning for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in USV Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in solving complex problems involving cooperation and competition among agents, such as an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) swarm used in search and rescue, surveillance, and vessel protection. However, aligning system behavior with user preferences is challenging due to the difficulty of encoding expert intuition into reward functions. To address the issue, we propose a Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) approach for MARL that resolves credit-assignment challenges through an Agent-Level Feedback system categorizing feedback into intra-agent, inter-agent, and intra-team types. To overcome the challenges of direct human feedback, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) evaluator to validate our approach using feedback scenarios such as region constraints, collision avoidance, and task allocation. Our method effectively refines USV swarm policies, addressing key challenges in multi-agent systems while maintaining fairness and performance consistency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces a novel AI techniques as Mixture-of-Experts Transformers with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for voice health care applications on voice pathology detection. With the architectural innovations, we adopt advanced training paradigms inspired by reinforcement learning, namely Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-wise Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance model stability and performance. Experiments conducted on a synthetically generated voice pathology dataset demonstrate that our proposed models significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC compared to conventional approaches. These findings underscore the potential of integrating transformer architectures with novel training strategies to advance automated voice pathology detection and ultimately contribute to more effective healthcare delivery.

      <title>Multi-Agent Systems Powered by Large Language Models: Applications in Swarm Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the integration of large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent simulations by replacing the hard-coded programs of agents with LLM-driven prompts. The proposed approach is showcased in the context of two examples of complex systems from the field of swarm intelligence: ant colony foraging and bird flocking. Central to this study is a toolchain that integrates LLMs with the NetLogo simulation platform, leveraging its Python extension to enable communication with GPT-4o via the OpenAI API. This toolchain facilitates prompt-driven behavior generation, allowing agents to respond adaptively to environmental data. For both example applications mentioned above, we employ both structured, rule-based prompts and autonomous, knowledge-driven prompts. Our work demonstrates how this toolchain enables LLMs to study self-organizing processes and induce emergent behaviors within multi-agent environments, paving the way for new approaches to exploring intelligent systems and modeling swarm intelligence inspired by natural phenomena. We provide the code, including simulation files and data at https://github.com/crjimene/swarm_gpt.</description>

      <title>RiskAgent: Autonomous Medical AI Copilot for Generalist Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to various clinical applications has attracted growing research attention. However, real-world clinical decision-making differs significantly from the standardized, exam-style scenarios commonly used in current efforts. In this paper, we present the RiskAgent system to perform a broad range of medical risk predictions, covering over 387 risk scenarios across diverse complex diseases, e.g., cardiovascular disease and cancer. RiskAgent is designed to collaborate with hundreds of clinical decision tools, i.e., risk calculators and scoring systems that are supported by evidence-based medicine. To evaluate our method, we have built the first benchmark MedRisk specialized for risk prediction, including 12,352 questions spanning 154 diseases, 86 symptoms, 50 specialties, and 24 organ systems. The results show that our RiskAgent, with 8 billion model parameters, achieves 76.33% accuracy, outperforming the most recent commercial LLMs, o1, o3-mini, and GPT-4.5, and doubling the 38.39% accuracy of GPT-4o. On rare diseases, e.g., Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), RiskAgent outperforms o1 and GPT-4.5 by 27.27% and 45.46% accuracy, respectively. Finally, we further conduct a generalization evaluation on an external evidence-based diagnosis benchmark and show that our RiskAgent achieves the best results. These encouraging results demonstrate the great potential of our solution for diverse diagnosis domains. To improve the adaptability of our model in different scenarios, we have built and open-sourced a family of models ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our code, data, and models are all available at https://github.com/AI-in-Health/RiskAgent.</description>

      <title>Task-Agnostic Attacks Against Vision Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of security in machine learning mainly focuses on downstream task-specific attacks, where the adversarial example is obtained by optimizing a loss function specific to the downstream task. At the same time, it has become standard practice for machine learning practitioners to adopt publicly available pre-trained vision foundation models, effectively sharing a common backbone architecture across a multitude of applications such as classification, segmentation, depth estimation, retrieval, question-answering and more. The study of attacks on such foundation models and their impact to multiple downstream tasks remains vastly unexplored. This work proposes a general framework that forges task-agnostic adversarial examples by maximally disrupting the feature representation obtained with foundation models. We extensively evaluate the security of the feature representations obtained by popular vision foundation models by measuring the impact of this attack on multiple downstream tasks and its transferability between models.</description>

      <title>Not-Just-Scaling Laws: Towards a Better Understanding of the Downstream Impact of Language Model Design Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improvements in language model capabilities are often attributed to increasing model size or training data, but in some cases smaller models trained on curated data or with different architectural decisions can outperform larger ones trained on more tokens. What accounts for this? To quantify the impact of these design choices, we meta-analyze 92 open-source pretrained models across a wide array of scales, including state-of-the-art open-weights models as well as less performant models and those with less conventional design decisions. We find that by incorporating features besides model size and number of training tokens, we can achieve a relative 3-28% increase in ability to predict downstream performance compared with using scale alone. Analysis of model design decisions reveal insights into data composition, such as the trade-off between language and code tasks at 15-25\% code, as well as the better performance of some architectural decisions such as choosing rotary over learned embeddings. Broadly, our framework lays a foundation for more systematic investigation of how model development choices shape final capabilities.</description>

      <title>CREStE: Scalable Mapless Navigation with Internet Scale Priors and Counterfactual Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the long-horizon mapless navigation problem: enabling robots to traverse novel environments without relying on high-definition maps or precise waypoints that specify exactly where to navigate. Achieving this requires overcoming two major challenges -- learning robust, generalizable perceptual representations of the environment without pre-enumerating all possible navigation factors and forms of perceptual aliasing and utilizing these learned representations to plan human-aligned navigation paths. Existing solutions struggle to generalize due to their reliance on hand-curated object lists that overlook unforeseen factors, end-to-end learning of navigation features from scarce large-scale robot datasets, and handcrafted reward functions that scale poorly to diverse scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose CREStE, the first method that learns representations and rewards for addressing the full mapless navigation problem without relying on large-scale robot datasets or manually curated features. CREStE leverages visual foundation models trained on internet-scale data to learn continuous bird's-eye-view representations capturing elevation, semantics, and instance-level features. To utilize learned representations for planning, we propose a counterfactual-based loss and active learning procedure that focuses on the most salient perceptual cues by querying humans for counterfactual trajectory annotations in challenging scenes. We evaluate CREStE in kilometer-scale navigation tasks across six distinct urban environments. CREStE significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches with 70% fewer human interventions per mission, including a 2-kilometer mission in an unseen environment with just 1 intervention; showcasing its robustness and effectiveness for long-horizon mapless navigation.

      <title>De-skilling, Cognitive Offloading, and Misplaced Responsibilities: Potential Ironies of AI-Assisted Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI (GenAI) in design has sparked discussions about its benefits and unintended consequences. While AI is often framed as a tool for enhancing productivity by automating routine tasks, historical research on automation warns of paradoxical effects, such as de-skilling and misplaced responsibilities. To assess UX practitioners' perceptions of AI, we analyzed over 120 articles and discussions from UX-focused subreddits. Our findings indicate that while practitioners express optimism about AI reducing repetitive work and augmenting creativity, they also highlight concerns about over-reliance, cognitive offloading, and the erosion of critical design skills. Drawing from human-automation interaction literature, we discuss how these perspectives align with well-documented automation ironies and function allocation challenges. We argue that UX professionals should critically evaluate AI's role beyond immediate productivity gains and consider its long-term implications for creative autonomy and expertise. This study contributes empirical insights into practitioners' perspectives and links them to broader debates on automation in design.</description>

      <title>"Impressively Scary:" Exploring User Perceptions and Reactions to Unraveling Machine Learning Models in Social Media Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models deployed locally on social media applications are used for features, such as face filters which read faces in-real time, and they expose sensitive attributes to the apps. However, the deployment of machine learning models, e.g., when, where, and how they are used, in social media applications is opaque to users. We aim to address this inconsistency and investigate how social media user perceptions and behaviors change once exposed to these models. We conducted user studies (N=21) and found that participants were unaware to both what the models output and when the models were used in Instagram and TikTok, two major social media platforms. In response to being exposed to the models' functionality, we observed long term behavior changes in 8 participants. Our analysis uncovers the challenges and opportunities in providing transparency for machine learning models that interact with local user data.</description>

      <title>GlucoLens: Explainable Postprandial Blood Glucose Prediction from Diet and Physical Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Postprandial hyperglycemia, marked by the blood glucose level exceeding the normal range after meals, is a critical indicator of progression toward type 2 diabetes in prediabetic and healthy individuals. A key metric for understanding blood glucose dynamics after eating is the postprandial area under the curve (PAUC). Predicting PAUC in advance based on a person's diet and activity level and explaining what affects postprandial blood glucose could allow an individual to adjust their lifestyle accordingly to maintain normal glucose levels. In this paper, we propose GlucoLens, an explainable machine learning approach to predict PAUC and hyperglycemia from diet, activity, and recent glucose patterns. We conducted a five-week user study with 10 full-time working individuals to develop and evaluate the computational model. Our machine learning model takes multimodal data including fasting glucose, recent glucose, recent activity, and macronutrient amounts, and provides an interpretable prediction of the postprandial glucose pattern. Our extensive analyses of the collected data revealed that the trained model achieves a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 0.123. On average, GlucoLense with a Random Forest backbone provides a 16% better result than the baseline models. Additionally, GlucoLens predicts hyperglycemia with an accuracy of 74% and recommends different options to help avoid hyperglycemia through diverse counterfactual explanations.

      <title>COARSE: Collaborative Pseudo-Labeling with Coarse Real Labels for Off-Road Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous off-road navigation faces challenges due to diverse, unstructured environments, requiring robust perception with both geometric and semantic understanding. However, scarce densely labeled semantic data limits generalization across domains. Simulated data helps, but introduces domain adaptation issues. We propose COARSE, a semi-supervised domain adaptation framework for off-road semantic segmentation, leveraging sparse, coarse in-domain labels and densely labeled out-of-domain data. Using pretrained vision transformers, we bridge domain gaps with complementary pixel-level and patch-level decoders, enhanced by a collaborative pseudo-labeling strategy on unlabeled data. Evaluations on RUGD and Rellis-3D datasets show significant improvements of 9.7\% and 8.4\% respectively, versus only using coarse data. Tests on real-world off-road vehicle data in a multi-biome setting further demonstrate COARSE's applicability.</description>

      <title>WIP: Assessing the Effectiveness of ChatGPT in Preparatory Testing Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This innovative practice WIP paper describes a research study that explores the integration of ChatGPT into the software testing curriculum and evaluates its effectiveness compared to human-generated testing artifacts. In a Capstone Project course, students were tasked with generating preparatory testing artifacts using ChatGPT prompts, which they had previously created manually. Their understanding and the effectiveness of the Artificial Intelligence generated artifacts were assessed through targeted questions. The results, drawn from this in-class assignment at a North American community college indicate that while ChatGPT can automate many testing preparation tasks, it cannot fully replace human expertise. However, students, already familiar with Information Technology at the postgraduate level, found the integration of ChatGPT into their workflow to be straightforward. The study suggests that AI can be gradually introduced into software testing education to keep pace with technological advancements.</description>

      <title>All-atom Diffusion Transformers: Unified generative modelling of molecules and materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are the standard toolkit for generative modelling of 3D atomic systems. However, for different types of atomic systems - such as molecules and materials - the generative processes are usually highly specific to the target system despite the underlying physics being the same. We introduce the All-atom Diffusion Transformer (ADiT), a unified latent diffusion framework for jointly generating both periodic materials and non-periodic molecular systems using the same model: (1) An autoencoder maps a unified, all-atom representations of molecules and materials to a shared latent embedding space; and (2) A diffusion model is trained to generate new latent embeddings that the autoencoder can decode to sample new molecules or materials. Experiments on QM9 and MP20 datasets demonstrate that jointly trained ADiT generates realistic and valid molecules as well as materials, exceeding state-of-the-art results from molecule and crystal-specific models. ADiT uses standard Transformers for both the autoencoder and diffusion model, resulting in significant speedups during training and inference compared to equivariant diffusion models. Scaling ADiT up to half a billion parameters predictably improves performance, representing a step towards broadly generalizable foundation models for generative chemistry.

      <title>Training neural networks faster with minimal tuning using pre-computed lists of hyperparameters for NAdamW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If we want to train a neural network using any of the most popular optimization algorithms, we are immediately faced with a dilemma: how to set the various optimization and regularization hyperparameters? When computational resources are abundant, there are a variety of methods for finding good hyperparameter settings, but when resources are limited the only realistic choices are using standard default values of uncertain quality and provenance, or tuning only a couple of the most important hyperparameters via extremely limited handdesigned sweeps. Extending the idea of default settings to a modest tuning budget, Metz et al. (2020) proposed using ordered lists of well-performing hyperparameter settings, derived from a broad hyperparameter search on a large library of training workloads. However, to date, no practical and performant hyperparameter lists that generalize to representative deep learning workloads have been demonstrated. In this paper, we present hyperparameter lists for NAdamW derived from extensive experiments on the realistic workloads in the AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. Our hyperparameter lists also include values for basic regularization techniques (i.e. weight decay, label smoothing, and dropout). In particular, our best NAdamW hyperparameter list performs well on AlgoPerf held-out workloads not used to construct it, and represents a compelling turn-key approach to tuning when restricted to five or fewer trials. It also outperforms basic learning rate/weight decay sweeps and an off-the-shelf Bayesian optimization tool when restricted to the same budget.</description>

      <title>RetinalGPT: A Retinal Clinical Preference Conversational Assistant Powered by Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention for their remarkable ability to process and analyze non-textual data, such as images, videos, and audio. Notably, several adaptations of general-domain MLLMs to the medical field have been explored, including LLaVA-Med. However, these medical adaptations remain insufficiently advanced in understanding and interpreting retinal images. In contrast, medical experts emphasize the importance of quantitative analyses for disease detection and interpretation. This underscores a gap between general-domain and medical-domain MLLMs: while general-domain MLLMs excel in broad applications, they lack the specialized knowledge necessary for precise diagnostic and interpretative tasks in the medical field. To address these challenges, we introduce \textit{RetinalGPT}, a multimodal conversational assistant for clinically preferred quantitative analysis of retinal images. Specifically, we achieve this by compiling a large retinal image dataset, developing a novel data pipeline, and employing customized visual instruction tuning to enhance both retinal analysis and enrich medical knowledge. In particular, RetinalGPT outperforms MLLM in the generic domain by a large margin in the diagnosis of retinal diseases in 8 benchmark retinal datasets. Beyond disease diagnosis, RetinalGPT features quantitative analyses and lesion localization, representing a pioneering step in leveraging LLMs for an interpretable and end-to-end clinical research framework.

      <title>Subgraph Federated Learning for Local Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on graphs enables collaborative model training to enhance performance without compromising the privacy of each client. However, existing methods often overlook the mutable nature of graph data, which frequently introduces new nodes and leads to shifts in label distribution. Since they focus solely on performing well on each client's local data, they are prone to overfitting to their local distributions (i.e., local overfitting), which hinders their ability to generalize to unseen data with diverse label distributions. In contrast, our proposed method, FedLoG, effectively tackles this issue by mitigating local overfitting. Our model generates global synthetic data by condensing the reliable information from each class representation and its structural information across clients. Using these synthetic data as a training set, we alleviate the local overfitting problem by adaptively generalizing the absent knowledge within each local dataset. This enhances the generalization capabilities of local models, enabling them to handle unseen data effectively. Our model outperforms baselines in our proposed experimental settings, which are designed to measure generalization power to unseen data in practical scenarios.

      <title>Benchmarking Large Language Models on Multiple Tasks in Bioinformatics NLP with Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become important tools in solving biological problems, offering improvements in accuracy and adaptability over conventional methods. Several benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of these LLMs. However, current benchmarks can hardly evaluate the performance of these models across diverse tasks effectively. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive prompting-based benchmarking framework, termed Bio-benchmark, which includes 30 key bioinformatics tasks covering areas such as proteins, RNA, drugs, electronic health records, and traditional Chinese medicine. Using this benchmark, we evaluate six mainstream LLMs, including GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-70b, etc., using 0-shot and few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) settings without fine-tuning to reveal their intrinsic capabilities. To improve the efficiency of our evaluations, we demonstrate BioFinder, a new tool for extracting answers from LLM responses, which increases extraction accuracy by round 30% compared to existing methods. Our benchmark results show the biological tasks suitable for current LLMs and identify specific areas requiring enhancement. Furthermore, we propose targeted prompt engineering strategies for optimizing LLM performance in these contexts. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations for the development of more robust LLMs tailored for various biological applications. This work offers a comprehensive evaluation framework and robust tools to support the application of LLMs in bioinformatics.</description>

      <title>TextDoctor: Unified Document Image Inpainting via Patch Pyramid Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital versions of real-world text documents often suffer from issues like environmental corrosion of the original document, low-quality scanning, or human interference. Existing document restoration and inpainting methods typically struggle with generalizing to unseen document styles and handling high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we introduce TextDoctor, a novel unified document image inpainting method. Inspired by human reading behavior, TextDoctor restores fundamental text elements from patches and then applies diffusion models to entire document images instead of training models on specific document types. To handle varying text sizes and avoid out-of-memory issues, common in high-resolution documents, we propose using structure pyramid prediction and patch pyramid diffusion models. These techniques leverage multiscale inputs and pyramid patches to enhance the quality of inpainting both globally and locally. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on seven public datasets validated that TextDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoring various types of high-resolution document images.</description>

      <title>Continual Optimization with Symmetry Teleportation for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is a widely explored paradigm that enables the simultaneous learning of multiple tasks using a single model. Despite numerous solutions, the key issues of optimization conflict and task imbalance remain under-addressed, limiting performance. Unlike existing optimization-based approaches that typically reweight task losses or gradients to mitigate conflicts or promote progress, we propose a novel approach based on Continual Optimization with Symmetry Teleportation (COST). During MTL optimization, when an optimization conflict arises, we seek an alternative loss-equivalent point on the loss landscape to reduce conflict. Specifically, we utilize a low-rank adapter (LoRA) to facilitate this practical teleportation by designing convergent, loss-invariant objectives. Additionally, we introduce a historical trajectory reuse strategy to continually leverage the benefits of advanced optimizers. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. COST is a plug-and-play solution that enhances a wide range of existing MTL methods. When integrated with state-of-the-art methods, COST achieves superior performance.</description>

      <title>Uncovering inequalities in new knowledge learning by large language models across different languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) gradually become integral tools for problem solving in daily life worldwide, understanding linguistic inequality is becoming increasingly important. Existing research has primarily focused on static analyses that assess the disparities in the existing knowledge and capabilities of LLMs across languages. However, LLMs are continuously evolving, acquiring new knowledge to generate up-to-date, domain-specific responses. Investigating linguistic inequalities within this dynamic process is, therefore, also essential. In this paper, we explore inequalities in new knowledge learning by LLMs across different languages and four key dimensions: effectiveness, transferability, prioritization, and robustness. Through extensive experiments under two settings (in-context learning and fine-tuning) using both proprietary and open-source models, we demonstrate that low-resource languages consistently face disadvantages across all four dimensions. By shedding light on these disparities, we aim to raise awareness of linguistic inequalities in LLMs' new knowledge learning, fostering the development of more inclusive and equitable future LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of digitalization, various document images are being applied more extensively in production and daily life, and there is an increasingly urgent need for fast and accurate parsing of the content in document images. Therefore, this report presents PP-DocBee, a novel multimodal large language model designed for end-to-end document image understanding. First, we develop a data synthesis strategy tailored to document scenarios in which we build a diverse dataset to improve the model generalization. Then, we apply a few training techniques, including dynamic proportional sampling, data preprocessing, and OCR postprocessing strategies. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of PP-DocBee, achieving state-of-the-art results on English document understanding benchmarks and even outperforming existing open source and commercial models in Chinese document understanding.

      <title>Can We Optimize Deep RL Policy Weights as Trajectory Modeling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the optimal policy from a random network initialization is the theme of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). As the scale of DRL training increases, treating DRL policy network weights as a new data modality and exploring the potential becomes appealing and possible. In this work, we focus on the policy learning path in deep RL, represented by the trajectory of network weights of historical policies, which reflects the evolvement of the policy learning process. Taking the idea of trajectory modeling with Transformer, we propose Transformer as Implicit Policy Learner (TIPL), which processes policy network weights in an autoregressive manner. We collect the policy learning path data by running independent RL training trials, with which we then train our TIPL model. In the experiments, we demonstrate that TIPL is able to fit the implicit dynamics of policy learning and perform the optimization of policy network by inference.</description>

      <title>Chart-HQA: A Benchmark for Hypothetical Question Answering in Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention for their strong visual-semantic understanding. Most existing chart benchmarks evaluate MLLMs' ability to parse information from charts to answer questions.However, they overlook the inherent output biases of MLLMs, where models rely on their parametric memory to answer questions rather than genuinely understanding the chart content. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Chart Hypothetical Question Answering (HQA) task, which imposes assumptions on the same question to compel models to engage in counterfactual reasoning based on the chart content. Furthermore, we introduce HAI, a human-AI interactive data synthesis approach that leverages the efficient text-editing capabilities of LLMs alongside human expert knowledge to generate diverse and high-quality HQA data at a low cost. Using HAI, we construct Chart-HQA, a challenging benchmark synthesized from publicly available data sources. Evaluation results on 18 MLLMs of varying model sizes reveal that current models face significant generalization challenges and exhibit imbalanced reasoning performance on the HQA task.</description>

      <title>Disparities in LLM Reasoning Accuracy and Explanations: A Case Study on African American English</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks, leading to their widespread deployment. However, recent studies have highlighted concerning biases in these models, particularly in their handling of dialectal variations like African American English (AAE). In this work, we systematically investigate dialectal disparities in LLM reasoning tasks. We develop an experimental framework comparing LLM performance given Standard American English (SAE) and AAE prompts, combining LLM-based dialect conversion with established linguistic analyses. We find that LLMs consistently produce less accurate responses and simpler reasoning chains and explanations for AAE inputs compared to equivalent SAE questions, with disparities most pronounced in social science and humanities domains. These findings highlight systematic differences in how LLMs process and reason about different language varieties, raising important questions about the development and deployment of these systems in our multilingual and multidialectal world. Our code repository is publicly available at https://github.com/Runtaozhou/dialect_bias_eval.</description>

      <title>InterChat: Enhancing Generative Visual Analytics using Multimodal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative visual analytics systems has transformed data-driven insights, yet significant challenges persist in accurately interpreting users' analytical and interaction intents. While language inputs offer flexibility, they often lack precision, making the expression of complex intents inefficient, error-prone, and time-intensive. To address these limitations, we investigate the design space of multimodal interactions for generative visual analytics through a literature review and pilot brainstorming sessions. Building on these insights, we introduce a highly extensible workflow that integrates multiple LLM agents for intent inference and visualization generation. We develop InterChat, a generative visual analytics system that combines direct manipulation of visual elements with natural language inputs. This integration enables precise intent communication and supports progressive, visually driven exploratory data analyses. By employing effective prompt engineering, and contextual interaction linking, alongside intuitive visualization and interaction designs, InterChat bridges the gap between user interactions and LLM-driven visualizations, enhancing both interpretability and usability. Extensive evaluations, including two usage scenarios, a user study, and expert feedback, demonstrate the effectiveness of InterChat. Results show significant improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of handling complex visual analytics tasks, highlighting the potential of multimodal interactions to redefine user engagement and analytical depth in generative visual analytics.</description>

      <title>Generalizability of Neural Networks Minimizing Empirical Risk Based on Expressive Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of learning methods is generalization. Classic uniform generalization bounds, which rely on VC-dimension or Rademacher complexity, fail to explain the significant attribute that over-parameterized models in deep learning exhibit nice generalizability. On the other hand, algorithm-dependent generalization bounds, like stability bounds, often rely on strict assumptions. To establish generalizability under less stringent assumptions, this paper investigates the generalizability of neural networks that minimize or approximately minimize empirical risk. We establish a lower bound for population accuracy based on the expressiveness of these networks, which indicates that with an adequate large number of training samples and network sizes, these networks, including over-parameterized ones, can generalize effectively. Additionally, we provide a necessary condition for generalization, demonstrating that, for certain data distributions, the quantity of training data required to ensure generalization exceeds the network size needed to represent the corresponding data distribution. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into several phenomena in deep learning, including robust generalization, importance of over-parameterization, and effect of loss function on generalization.</description>

      <title>Simple Self Organizing Map with Visual Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various vision tasks. However, they tend to underperform on smaller datasets due to their inherent lack of inductive biases. Current approaches address this limitation implicitly-often by pairing ViTs with pretext tasks or by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to strengthen the prior. In contrast, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a widely adopted self-supervised framework, are inherently structured to preserve topology and spatial organization, making them a promising candidate to directly address the limitations of ViTs in limited or small training datasets. Despite this potential, equipping SOMs with modern deep learning architectures remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a novel exploration on how Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can empower each other, aiming to bridge this critical research gap. Our findings demonstrate that these architectures can synergistically enhance each other, leading to significantly improved performance in both unsupervised and supervised tasks. Code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>MTS: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Portfolio Management Framework with Time-Awareness and Short-Selling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio management remains a crucial challenge in finance, with traditional methods often falling short in complex and volatile market environments. While deep reinforcement approaches have shown promise, they still face limitations in dynamic risk management, exploitation of temporal markets, and incorporation of complex trading strategies such as short-selling. These limitations can lead to suboptimal portfolio performance, increased vulnerability to market volatility, and missed opportunities in capturing potential returns from diverse market conditions. This paper introduces a Deep Reinforcement Learning Portfolio Management Framework with Time-Awareness and Short-Selling (MTS), offering a robust and adaptive strategy for sustainable investment performance. This framework utilizes a novel encoder-attention mechanism to address the limitations by incorporating temporal market characteristics, a parallel strategy for automated short-selling based on market trends, and risk management through innovative Incremental Conditional Value at Risk, enhancing adaptability and performance. Experimental validation on five diverse datasets from 2019 to 2023 demonstrates MTS's superiority over traditional algorithms and advanced machine learning techniques. MTS consistently achieves higher cumulative returns, Sharpe, Omega, and Sortino ratios, underscoring its effectiveness in balancing risk and return while adapting to market dynamics. MTS demonstrates an average relative increase of 30.67% in cumulative returns and 29.33% in Sharpe ratio compared to the next best-performing strategies across various datasets.</description>

      <title>DM-Adapter: Domain-Aware Mixture-of-Adapters for Text-Based Person Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-based person retrieval (TPR) has gained significant attention as a fine-grained and challenging task that closely aligns with practical applications. Tailoring CLIP to person domain is now a emerging research topic due to the abundant knowledge of vision-language pretraining, but challenges still remain during fine-tuning: (i) Previous full-model fine-tuning in TPR is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting.(ii) Existing parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) for TPR lacks of fine-grained feature extraction. To address these issues, we propose Domain-Aware Mixture-of-Adapters (DM-Adapter), which unifies Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and PETL to enhance fine-grained feature representations while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, Sparse Mixture-of-Adapters is designed in parallel to MLP layers in both vision and language branches, where different experts specialize in distinct aspects of person knowledge to handle features more finely. To promote the router to exploit domain information effectively and alleviate the routing imbalance, Domain-Aware Router is then developed by building a novel gating function and injecting learnable domain-aware prompts. Extensive experiments show that our DM-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Benchmarking of Reasoning Capabilities in Code Large Language Models Under Data Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of code largelanguage models underscores the need for effective and transparent benchmarking of their reasoning capabilities. However, the current benchmarking approach heavily depends on publicly available, human-created datasets. The widespread use of these fixed benchmark datasets makes the benchmarking process to be static and thus particularly susceptible to data contamination, an unavoidable consequence of the extensive data collection processes used to train Code LLMs. Existing approaches that address data contamination often suffer from human effort limitations and imbalanced problem complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose \tool, a novel benchmarking suite for evaluating Code LLMs under potential data contamination. Given a seed programming problem, \tool employs multiple agents to extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating semantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation methods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs. Results show that \tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under contamination risks while generating diverse problem sets to ensure consistent and reliable evaluations.</description>

      <title>Ticktack : Long Span Temporal Alignment of Large Language Models Leveraging Sexagenary Cycle Time Expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from temporal misalignment issues especially across long span of time. The issue arises from knowing that LLMs are trained on large amounts of data where temporal information is rather sparse over long times, such as thousands of years, resulting in insufficient learning or catastrophic forgetting by the LLMs. This paper proposes a methodology named "Ticktack" for addressing the LLM's long-time span misalignment in a yearly setting. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the sexagenary year expression instead of the Gregorian year expression employed by LLMs, achieving a more uniform distribution in yearly granularity. Then, we employ polar coordinates to model the sexagenary cycle of 60 terms and the year order within each term, with additional temporal encoding to ensure LLMs understand them. Finally, we present a temporal representational alignment approach for post-training LLMs that effectively distinguishes time points with relevant knowledge, hence improving performance on time-related tasks, particularly over a long period. We also create a long time span benchmark for evaluation. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Robust Multi-View Learning via Representation Fusion of Sample-Level Attention and Alignment of Simulated Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, multi-view learning (MVL) has garnered significant attention due to its ability to fuse discriminative information from multiple views. However, real-world multi-view datasets are often heterogeneous and imperfect, which usually makes MVL methods designed for specific combinations of views lack application potential and limits their effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel robust MVL method (namely RML) with simultaneous representation fusion and alignment. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective multi-view transformer fusion network where we transform heterogeneous multi-view data into homogeneous word embeddings, and then integrate multiple views by the sample-level attention mechanism to obtain a fused representation. Furthermore, we propose a simulated perturbation based multi-view contrastive learning framework that dynamically generates the noise and unusable perturbations for simulating imperfect data conditions. The simulated noisy and unusable data obtain two distinct fused representations, and we utilize contrastive learning to align them for learning discriminative and robust representations. Our RML is self-supervised and can also be applied for downstream tasks as a regularization. In experiments, we employ it in unsupervised multi-view clustering, noise-label classification, and as a plug-and-play module for cross-modal hashing retrieval. Extensive comparison experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of RML.</description>

      <title>CA-W3D: Leveraging Context-Aware Knowledge for Weakly Supervised Monocular 3D Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly supervised monocular 3D detection, while less annotation-intensive, often struggles to capture the global context required for reliable 3D reasoning. Conventional label-efficient methods focus on object-centric features, neglecting contextual semantic relationships that are critical in complex scenes. In this work, we propose a Context-Aware Weak Supervision for Monocular 3D object detection, namely CA-W3D, to address this limitation in a two-stage training paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a pre-training stage employing Region-wise Object Contrastive Matching (ROCM), which aligns regional object embeddings derived from a trainable monocular 3D encoder and a frozen open-vocabulary 2D visual grounding model. This alignment encourages the monocular encoder to discriminate scene-specific attributes and acquire richer contextual knowledge. In the second stage, we incorporate a pseudo-label training process with a Dual-to-One Distillation (D2OD) mechanism, which effectively transfers contextual priors into the monocular encoder while preserving spatial fidelity and maintaining computational efficiency during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on the public KITTI benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing the SoTA method over all metrics, highlighting the importance of contextual-aware knowledge in weakly-supervised monocular 3D detection.</description>

      <title>Unseen Fake News Detection Through Casual Debiasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media poses significant risks, necessitating timely and accurate detection. However, existing methods struggle with unseen news due to their reliance on training data from past events and domains, leaving the challenge of detecting novel fake news largely unresolved. To address this, we identify biases in training data tied to specific domains and propose a debiasing solution FNDCD. Originating from causal analysis, FNDCD employs a reweighting strategy based on classification confidence and propagation structure regularization to reduce the influence of domain-specific biases, enhancing the detection of unseen fake news. Experiments on real-world datasets with non-overlapping news domains demonstrate FNDCD's effectiveness in improving generalization across domains.</description>

      <title>Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to model user preferences based on historical behavior sequences, which is crucial for various online platforms. Data sparsity remains a significant challenge in this area as most users have limited interactions and many items receive little attention. To mitigate this issue, contrastive learning has been widely adopted. By constructing positive sample pairs from the data itself and maximizing their agreement in the embedding space,it can leverage available data more effectively. Constructing reasonable positive sample pairs is crucial for the success of contrastive learning. However, current approaches struggle to generate reliable positive pairs as they either rely on representations learned from inherently sparse collaborative signals or use random perturbations which introduce significant uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL), which leverages semantic information to improve the reliability of contrastive samples. SRA-CL comprises two main components: (1) Cross-Sequence Contrastive Learning via User Semantic Retrieval, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to understand diverse user preferences and retrieve semantically similar users to form reliable positive samples through a learnable sample synthesis method; and (2) Intra-Sequence Contrastive Learning via Item Semantic Retrieval, which employs LLMs to comprehend items and retrieve similar items to perform semantic-based item substitution, thereby creating semantically consistent augmented views for contrastive learning. SRA-CL is plug-and-play and can be integrated into standard sequential recommendation models. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>The Role of Visual Modality in Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning: Challenges and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on multimodal mathematical reasoning, particularly emphasizing the creation of relevant datasets and benchmarks. Despite this, the role of visual information in reasoning has been underexplored. Our findings show that existing multimodal mathematical models minimally leverage visual information, and model performance remains largely unaffected by changes to or removal of images in the dataset. We attribute this to the dominance of textual information and answer options that inadvertently guide the model to correct answers. To improve evaluation methods, we introduce the HC-M3D dataset, specifically designed to require image reliance for problem-solving and to challenge models with similar, yet distinct, images that change the correct answer. In testing leading models, their failure to detect these subtle visual differences suggests limitations in current visual perception capabilities. Additionally, we observe that the common approach of improving general VQA capabilities by combining various types of image encoders does not contribute to math reasoning performance. This finding also presents a challenge to enhancing visual reliance during math reasoning. Our benchmark and code would be available at \href{https://github.com/Yufang-Liu/visual_modality_role}{https://github.com/Yufang-Liu/visual\_modality\_role}.</description>

      <title>Towards Intelligent Transportation with Pedestrians and Vehicles In-the-Loop: A Surveillance Video-Assisted Federated Digital Twin Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), incorporating pedestrians and vehicles in-the-loop is crucial for developing realistic and safe traffic management solutions. However, there is falls short of simulating complex real-world ITS scenarios, primarily due to the lack of a digital twin implementation framework for characterizing interactions between pedestrians and vehicles at different locations in different traffic environments. In this article, we propose a surveillance video assisted federated digital twin (SV-FDT) framework to empower ITSs with pedestrians and vehicles in-the-loop. Specifically, SVFDT builds comprehensive pedestrian-vehicle interaction models by leveraging multi-source traffic surveillance videos. Its architecture consists of three layers: (i) the end layer, which collects traffic surveillance videos from multiple sources; (ii) the edge layer, responsible for semantic segmentation-based visual understanding, twin agent-based interaction modeling, and local digital twin system (LDTS) creation in local regions; and (iii) the cloud layer, which integrates LDTSs across different regions to construct a global DT model in realtime. We analyze key design requirements and challenges and present core guidelines for SVFDT's system implementation. A testbed evaluation demonstrates its effectiveness in optimizing traffic management. Comparisons with traditional terminal-server frameworks highlight SV-FDT's advantages in mirroring delays, recognition accuracy, and subjective evaluation. Finally, we identify some open challenges and discuss future research directions.</description>

      <title>CrowdHMTware: A Cross-level Co-adaptation Middleware for Context-aware Mobile DL Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many deep learning (DL) powered mobile and wearable applications today continuously and unobtrusively sensing the ambient surroundings to enhance all aspects of human lives.To enable robust and private mobile sensing, DL models are often deployed locally on resource-constrained mobile devices using techniques such as model compression or offloading.However, existing methods, either front-end algorithm level (i.e. DL model compression/partitioning) or back-end scheduling level (i.e. operator/resource scheduling), cannot be locally online because they require offline retraining to ensure accuracy or rely on manually pre-defined strategies, struggle with dynamic adaptability.The primary challenge lies in feeding back runtime performance from the back-end level to the front-end level optimization decision. Moreover, the adaptive mobile DL model porting middleware with cross-level co-adaptation is less explored, particularly in mobile environments with diversity and dynamics. In response, we introduce CrowdHMTware, a dynamic context-adaptive DL model deployment middleware for heterogeneous mobile devices. It establishes an automated adaptation loop between cross-level functional components, i.e. elastic inference, scalable offloading, and model-adaptive engine, enhancing scalability and adaptability. Experiments with four typical tasks across 15 platforms and a real-world case study demonstrate that CrowdHMTware can effectively scale DL model, offloading, and engine actions across diverse platforms and tasks. It hides run-time system issues from developers, reducing the required developer expertise.</description>

      <title>MASTER: Multimodal Segmentation with Text Prompts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RGB-Thermal fusion is a potential solution for various weather and light conditions in challenging scenarios. However, plenty of studies focus on designing complex modules to fuse different modalities. With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), valuable information can be more effectively extracted from natural language. Therefore, we aim to leverage the advantages of large language models to design a structurally simple and highly adaptable multimodal fusion model architecture. We proposed MultimodAl Segmentation with TExt PRompts (MASTER) architecture, which integrates LLM into the fusion of RGB-Thermal multimodal data and allows complex query text to participate in the fusion process. Our model utilizes a dual-path structure to extract information from different modalities of images. Additionally, we employ LLM as the core module for multimodal fusion, enabling the model to generate learnable codebook tokens from RGB, thermal images, and textual information. A lightweight image decoder is used to obtain semantic segmentation results. The proposed MASTER performs exceptionally well in benchmark tests across various automated driving scenarios, yielding promising results.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Decoupled Synergetic Learning: An MLLM based Collaborative Approach to Few-shot Multimodal Dialogue Intention Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot multimodal dialogue intention recognition is a critical challenge in the e-commerce domainn. Previous methods have primarily enhanced model classification capabilities through post-training techniques. However, our analysis reveals that training for few-shot multimodal dialogue intention recognition involves two interconnected tasks, leading to a seesaw effect in multi-task learning. This phenomenon is attributed to knowledge interference stemming from the superposition of weight matrix updates during the training process. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge-Decoupled Synergetic Learning (KDSL), which mitigates these issues by utilizing smaller models to transform knowledge into interpretable rules, while applying the post-training of larger models. By facilitating collaboration between the large and small multimodal large language models for prediction, our approach demonstrates significant improvements. Notably, we achieve outstanding results on two real Taobao datasets, with enhancements of 6.37\% and 6.28\% in online weighted F1 scores compared to the state-of-the-art method, thereby validating the efficacy of our framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Reinforcement Learning in the Presence of Epistemic Ambivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of online decision-making under uncertainty stems from the requirement of finding a balance between exploiting known strategies and exploring new possibilities. Naturally, the uncertainty type plays a crucial role in developing decision-making strategies that manage complexity effectively. In this paper, we focus on a specific form of uncertainty known as epistemic ambivalence (EA), which emerges from conflicting pieces of evidence or contradictory experiences. It creates a delicate interplay between uncertainty and confidence, distinguishing it from epistemic uncertainty that typically diminishes with new information. Indeed, ambivalence can persist even after additional knowledge is acquired. To address this phenomenon, we propose a novel framework, called the epistemically ambivalent Markov decision process (EA-MDP), aiming to understand and control EA in decision-making processes. This framework incorporates the concept of a quantum state from the quantum mechanics formalism, and its core is to assess the probability and reward of every possible outcome. We calculate the reward function using quantum measurement techniques and prove the existence of an optimal policy and an optimal value function in the EA-MDP framework. We also propose the EA-epsilon-greedy Q-learning algorithm. To evaluate the impact of EA on decision-making and the expedience of our framework, we study two distinct experimental setups, namely the two-state problem and the lattice problem. Our results show that using our methods, the agent converges to the optimal policy in the presence of EA.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Clustering for Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well adopted paradigm of decentralized learning that allows training one model from multiple sources without the need to directly transfer data between participating clients. Since its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous sub-fields that deal with application-specific issues, be it data heterogeneity or resource allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), is dealing with the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to deliver personalized models. Although few remarkable works have been published in this domain, the problem is still largely unexplored, as its basic assumption and settings are slightly different from standard FL. In this work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on the computation of cosine similarity between gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over thirty different tasks on three benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>How to Mitigate Overfitting in Weak-to-strong Generalization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning powerful AI models on tasks that surpass human evaluation capabilities is the central problem of \textbf{superalignment}. To address this problem, weak-to-strong generalization aims to elicit the capabilities of strong models through weak supervisors and ensure that the behavior of strong models aligns with the intentions of weak supervisors without unsafe behaviors such as deception. Although weak-to-strong generalization exhibiting certain generalization capabilities, strong models exhibit significant overfitting in weak-to-strong generalization: Due to the strong fit ability of strong models, erroneous labels from weak supervisors may lead to overfitting in strong models. In addition, simply filtering out incorrect labels may lead to a degeneration in question quality, resulting in a weak generalization ability of strong models on hard questions. To mitigate overfitting in weak-to-strong generalization, we propose a two-stage framework that simultaneously improves the quality of supervision signals and the quality of input questions. Experimental results in three series of large language models and two mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly improves PGR compared to naive weak-to-strong generalization, even achieving up to 100\% PGR on some models.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Retention for Continual Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose DRAGO, a novel approach for continual model-based reinforcement learning aimed at improving the incremental development of world models across a sequence of tasks that differ in their reward functions but not the state space or dynamics. DRAGO comprises two key components: Synthetic Experience Rehearsal, which leverages generative models to create synthetic experiences from past tasks, allowing the agent to reinforce previously learned dynamics without storing data, and Regaining Memories Through Exploration, which introduces an intrinsic reward mechanism to guide the agent toward revisiting relevant states from prior tasks. Together, these components enable the agent to maintain a comprehensive and continually developing world model, facilitating more effective learning and adaptation across diverse environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DRAGO is able to preserve knowledge across tasks, achieving superior performance in various continual learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>How to Move Your Dragon: Text-to-Motion Synthesis for Large-Vocabulary Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion synthesis for diverse object categories holds great potential for 3D content creation but remains underexplored due to two key challenges: (1) the lack of comprehensive motion datasets that include a wide range of high-quality motions and annotations, and (2) the absence of methods capable of handling heterogeneous skeletal templates from diverse objects. To address these challenges, we contribute the following: First, we augment the Truebones Zoo dataset, a high-quality animal motion dataset covering over 70 species, by annotating it with detailed text descriptions, making it suitable for text-based motion synthesis. Second, we introduce rig augmentation techniques that generate diverse motion data while preserving consistent dynamics, enabling models to adapt to various skeletal configurations. Finally, we redesign existing motion diffusion models to dynamically adapt to arbitrary skeletal templates, enabling motion synthesis for a diverse range of objects with varying structures. Experiments show that our method learns to generate high-fidelity motions from textual descriptions for diverse and even unseen objects, setting a strong foundation for motion synthesis across diverse object categories and skeletal templates.

      <description>arXiv:2503.04258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many studies combine text and audio to capture multi-modal information but they overlook the model's generalization ability on new datasets. Introducing new datasets may affect the feature space of the original dataset, leading to catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, large model parameters can significantly impact training performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel task called Text-Audio Incremental Learning (TAIL) task for text-audio retrieval, and propose a new method, PTAT, Prompt Tuning for Audio-Text incremental learning. This method utilizes prompt tuning to optimize the model parameters while incorporating an audio-text similarity and feature distillation module to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We benchmark our method and previous incremental learning methods on AudioCaps, Clotho, BBC Sound Effects and Audioset datasets, and our method outperforms previous methods significantly, particularly demonstrating stronger resistance to forgetting on older datasets. Compared to the full-parameters Finetune (Sequential) method, our model only requires 2.42\% of its parameters, achieving 4.46\% higher performance.</description>

      <title>Prompt Programming: A Platform for Dialogue-based Computational Problem Solving with Generative AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing students increasingly rely on generative AI tools for programming assistance, often without formal instruction or guidance. This highlights a need to teach students how to effectively interact with AI models, particularly through natural language prompts, to generate and critically evaluate code for solving computational tasks. To address this, we developed a novel platform for prompt programming that enables authentic dialogue-based interactions, supports problems involving multiple interdependent functions, and offers on-request execution of generated code. Data analysis from over 900 students in an introductory programming course revealed high engagement, with the majority of prompts occurring within multi-turn dialogues. Problems with multiple interdependent functions encouraged iterative refinement, with progression graphs highlighting several common strategies. Students were highly selective about the code they chose to test, suggesting that on-request execution of generated code promoted critical thinking. Given the growing importance of learning dialogue-based programming with AI, we provide this tool as a publicly accessible resource, accompanied by a corpus of programming problems for educational use.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Robotic Manipulation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex HumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4, a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria, creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI in Time-Sensitive Scenarios: Prefetched Offline Explanation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As predictive machine learning models become increasingly adopted and advanced, their role has evolved from merely predicting outcomes to actively shaping them. This evolution has underscored the importance of Trustworthy AI, highlighting the necessity to extend our focus beyond mere accuracy and toward a comprehensive understanding of these models' behaviors within the specific contexts of their applications. To further progress in explainability, we introduce Poem, Prefetched Offline Explanation Model, a model-agnostic, local explainability algorithm for image data. The algorithm generates exemplars, counterexemplars and saliency maps to provide quick and effective explanations suitable for time-sensitive scenarios. Leveraging an existing local algorithm, \poem{} infers factual and counterfactual rules from data to create illustrative examples and opposite scenarios with an enhanced stability by design. A novel mechanism then matches incoming test points with an explanation base and produces diverse exemplars, informative saliency maps and believable counterexemplars. Experimental results indicate that Poem outperforms its predecessor Abele in speed and ability to generate more nuanced and varied exemplars alongside more insightful saliency maps and valuable counterexemplars.</description>

      <title>How Do Hackathons Foster Creativity? Towards AI Collaborative Evaluation of Creativity at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hackathons have become popular collaborative events for accelerating the development of creative ideas and prototypes. There are several case studies showcasing creative outcomes across domains such as industry, education, and research. However, there are no large-scale studies on creativity in hackathons which can advance theory on how hackathon formats lead to creative outcomes. We conducted a computational analysis of 193,353 hackathon projects. By operationalizing creativity through usefulness and novelty, we refined our dataset to 10,363 projects, allowing us to analyze how participant characteristics, collaboration patterns, and hackathon setups influence the development of creative projects. The contribution of our paper is twofold: We identified means for organizers to foster creativity in hackathons. We also explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to augment the evaluation of creative outcomes and discuss challenges and opportunities of doing this, which has implications for creativity research at large.</description>

      <title>Malware Detection at the Edge with Lightweight LLMs: A Performance Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of malware attacks calls for the development of innovative detection methods, especially in resource-constrained edge computing. Traditional detection techniques struggle to keep up with modern malware's sophistication and adaptability, prompting a shift towards advanced methodologies like those leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced malware detection. However, deploying LLMs for malware detection directly at edge devices raises several challenges, including ensuring accuracy in constrained environments and addressing edge devices' energy and computational limits. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes an architecture leveraging lightweight LLMs' strengths while addressing limitations like reduced accuracy and insufficient computational power. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight LLM-based approach for edge computing, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation using several state-of-the-art lightweight LLMs. We test them with several publicly available datasets specifically designed for edge and IoT scenarios and different edge nodes with varying computational power and characteristics.</description>

      <title>Provable Robust Overfitting Mitigation in Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) optimizes against worst-case distributional shifts within a specified uncertainty set, leading to enhanced generalization on unseen adversarial examples, compared to standard adversarial training which focuses on pointwise adversarial perturbations. However, WDRO still suffers fundamentally from the robust overfitting problem, as it does not consider statistical error. We address this gap by proposing a novel robust optimization framework under a new uncertainty set for adversarial noise via Wasserstein distance and statistical error via Kullback-Leibler divergence, called the Statistically Robust WDRO. We establish a robust generalization bound for the new optimization framework, implying that out-of-distribution adversarial performance is at least as good as the statistically robust training loss with high probability. Furthermore, we derive conditions under which Stackelberg and Nash equilibria exist between the learner and the adversary, giving an optimal robust model in certain sense. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates robust overfitting and enhances robustness within the framework of WDRO.</description>

      <title>Solving Word-Sense Disambiguation and Word-Sense Induction with Dictionary Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many less-resourced languages struggle with a lack of large, task-specific datasets that are required for solving relevant tasks with modern transformer-based large language models (LLMs). On the other hand, many linguistic resources, such as dictionaries, are rarely used in this context despite their large information contents. We show how LLMs can be used to extend existing language resources in less-resourced languages for two important tasks: word-sense disambiguation (WSD) and word-sense induction (WSI). We approach the two tasks through the related but much more accessible word-in-context (WiC) task where, given a pair of sentences and a target word, a classification model is tasked with predicting whether the sense of a given word differs between sentences. We demonstrate that a well-trained model for this task can distinguish between different word senses and can be adapted to solve the WSD and WSI tasks. The advantage of using the WiC task, instead of directly predicting senses, is that the WiC task does not need pre-constructed sense inventories with a sufficient number of examples for each sense, which are rarely available in less-resourced languages. We show that sentence pairs for the WiC task can be successfully generated from dictionary examples using LLMs. The resulting prediction models outperform existing models on WiC, WSD, and WSI tasks. We demonstrate our methodology on the Slovene language, where a monolingual dictionary is available, but word-sense resources are tiny.</description>

      <title>scDD: Latent Codes Based scRNA-seq Dataset Distillation with Foundation Model Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has profiled hundreds of millions of human cells across organs, diseases, development and perturbations to date. However, the high-dimensional sparsity, batch effect noise, category imbalance, and ever-increasing data scale of the original sequencing data pose significant challenges for multi-center knowledge transfer, data fusion, and cross-validation between scRNA-seq datasets. To address these barriers, (1) we first propose a latent codes-based scRNA-seq dataset distillation framework named scDD, which transfers and distills foundation model knowledge and original dataset information into a compact latent space and generates synthetic scRNA-seq dataset by a generator to replace the original dataset. Then, (2) we propose a single-step conditional diffusion generator named SCDG, which perform single-step gradient back-propagation to help scDD optimize distillation quality and avoid gradient decay caused by multi-step back-propagation. Meanwhile, SCDG ensures the scRNA-seq data characteristics and inter-class discriminability of the synthetic dataset through flexible conditional control and generation quality assurance. Finally, we propose a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of scRNA-seq dataset distillation in different data analysis tasks. It is validated that our proposed method can achieve 7.61% absolute and 15.70% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average task.</description>

      <title>A Generalist Cross-Domain Molecular Learning Framework for Structure-Based Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure-based drug discovery (SBDD) is a systematic scientific process that develops new drugs by leveraging the detailed physical structure of the target protein. Recent advancements in pre-trained models for biomolecules have demonstrated remarkable success across various biochemical applications, including drug discovery and protein engineering. However, in most approaches, the pre-trained models primarily focus on the characteristics of either small molecules or proteins, without delving into their binding interactions which are essential cross-domain relationships pivotal to SBDD. To fill this gap, we propose a general-purpose foundation model named BIT (an abbreviation for Biomolecular Interaction Transformer), which is capable of encoding a range of biochemical entities, including small molecules, proteins, and protein-ligand complexes, as well as various data formats, encompassing both 2D and 3D structures. Specifically, we introduce Mixture-of-Domain-Experts (MoDE) to handle the biomolecules from diverse biochemical domains and Mixture-of-Structure-Experts (MoSE) to capture positional dependencies in the molecular structures. The proposed mixture-of-experts approach enables BIT to achieve both deep fusion and domain-specific encoding, effectively capturing fine-grained molecular interactions within protein-ligand complexes. Then, we perform cross-domain pre-training on the shared Transformer backbone via several unified self-supervised denoising tasks. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that BIT achieves exceptional performance in downstream tasks, including binding affinity prediction, structure-based virtual screening, and molecular property prediction.</description>

      <title>Causally Reliable Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept-based models are an emerging paradigm in deep learning that constrains the inference process to operate through human-interpretable concepts, facilitating explainability and human interaction. However, these architectures, on par with popular opaque neural models, fail to account for the true causal mechanisms underlying the target phenomena represented in the data. This hampers their ability to support causal reasoning tasks, limits out-of-distribution generalization, and hinders the implementation of fairness constraints. To overcome these issues, we propose \emph{Causally reliable Concept Bottleneck Models} (C$^2$BMs), a class of concept-based architectures that enforce reasoning through a bottleneck of concepts structured according to a model of the real-world causal mechanisms. We also introduce a pipeline to automatically learn this structure from observational data and \emph{unstructured} background knowledge (e.g., scientific literature). Experimental evidence suggest that C$^2$BM are more interpretable, causally reliable, and improve responsiveness to interventions w.r.t. standard opaque and concept-based models, while maintaining their accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dedicated Feedback and Edit Models Empower Inference-Time Scaling for Open-Ended General-Domain Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling has been critical to the success of recent models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1. However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect data for and train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3.</description>

      <title>Speculative MoE: Communication Efficient Parallel MoE Inference with Speculative Token and Expert Pre-scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MoE (Mixture of Experts) prevails as a neural architecture that can scale modern transformer-based LLMs (Large Language Models) to unprecedented scales. Nevertheless, large MoEs' great demands of computing power, memory capacity and memory bandwidth make scalable serving a fundamental challenge and efficient parallel inference has become a requisite to attain adequate throughput under latency constraints. DeepSpeed-MoE, one state-of-the-art MoE inference framework, adopts a 3D-parallel paradigm including EP (Expert Parallelism), TP (Tensor Parallel) and DP (Data Parallelism). However, our analysis shows DeepSpeed-MoE's inference efficiency is largely bottlenecked by EP, which is implemented with costly all-to-all collectives to route token activation. Our work aims to boost DeepSpeed-MoE by strategically reducing EP's communication overhead with a technique named Speculative MoE. Speculative MoE has two speculative parallelization schemes, speculative token shuffling and speculative expert grouping, which predict outstanding tokens' expert routing paths and pre-schedule tokens and experts across devices to losslessly trim EP's communication volume. Besides DeepSpeed-MoE, we also build Speculative MoE into a prevailing MoE inference engine SGLang. Experiments show Speculative MoE can significantly boost state-of-the-art MoE inference frameworks on fast homogeneous and slow heterogeneous interconnects.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Graph Filtering via Multimodal Feature Refinement for Extremely Fast Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems improve the performance of canonical recommender systems with no item features by utilizing diverse content types such as text, images, and videos, while alleviating inherent sparsity of user-item interactions and accelerating user engagement. However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To overcome this limitation, we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method based on the notion of graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs through nontrivial multimodal feature refinement such as robust scaling and vector shifting by addressing the heterogeneous characteristics across modalities. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses multimodal information using linear low-pass filters across different modalities. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 13.35% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</description>

      <title>Learning Transformer-based World Models with Contrastive Predictive Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DreamerV3 algorithm recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by learning an accurate world model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Following the success of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms and the rapid adoption of the Transformer architecture for its superior training efficiency and favorable scaling properties, recent works such as STORM have proposed replacing RNN-based world models with Transformer-based world models using masked self-attention. However, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their impact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm, struggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work, we show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches is insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of Transformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time horizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE Representations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive Coding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the agent performance. TWISTER achieves a human-normalized mean score of 162% on the Atari 100k benchmark, setting a new record among state-of-the-art methods that do not employ look-ahead search.</description>

      <title>PDX: A Data Layout for Vector Similarity Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Partition Dimensions Across (PDX), a data layout for vectors (e.g., embeddings) that, similar to PAX [6], stores multiple vectors in one block, using a vertical layout for the dimensions (Figure 1). PDX accelerates exact and approximate similarity search thanks to its dimension-by-dimension search strategy that operates on multiple-vectors-at-a-time in tight loops. It beats SIMD-optimized distance kernels on standard horizontal vector storage (avg 40% faster), only relying on scalar code that gets auto-vectorized. We combined the PDX layout with recent dimension-pruning algorithms ADSampling [19] and BSA [52] that accelerate approximate vector search. We found that these algorithms on the horizontal vector layout can lose to SIMD-optimized linear scans, even if they are SIMD-optimized. However, when used on PDX, their benefit is restored to 2-7x. We find that search on PDX is especially fast if a limited number of dimensions has to be scanned fully, which is what the dimension-pruning approaches do. We finally introduce PDX-BOND, an even more flexible dimension-pruning strategy, with good performance on exact search and reasonable performance on approximate search. Unlike previous pruning algorithms, it can work on vector data "as-is" without preprocessing; making it attractive for vector databases with frequent updates.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preserving and Robust Aggregation for Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Non-IID Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Averaging remains the most widely used aggregation strategy in federated learning due to its simplicity and scalability. However, its performance degrades significantly in non-IID data settings, where client distributions are highly imbalanced or skewed. Additionally, it relies on clients transmitting metadata, specifically the number of training samples, which introduces privacy risks and may conflict with regulatory frameworks like the European GDPR. In this paper, we propose a novel aggregation strategy that addresses these challenges by introducing class-aware gradient masking. Unlike traditional approaches, our method relies solely on gradient updates, eliminating the need for any additional client metadata, thereby enhancing privacy protection. Furthermore, our approach validates and dynamically weights client contributions based on class-specific importance, ensuring robustness against non-IID distributions, convergence prevention, and backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only outperforms FedAvg and other widely accepted aggregation strategies in non-IID settings but also preserves model integrity in adversarial scenarios. Our results establish the effectiveness of gradient masking as a practical and secure solution for federated learning.</description>

      <title>TPC: Cross-Temporal Prediction Connection for Vision-Language Model Hallucination Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, capitalizing on the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks. Despite this, a critical challenge known as hallucination occurs when models overconfidently describe objects or attributes absent from the image, a problem exacerbated by the tendency of VLMs to rely on linguistic priors. This limitation reduces model reliability in high-stakes applications. In this work, we have observed the characteristic of logits' continuity consistency enhancement and introduced a straightforward and efficient method, Cross-Temporal Prediction Connection (TPC), designed to enhance the semantic consistency of logits by connecting them temporally across timesteps.

      <title>DAST: Difficulty-Adaptive Slow-Thinking for Large Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in slow-thinking reasoning models have shown exceptional performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, these models often exhibit overthinking-generating redundant reasoning steps for simple problems, leading to excessive computational resource usage. While current mitigation strategies uniformly reduce reasoning tokens, they risk degrading performance on challenging tasks that require extended reasoning. This paper introduces Difficulty-Adaptive Slow-Thinking (DAST), a novel framework that enables models to autonomously adjust the length of Chain-of-Thought(CoT) based on problem difficulty. We first propose a Token Length Budget (TLB) metric to quantify difficulty, then leveraging length-aware reward shaping and length preference optimization to implement DAST. DAST penalizes overlong responses for simple tasks while incentivizing sufficient reasoning for complex problems. Experiments on diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that DAST effectively mitigates overthinking (reducing token usage by over 30\% on average) while preserving reasoning accuracy on complex problems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Interpolating Discrete Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models achieve impressive results through next-token prediction, they have inherent limitations such as the inability to revise already generated tokens. This has prompted exploration of alternative approaches such as discrete diffusion. However, masked diffusion, which has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness, reintroduces this inability to revise words. To overcome this, we generalize masked diffusion and derive the theoretical backbone of a family of general interpolating discrete diffusion (GIDD) processes offering greater flexibility in the design of the noising processes. Leveraging a novel diffusion ELBO, we achieve compute-matched state-of-the-art performance in diffusion language modeling. Exploiting GIDD's flexibility, we explore a hybrid approach combining masking and uniform noise, leading to improved sample quality and unlocking the ability for the model to correct its own mistakes, an area where autoregressive models notoriously have struggled. Our code and models are open-source: https://github.com/dvruette/gidd/</description>

      <title>ReynoldsFlow: Exquisite Flow Estimation via Reynolds Transport Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical flow is a fundamental technique for motion estimation, widely applied in video stabilization, interpolation, and object tracking. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled deep learning models to leverage optical flow as an important feature for motion analysis. However, traditional optical flow methods rely on restrictive assumptions, such as brightness constancy and slow motion constraints, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenes. Deep learning-based approaches require extensive training on large domain-specific datasets, making them computationally demanding. Furthermore, optical flow is typically visualized in the HSV color space, which introduces nonlinear distortions when converted to RGB and is highly sensitive to noise, degrading motion representation accuracy. These limitations inherently constrain the performance of downstream models, potentially hindering object tracking and motion analysis tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Reynolds flow, a novel training-free flow estimation inspired by the Reynolds transport theorem, offering a principled approach to modeling complex motion dynamics. Beyond the conventional HSV-based visualization, denoted ReynoldsFlow, we introduce an alternative representation, ReynoldsFlow+, designed to improve flow visualization. We evaluate ReynoldsFlow and ReynoldsFlow+ across three video-based benchmarks: tiny object detection on UAVDB, infrared object detection on Anti-UAV, and pose estimation on GolfDB. Experimental results demonstrate that networks trained with ReynoldsFlow+ achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, exhibiting improved robustness and efficiency across all tasks.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Transformation and Analysis of Timelines through Learning via Surprisability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of high-dimensional timeline data and the identification of outliers and anomalies is critical across diverse domains, including sensor readings, biological and medical data, historical records, and global statistics. However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with challenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity. These limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features, outliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability -- a cognitive science concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected deviations - we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for transforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes anomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from expected behavior. LvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods, enabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical context, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time series of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple years, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of State of the Union Addresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that the LvS transformation enables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and the most variable features along the timeline.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Summarization in Model-Based Engineering: Automotive Software Development Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal summarization integrating information from diverse data modalities presents a promising solution to aid the understanding of information within various processes. However, the application and advantages of multimodal summarization have not received much attention in model-based engineering (MBE), where it has become a cornerstone in the design and development of complex systems, leveraging formal models to improve understanding, validation and automation throughout the engineering lifecycle. UML and EMF diagrams in model-based engineering contain a large amount of multimodal information and intricate relational data. Hence, our study explores the application of multimodal large language models within the domain of model-based engineering to evaluate their capacity for understanding and identifying relationships, features, and functionalities embedded in UML and EMF diagrams. We aim to demonstrate the transformative potential benefits and limitations of multimodal summarization in improving productivity and accuracy in MBE practices. The proposed approach is evaluated within the context of automotive software development, while many promising state-of-art models were taken into account.</description>

      <title>STX-Search: Explanation Search for Continuous Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent improvements in the expressive power of spatio-temporal models have led to performance gains in many real-world applications, such as traffic forecasting and social network modelling. However, understanding the predictions from a model is crucial to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, particularly for high-risk applications, such as healthcare and transport. Few existing methods are able to generate explanations for models trained on continuous-time dynamic graph data and, of these, the computational complexity and lack of suitable explanation objectives pose challenges. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{S}$patio-$\textbf{T}$emporal E$\textbf{X}$planation $\textbf{Search}$ (STX-Search), a novel method for generating instance-level explanations that is applicable to static and dynamic temporal graph structures. We introduce a novel search strategy and objective function, to find explanations that are highly faithful and interpretable. When compared with existing methods, STX-Search produces explanations of higher fidelity whilst optimising explanation size to maintain interpretability.</description>

      <title>Keeping Yourself is Important in Downstream Tuning Multimodal Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) integrate visual and linguistic reasoning to address complex tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. While MLLMs demonstrate remarkable versatility, MLLMs appears limited performance on special applications. But tuning MLLMs for downstream tasks encounters two key challenges: Task-Expert Specialization, where distribution shifts between pre-training and target datasets constrain target performance, and Open-World Stabilization, where catastrophic forgetting erases the model general knowledge. In this work, we systematically review recent advancements in MLLM tuning methodologies, classifying them into three paradigms: (I) Selective Tuning, (II) Additive Tuning, and (III) Reparameterization Tuning. Furthermore, we benchmark these tuning strategies across popular MLLM architectures and diverse downstream tasks to establish standardized evaluation analysis and systematic tuning principles. Finally, we highlight several open challenges in this domain and propose future research directions. To facilitate ongoing progress in this rapidly evolving field, we provide a public repository that continuously tracks developments: https://github.com/WenkeHuang/Awesome-MLLM-Tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal reasoning and compositional reasoning are two core aspirations in generative AI. Measuring the extent of these behaviors requires principled evaluation methods. We explore a unified perspective that considers both behaviors simultaneously, termed compositional causal reasoning (CCR): the ability to infer how causal measures compose and, equivalently, how causal quantities propagate through graphs. We instantiate a framework for the systematic evaluation of CCR for the average treatment effect and the probability of necessity and sufficiency. As proof of concept, we demonstrate the design of CCR tasks for language models in the LLama, Phi, and GPT families. On a math word problem, our framework revealed a range of taxonomically distinct error patterns. Additionally, CCR errors increased with the complexity of causal paths for all models except o1.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Hierarchical Secure Aggregation with Cyclic User Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secure aggregation is motivated by federated learning (FL) where a cloud server aims to compute an averaged model (i.e., weights of deep neural networks) of the locally-trained models of numerous clients, while adhering to data security requirements. Hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) extends this concept to a three-layer network, where clustered users communicate with the server through an intermediate layer of relays. In HSA, beyond conventional server security, relay security is also enforced to ensure that the relays remain oblivious to the users' inputs (an abstraction of the local models in FL). Existing study on HSA assumes that each user is associated with only one relay, limiting opportunities for coding across inter-cluster users to achieve efficient communication and key generation. In this paper, we consider HSA with a cyclic association pattern where each user is connected to $B$ consecutive relays in a wrap-around manner. We propose an efficient aggregation scheme which includes a message design for the inputs inspired by gradient coding-a well-known technique for efficient communication in distributed computing-along with a highly nontrivial security key design. We also derive novel converse bounds on the minimum achievable communication and key rates using information-theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>The Next Frontier of LLM Applications: Open Ecosystems and Hardware Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) applications, including LLM app stores and autonomous agents, are shaping the future of AI ecosystems. However, platform silos, fragmented hardware integration, and the absence of standardized interfaces limit scalability, interoperability, and resource efficiency. While LLM app stores democratize AI, their closed ecosystems restrict modular AI reuse and cross-platform portability. Meanwhile, agent-based frameworks offer flexibility but often lack seamless integration across diverse environments. This paper envisions the future of LLM applications and proposes a three-layer decoupled architecture grounded in software engineering principles such as layered system design, service-oriented architectures, and hardware-software co-design. This architecture separates application logic, communication protocols, and hardware execution, enhancing modularity, efficiency, and cross-platform compatibility. Beyond architecture, we highlight key security and privacy challenges for safe, scalable AI deployment and outline research directions in software and security engineering. This vision aims to foster open, secure, and interoperable LLM ecosystems, guiding future advancements in AI applications.</description>

      <title>HybridNorm: Towards Stable and Efficient Transformer Training via Hybrid Normalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs). Despite their remarkable performance, challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the location of layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate easier training due to their more prominent identity path, they often yield suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{HybridNorm}$, a straightforward yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. This design not only stabilizes training but also enhances performance, particularly in the context of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments in both dense and sparse architectures show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models. %Code will be made publicly available.

      <title>The Best of Both Worlds: Integrating Language Models and Diffusion Models for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models. However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a $\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Keling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field. Our demo can be viewed at https://landiff.github.io/.</description>

      <title>IDInit: A Universal and Stable Initialization Method for Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable accomplishments in practice. The success of these networks hinges on effective initialization methods, which are vital for ensuring stable and rapid convergence during training. Recently, initialization methods that maintain identity transition within layers have shown good efficiency in network training. These techniques (e.g., Fixup) set specific weights to zero to achieve identity control. However, settings of remaining weight (e.g., Fixup uses random values to initialize non-zero weights) will affect the inductive bias that is achieved only by a zero weight, which may be harmful to training. Addressing this concern, we introduce fully identical initialization (IDInit), a novel method that preserves identity in both the main and sub-stem layers of residual networks. IDInit employs a padded identity-like matrix to overcome rank constraints in non-square weight matrices. Furthermore, we show the convergence problem of an identity matrix can be solved by stochastic gradient descent. Additionally, we enhance the universality of IDInit by processing higher-order weights and addressing dead neuron problems. IDInit is a straightforward yet effective initialization method, with improved convergence, stability, and performance across various settings, including large-scale datasets and deep models.</description>

      <title>Mark Your LLM: Detecting the Misuse of Open-Source Large Language Models via Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As open-source large language models (LLMs) like Llama3 become more capable, it is crucial to develop watermarking techniques to detect their potential misuse. Existing watermarking methods either add watermarks during LLM inference, which is unsuitable for open-source LLMs, or primarily target classification LLMs rather than recent generative LLMs. Adapting these watermarks to open-source LLMs for misuse detection remains an open challenge. This work defines two misuse scenarios for open-source LLMs: intellectual property (IP) violation and LLM Usage Violation. Then, we explore the application of inference-time watermark distillation and backdoor watermarking in these contexts. We propose comprehensive evaluation methods to assess the impact of various real-world further fine-tuning scenarios on watermarks and the effect of these watermarks on LLM performance. Our experiments reveal that backdoor watermarking could effectively detect IP Violation, while inference-time watermark distillation is applicable in both scenarios but less robust to further fine-tuning and has a more significant impact on LLM performance compared to backdoor watermarking. Exploring more advanced watermarking methods for open-source LLMs to detect their misuse should be an important future direction.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Real World: A Unified Survey of Multimodal Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Implicit Cross-Lingual Rewarding for Efficient Multilingual Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a prominent method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While DPO has enabled significant progress in aligning English LLMs, multilingual preference alignment is hampered by data scarcity. To address this, we propose a novel approach that $\textit{captures}$ learned preferences from well-aligned English models by implicit rewards and $\textit{transfers}$ them to other languages through iterative training. Specifically, we derive an implicit reward model from the logits of an English DPO-aligned model and its corresponding reference model. This reward model is then leveraged to annotate preference relations in cross-lingual instruction-following pairs, using English instructions to evaluate multilingual responses. The annotated data is subsequently used for multilingual DPO fine-tuning, facilitating preference knowledge transfer from English to other languages. Fine-tuning Llama3 for two iterations resulted in a 12.72% average improvement in Win Rate and a 5.97% increase in Length Control Win Rate across all training languages on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging existing English-aligned models can enable efficient and effective multilingual preference alignment, significantly reducing the need for extensive multilingual preference data.

      <title>Multi-Agent Inverse Q-Learning from Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When reward functions are hand-designed, deep reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from reward misspecification, causing them to learn suboptimal policies in terms of the intended task objectives. In the single-agent case, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques attempt to address this issue by inferring the reward function from expert demonstrations. However, in multi-agent problems, misalignment between the learned and true objectives is exacerbated due to increased environment non-stationarity and variance that scales with multiple agents. As such, in multi-agent general-sum games, multi-agent IRL algorithms have difficulty balancing cooperative and competitive objectives. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Agent Marginal Q-Learning from Demonstrations (MAMQL), a novel sample-efficient framework for multi-agent IRL. For each agent, MAMQL learns a critic marginalized over the other agents' policies, allowing for a well-motivated use of Boltzmann policies in the multi-agent context. We identify a connection between optimal marginalized critics and single-agent soft-Q IRL, allowing us to apply a direct, simple optimization criterion from the single-agent domain. Across our experiments on three different simulated domains, MAMQL significantly outperforms previous multi-agent methods in average reward, sample efficiency, and reward recovery by often more than 2-5x.

      <title>Matrix Factorization for Inferring Associations and Missing Links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing link prediction is a method for network analysis, with applications in recommender systems, biology, social sciences, cybersecurity, information retrieval, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) reasoning in Knowledge Graphs. Missing link prediction identifies unseen but potentially existing connections in a network by analyzing the observed patterns and relationships. In proliferation detection, this supports efforts to identify and characterize attempts by state and non-state actors to acquire nuclear weapons or associated technology - a notoriously challenging but vital mission for global security. Dimensionality reduction techniques like Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Logistic Matrix Factorization (LMF) are effective but require selection of the matrix rank parameter, that is, of the number of hidden features, k, to avoid over/under-fitting. We introduce novel Weighted (WNMFk), Boolean (BNMFk), and Recommender (RNMFk) matrix factorization methods, along with ensemble variants incorporating logistic factorization, for link prediction. Our methods integrate automatic model determination for rank estimation by evaluating stability and accuracy using a modified bootstrap methodology and uncertainty quantification (UQ), assessing prediction reliability under random perturbations. We incorporate Otsu threshold selection and k-means clustering for Boolean matrix factorization, comparing them to coordinate descent-based Boolean thresholding. Our experiments highlight the impact of rank k selection, evaluate model performance under varying test-set sizes, and demonstrate the benefits of UQ for reliable predictions using abstention. We validate our methods on three synthetic datasets (Boolean and uniformly distributed) and benchmark them against LMF and symmetric LMF (symLMF) on five real-world protein-protein interaction networks, showcasing an improved prediction performance.</description>

      <title>L1: Controlling How Long A Reasoning Model Thinks With Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning language models have shown an uncanny ability to improve performance at test-time by ``thinking longer''-that is, by generating longer chain-of-thought sequences and hence using more compute. However, the length of their chain-of-thought reasoning is not controllable, making it impossible to allocate test-time compute to achieve a desired level of performance. We introduce Length Controlled Policy Optimization (LCPO), a simple reinforcement learning method that optimizes for accuracy and adherence to user-specified length constraints. We use LCPO to train L1, a reasoning language model that produces outputs satisfying a length constraint given in its prompt. L1's length control allows for smoothly trading off computational cost and accuracy on a wide range of tasks, and outperforms the state-of-the-art S1 method for length control. Furthermore, we uncover an unexpected short chain-of-thought capability in models trained with LCPO. For instance, our 1.5B L1 model surpasses GPT-4o at equal reasoning lengths. Overall, LCPO enables precise control over reasoning length, allowing for fine-grained allocation of test-time compute and accuracy.

      <title>Universality of Layer-Level Entropy-Weighted Quantization Beyond Model Architecture and Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to selective model quantization that transcends the limitations of architecture-specific and size-dependent compression methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) using Entropy-Weighted Quantization (EWQ). By analyzing the entropy distribution across transformer blocks, EWQ determines which blocks can be safely quantized without causing significant performance degradation, independent of model architecture or size. Our method outperforms uniform quantization approaches, maintaining Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) accuracy scores within 0.5% of unquantized models while reducing memory usage by up to 18%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EWQ across multiple architectures-from 1.6B to 70B parameters-showcasing consistent improvements in the quality-compression trade-off regardless of model scale or architectural design. A surprising finding of EWQ is its ability to reduce perplexity compared to unquantized models, suggesting the presence of beneficial regularization through selective precision reduction. This improvement holds across different model families, indicating a fundamental relationship between layer-level entropy and optimal precision requirements. Additionally, we introduce FastEWQ, a rapid method for entropy distribution analysis that eliminates the need for loading model weights. This technique leverages universal characteristics of entropy distribution that persist across various architectures and scales, enabling near-instantaneous quantization decisions while maintaining 80% classification accuracy with full entropy analysis. Our results demonstrate that effective quantization strategies can be developed independently of specific architectural choices or model sizes, opening new possibilities for efficient LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Models for Phoneme Recognition: Applications in Children's Speech for Reading Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Child speech recognition is still an underdeveloped area of research due to the lack of data (especially on non-English languages) and the specific difficulties of this task. Having explored various architectures for child speech recognition in previous work, in this article we tackle recent self-supervised models. We first compare wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT and WavLM models adapted to phoneme recognition in French child speech, and continue our experiments with the best of them, WavLM base+. We then further adapt it by unfreezing its transformer blocks during fine-tuning on child speech, which greatly improves its performance and makes it significantly outperform our base model, a Transformer+CTC. Finally, we study in detail the behaviour of these two models under the real conditions of our application, and show that WavLM base+ is more robust to various reading tasks and noise levels.

      <title>Scaling Rich Style-Prompted Text-to-Speech Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Paralinguistic Speech Captions (ParaSpeechCaps), a large-scale dataset that annotates speech utterances with rich style captions. While rich abstract tags (e.g. guttural, nasal, pained) have been explored in small-scale human-annotated datasets, existing large-scale datasets only cover basic tags (e.g. low-pitched, slow, loud). We combine off-the-shelf text and speech embedders, classifiers and an audio language model to automatically scale rich tag annotations for the first time. ParaSpeechCaps covers a total of 59 style tags, including both speaker-level intrinsic tags and utterance-level situational tags. It consists of 342 hours of human-labelled data (PSC-Base) and 2427 hours of automatically annotated data (PSC-Scaled). We finetune Parler-TTS, an open-source style-prompted TTS model, on ParaSpeechCaps, and achieve improved style consistency (+7.9% Consistency MOS) and speech quality (+15.5% Naturalness MOS) over the best performing baseline that combines existing rich style tag datasets. We ablate several of our dataset design choices to lay the foundation for future work in this space. Our dataset, models and code are released at https://github.com/ajd12342/paraspeechcaps .</description>

      <title>Predictable Scale: Part I -- Optimal Hyperparameter Scaling Law in Large Language Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates careful hyperparameter optimization. Through extensive empirical studies involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal batch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size conditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the community. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.07\% away from the globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training data distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter scaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and hyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in total. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will progressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our designated repository https://step-law.github.io/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit the ability to generalize given few-shot examples in their input prompt, an emergent capability known as in-context learning (ICL). We investigate whether LLMs utilize ICL to perform structured reasoning in ways that are consistent with a Bayesian framework or rely on pattern matching. Using a controlled setting of biased coin flips, we find that: (1) LLMs often possess biased priors, causing initial divergence in zero-shot settings, (2) in-context evidence outweighs explicit bias instructions, (3) LLMs broadly follow Bayesian posterior updates, with deviations primarily due to miscalibrated priors rather than flawed updates, and (4) attention magnitude has negligible effect on Bayesian inference. With sufficient demonstrations of biased coin flips via ICL, LLMs update their priors in a Bayesian manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) have primarily concentrated on processing extended input contexts, resulting in significant strides in long-context comprehension. However, the equally critical aspect of generating long-form outputs has received comparatively less attention. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift in NLP research toward addressing the challenges of long-output generation. Tasks such as novel writing, long-term planning, and complex reasoning require models to understand extensive contexts and produce coherent, contextually rich, and logically consistent extended text. These demands highlight a critical gap in current LLM capabilities. We underscore the importance of this under-explored domain and call for focused efforts to develop foundational LLMs tailored for generating high-quality, long-form outputs, which hold immense potential for real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: We rigorously establish a bipartite mutual information scaling law in natural language that governs long-range dependencies. This scaling law, which we show is distinct from and scales independently of the conventional two-point mutual information, is the key to understanding long-context language modeling. Using this scaling law, we formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L$^2$M) condition, which relates a model's capacity for effective long context length modeling to the scaling of its latent state size for storing past information. Our results are validated through experiments on both transformers and state space models. This work establishes a theoretical foundation that guides the development of large language models toward longer context lengths.</description>

      <title>360$^\circ$REA: Towards A Reusable Experience Accumulation with 360{\deg} Assessment for Multi-Agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model agents have demonstrated remarkable advancements across various complex tasks. Recent works focus on optimizing the agent team or employing self-reflection to iteratively solve complex tasks. Since these agents are all based on the same LLM, only conducting self-evaluation or removing underperforming agents does not substantively enhance the capability of the agents. We argue that a comprehensive evaluation and accumulating experience from evaluation feedback is an effective approach to improving system performance. In this paper, we propose Reusable Experience Accumulation with 360$^\circ$ Assessment (360$^\circ$REA), a hierarchical multi-agent framework inspired by corporate organizational practices. The framework employs a novel 360$^\circ$ performance assessment method for multi-perspective performance evaluation with fine-grained assessment. To enhance the capability of agents in addressing complex tasks, we introduce dual-level experience pool for agents to accumulate experience through fine-grained assessment. Extensive experiments on complex task datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of 360$^\circ$REA.</description>

      <title>Unraveling and Mitigating Retriever Inconsistencies in Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20680v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RALMs) demonstrate their superiority in terms of factuality, they do not consistently outperform the original retrieval-free Language Models (LMs). Our experiments reveal that this example-level performance inconsistency exists not only between retrieval-augmented and retrieval-free LM but also among different retrievers. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate the degeneration behavior of RALMs and theoretically decompose it into four categories. Further analysis based on our decomposition reveals that the innate difference in knowledge sources and the unpredictable degeneration of the reader model contribute most to the inconsistency. Drawing from our analysis, we introduce Ensemble of Retrievers (EoR), a trainable framework that can adaptively retrieve from different knowledge sources and effectively decrease unpredictable reader errors. Our experiments on Open Domain Question Answering show that EoR substantially improves performance over the RALM with a single retriever by considerably reducing inconsistent behaviors.</description>

      <title>Automatically Labeling Clinical Trial Outcomes: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Drug Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background The cost of drug discovery and development is substantial, with clinical trial outcomes playing a critical role in regulatory approval and patient care. However, access to large-scale, high-quality clinical trial outcome data remains limited, hindering advancements in predictive modeling and evidence-based decision-making.
  Methods We present the Clinical Trial Outcome (CTO) benchmark, a fully reproducible, large-scale repository encompassing approximately 125,000 drug and biologics trials. CTO integrates large language model (LLM) interpretations of publications, trial phase progression tracking, sentiment analysis from news sources, stock price movements of trial sponsors, and additional trial-related metrics. Furthermore, we manually annotated a dataset of clinical trials conducted between 2020 and 2024 to enhance the quality and reliability of outcome labels.
  Results The trial outcome labels in the CTO benchmark agree strongly with expert annotations, achieving an F1 score of 94 for Phase 3 trials and 91 across all phases. Additionally, benchmarking standard machine learning models on our manually annotated dataset revealed distribution shifts in recent trials, underscoring the necessity of continuously updated labeling approaches.
  Conclusions By analyzing CTO's performance on recent clinical trials, we demonstrate the ongoing need for high-quality, up-to-date trial outcome labels. We publicly release the CTO knowledge base and annotated labels at https://chufangao.github.io/CTOD, with regular updates to support research on clinical trial outcomes and inform data-driven improvements in drug development.</description>

      <title>SMAC-R1: The Emergence of Intelligence in Decision-Making Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) has been one of the most commonly used experimental environments in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the specific task is to control a set number of allied units to defeat enemy forces. Traditional MARL algorithms often require interacting with the environment for millions of steps to train a parametric model, of which the resulting policies are typically non-interpretable with weak transferability. In this paper, we introduce SMAC-R1 which is based on the Qwen2.5-7B-Base LLM distilled from DeepSeek-Coder-v2.5-236B. Similar to online reinforcement learning after behavior cloning in offline learning process, in our pipeline, agents leverage the DeepSeek LLM to generate decision tree code by providing task descriptions, and the agents are further self-reflected using feedback from the rewards provided by the environment. Based on that, we augment the generated scripts to fine-tune a small LLM, Qwen2.5-7B-Base, to distill the decision-making ability via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and enhance the script generation ability by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. We conduct experiments in the original 23 SMAC tasks and 10 newly-designed tasks to demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality, interpretable decision trees with minimal environmental exploration. Moreover, these scripts exhibit strong transferability, successfully applying to homogeneous SMAC environments without modification. We believe this approach offers a new direction for solving decision-making tasks and domain-specific LLM training pipelines in the future.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain of Thought for Efficient Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) of multi-step benefits from the logical structure of the reasoning steps and task-specific actions, significantly enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. As the prevalence of long CoT, the number of reasoning steps exceeds manageable token limits and leads to higher computational demands. Inspired by the fundamental logic of human cognition, "derive, then reduce", we conceptualize the standard multi-step CoT as a novel Markov Chain of Thought (MCoT). In this study, we consider the mathematical reasoning task, defining each reasoning step as text accompanied by a Python code snippet. To facilitate a longer reasoning path, self-correction is enabled through interactions with the code interpreter. Our MCoT aims to compress previous reasoning steps into a simplified question, enabling efficient next-step inference without relying on a lengthy KV cache. In our experiments, we curate the $\texttt{MCoTInstruct}$ dataset, and the empirical results indicate that MCoT not only significantly enhances efficiency but also maintains comparable accuracy. While much remains to be explored, this work paves the way for exploring the long CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/james-yw/Markov-Chain-of-Thought</description>

      <title>Watson: A Cognitive Observability Framework for the Reasoning of LLM-Powered Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As foundation models (FMs) play an increasingly prominent role in complex software systems, such as agentic software, they introduce significant observability and debuggability challenges. Although recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate their thought processes as part of the output, in many scenarios fast-thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) are still preferred due to latency constraints. LLM-powered agents operate autonomously with opaque implicit reasoning, making it difficult to debug their unexpected behaviors or errors. In this paper, we introduce Watson, a novel framework that provides reasoning observability into the implicit reasoning processes of agents driven by fast-thinking LLMs, allowing the identification and localization of errors and guidance for corrections. We demonstrate the accuracy of the recovered implicit reasoning trace by Watson and its usefulness through debugging and improving the performance of LLM-powered agents in two scenarios: Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark and SWE-bench-lite. Using Watson, we were able to observe and identify the implicit reasoning errors, and automatically provide targeted corrections at runtime that improve the Pass@1 of agents on MMLU and SWE-bench-lite by 7.58 (13.45% relative improvement) and 7.76 (12.31% relative improvement) percentage points, respectively, without updates to models or the cognitive architecture of the agents.</description>

      <title>Human Motion Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents LLaMo (Large Language and Human Motion Assistant), a multimodal framework for human motion instruction tuning. In contrast to conventional instruction-tuning approaches that convert non-linguistic inputs, such as video or motion sequences, into language tokens, LLaMo retains motion in its native form for instruction tuning. This method preserves motion-specific details that are often diminished in tokenization, thereby improving the model's ability to interpret complex human behaviors. By processing both video and motion data alongside textual inputs, LLaMo enables a flexible, human-centric analysis. Experimental evaluations across high-complexity domains, including human behaviors and professional activities, indicate that LLaMo effectively captures domain-specific knowledge, enhancing comprehension and prediction in motion-intensive scenarios. We hope LLaMo offers a foundation for future multimodal AI systems with broad applications, from sports analytics to behavioral prediction. Our code and models are available on the project website: https://github.com/ILGLJ/LLaMo.</description>

      <title>A Survey on LLM Test-Time Compute via Search: Tasks, LLM Profiling, Search Algorithms, and Relevant Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM test-time compute (or LLM inference) via search has emerged as a promising research area with rapid developments. However, current frameworks often adopt distinct perspectives on three key aspects (task definition, LLM profiling, and search procedures), making direct comparisons challenging. Moreover, the search algorithms employed often diverge from standard implementations, and their specific characteristics are not thoroughly specified. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive technical review that unifies task definitions and provides modular definitions of LLM profiling and search procedures. The definitions enable precise comparisons of various LLM inference frameworks while highlighting their departures from conventional search algorithms. We also discuss the applicability, performance, and efficiency of these methods. We have updated our content to include the latest papers, and the differences between versions are highlighted in the appendix. For further details and ongoing updates, please refer to our GitHub repository: https://github.com/xinzhel/LLM-Agent-Survey/blob/main/search.md</description>

      <title>Nature Language Model: Deciphering the Language of Nature for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing and artificial intelligence, significantly enhancing how machines comprehend and generate human languages. Inspired by the success of these foundation models, researchers have developed foundation models for individual scientific domains, including small molecules, materials, proteins, DNA, RNA and even cells. However, these models are typically trained in isolation, lacking the ability to integrate across different scientific domains. Recognizing that entities within these domains can all be represented as sequences, which together form the "language of nature", we introduce Nature Language Model (NatureLM), a sequence-based science foundation model designed for scientific discovery. Pre-trained with data from multiple scientific domains, NatureLM offers a unified, versatile model that enables various applications including: (i) generating and optimizing small molecules, proteins, RNA, and materials using text instructions; (ii) cross-domain generation/design, such as protein-to-molecule and protein-to-RNA generation; and (iii) top performance across different domains, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art specialist models. NatureLM offers a promising generalist approach for various scientific tasks, including drug discovery (hit generation/optimization, ADMET optimization, synthesis), novel material design, and the development of therapeutic proteins or nucleotides. We have developed NatureLM models in different sizes (1 billion, 8 billion, and 46.7 billion parameters) and observed a clear improvement in performance as the model size increases.</description>

      <title>SycEval: Evaluating LLM Sycophancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in educational, clinical, and professional settings, but their tendency for sycophancy -- prioritizing user agreement over independent reasoning -- poses risks to reliability. This study introduces a framework to evaluate sycophantic behavior in ChatGPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro across AMPS (mathematics) and MedQuad (medical advice) datasets. Sycophantic behavior was observed in 58.19% of cases, with Gemini exhibiting the highest rate (62.47%) and ChatGPT the lowest (56.71%). Progressive sycophancy, leading to correct answers, occurred in 43.52% of cases, while regressive sycophancy, leading to incorrect answers, was observed in 14.66%. Preemptive rebuttals demonstrated significantly higher sycophancy rates than in-context rebuttals (61.75% vs. 56.52%, $Z=5.87$, $p&lt;0.001$), particularly in computational tasks, where regressive sycophancy increased significantly (preemptive: 8.13%, in-context: 3.54%, $p&lt;0.001$). Simple rebuttals maximized progressive sycophancy ($Z=6.59$, $p&lt;0.001$), while citation-based rebuttals exhibited the highest regressive rates ($Z=6.59$, $p&lt;0.001$). Sycophantic behavior showed high persistence (78.5%, 95% CI: [77.2%, 79.8%]) regardless of context or model. These findings emphasize the risks and opportunities of deploying LLMs in structured and dynamic domains, offering insights into prompt programming and model optimization for safer AI applications.</description>

      <title>Investigating Non-Transitivity in LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic evaluation methods based on large language models (LLMs) are emerging as the standard tool for assessing the instruction-following abilities of LLM-based agents. The most common method in this paradigm, pairwise comparisons with a baseline model, critically depends on the assumption of transitive preferences. However, the validity of this assumption remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the presence of non-transitivity within the AlpacaEval framework and analyze its effects on model rankings. We find that LLM judges exhibit non-transitive preferences, leading to rankings that are sensitive to the choice of the baseline model. To mitigate this issue, we show that round-robin tournaments combined with Bradley-Terry models of preference can produce more reliable rankings. Notably, our method increases both the Spearman correlation and the Kendall correlation with Chatbot Arena (95.0% -&gt; 96.4% and 82.1% -&gt; 86.3% respectively). To address the computational cost of round-robin tournaments, we propose Swiss-Wise Iterative Matchmaking (Swim) tournaments, using a dynamic matching strategy to capture the benefits of round-robin tournaments while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Pretrained Embeddings as a Behavior Specification Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach to formally specifying the behavioral properties of systems that rely on a perception model for interactions with the physical world. The key idea is to introduce embeddings -- mathematical representations of a real-world concept -- as a first-class construct in a specification language, where properties are expressed in terms of distances between a pair of ideal and observed embeddings. To realize this approach, we propose a new type of temporal logic called Embedding Temporal Logic (ETL), and describe how it can be used to express a wider range of properties about AI-enabled systems than previously possible. We demonstrate the applicability of ETL through a preliminary evaluation involving planning tasks in robots that are driven by foundation models; the results are promising, showing that embedding-based specifications can be used to steer a system towards desirable behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel question-answering (QA) dataset using echocardiogram reports sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. This dataset is specifically designed to enhance QA systems in cardiology, consisting of 771,244 QA pairs addressing a wide array of cardiac abnormalities and their severity. We compare large language models (LLMs), including open-source and biomedical-specific models for zero-shot evaluation, and closed-source models for zero-shot and three-shot evaluation. Our results show that fine-tuning LLMs improves performance across various QA metrics, validating the value of our dataset. Clinicians also qualitatively evaluate the best-performing model to assess the LLM responses for correctness. Further, we conduct fine-grained fairness audits to assess the bias-performance trade-off of LLMs across various social determinants of health. Our objective is to propel the field forward by establishing a benchmark for LLM AI agents aimed at supporting clinicians with cardiac differential diagnoses, thereby reducing the documentation burden that contributes to clinician burnout and enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care.</description>

      <title>Unified Mind Model: Reimagining Autonomous Agents in the LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities across domains, tasks, and languages (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4), reviving the research of general autonomous agents with human-like cognitive abilities. Such human-level agents require semantic comprehension and instruction-following capabilities, which exactly fall into the strengths of LLMs. Although there have been several initial attempts to build human-level agents based on LLMs, the theoretical foundation remains a challenging open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical cognitive architecture, the Unified Mind Model (UMM), which offers guidance to facilitate the rapid creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities. Specifically, our UMM starts with the global workspace theory and further leverage LLMs to enable the agent with various cognitive abilities, such as multi-modal perception, planning, reasoning, tool use, learning, memory, reflection and motivation. Building upon UMM, we then develop an agent-building engine, MindOS, which allows users to quickly create domain-/task-specific autonomous agents without any programming effort.</description>

      <title>Tutorial on amortized optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00665v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization is a ubiquitous modeling tool and is often deployed in settings which repeatedly solve similar instances of the same problem. Amortized optimization methods use learning to predict the solutions to problems in these settings, exploiting the shared structure between similar problem instances. These methods have been crucial in variational inference and reinforcement learning and are capable of solving optimization problems many orders of magnitudes times faster than traditional optimization methods that do not use amortization. This tutorial presents an introduction to the amortized optimization foundations behind these advancements and overviews their applications in variational inference, sparse coding, gradient-based meta-learning, control, reinforcement learning, convex optimization, optimal transport, and deep equilibrium networks. The source code for this tutorial is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/amortized-optimization-tutorial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mathematical study of voting, social choice theory, has traditionally only been applicable to choices among a few predetermined alternatives, but not to open-ended decisions such as collectively selecting a textual statement. We introduce generative social choice, a design methodology for open-ended democratic processes that combines the rigor of social choice theory with the capability of large language models to generate text and extrapolate preferences. Our framework divides the design of AI-augmented democratic processes into two components: first, proving that the process satisfies representation guarantees when given access to oracle queries; second, empirically validating that these queries can be approximately implemented using a large language model. We apply this framework to the problem of summarizing free-form opinions into a proportionally representative slate of opinion statements; specifically, we develop a democratic process with representation guarantees and use this process to portray the opinions of participants in a survey about abortion policy. In a trial with 100 representative US residents, we find that 84 out of 100 participants feel "excellently" or "exceptionally" represented by the slate of five statements we extracted.</description>

      <title>AfroBench: How Good are Large Language Models on African Languages?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale multilingual evaluations, such as MEGA, often include only a handful of African languages due to the scarcity of high-quality evaluation data and the limited discoverability of existing African datasets. This lack of representation hinders comprehensive LLM evaluation across a diverse range of languages and tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce AfroBench -- a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLMs across 64 African languages, 15 tasks and 22 datasets. AfroBench consists of nine natural language understanding datasets, six text generation datasets, six knowledge and question answering tasks, and one mathematical reasoning task. We present results comparing the performance of prompting LLMs to fine-tuned baselines based on BERT and T5-style models. Our results suggest large gaps in performance between high-resource languages, such as English, and African languages across most tasks; but performance also varies based on the availability of monolingual data resources. Our findings confirm that performance on African languages continues to remain a hurdle for current LLMs, underscoring the need for additional efforts to close this gap.

      <title>Extracting Formulae in Many-Valued Logic from Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new perspective on deep ReLU networks, namely as circuit counterparts of Lukasiewicz infinite-valued logic -- a many-valued (MV) generalization of Boolean logic. An algorithm for extracting formulae in MV logic from deep ReLU networks is presented. As the algorithm applies to networks with general, in particular also real-valued, weights, it can be used to extract logical formulae from deep ReLU networks trained on data.</description>

      <title>Digital Divides in Scene Recognition: Uncovering Socioeconomic Biases in Deep Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer-based scene understanding has influenced fields ranging from urban planning to autonomous vehicle performance, yet little is known about how well these technologies work across social differences. We investigate the biases of deep convolutional neural networks (dCNNs) in scene classification, using nearly one million images from global and US sources, including user-submitted home photographs and Airbnb listings. We applied statistical models to quantify the impact of socioeconomic indicators such as family income, Human Development Index (HDI), and demographic factors from public data sources (CIA and US Census) on dCNN performance. Our analyses revealed significant socioeconomic bias, where pretrained dCNNs demonstrated lower classification accuracy, lower classification confidence, and a higher tendency to assign labels that could be offensive when applied to homes (e.g., "ruin", "slum"), especially in images from homes with lower socioeconomic status (SES). This trend is consistent across two datasets of international images and within the diverse economic and racial landscapes of the United States. This research contributes to understanding biases in computer vision, emphasizing the need for more inclusive and representative training datasets. By mitigating the bias in the computer vision pipelines, we can ensure fairer and more equitable outcomes for applied computer vision, including home valuation and smart home security systems. There is urgency in addressing these biases, which can significantly impact critical decisions in urban development and resource allocation. Our findings also motivate the development of AI systems that better understand and serve diverse communities, moving towards technology that equitably benefits all sectors of society.</description>

      <title>PQMass: Probabilistic Assessment of the Quality of Generative Models using Probability Mass Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a likelihood-free method for comparing two distributions given samples from each, with the goal of assessing the quality of generative models. The proposed approach, PQMass, provides a statistically rigorous method for assessing the performance of a single generative model or the comparison of multiple competing models. PQMass divides the sample space into non-overlapping regions and applies chi-squared tests to the number of data samples that fall within each region, giving a p-value that measures the probability that the bin counts derived from two sets of samples are drawn from the same multinomial distribution. PQMass does not depend on assumptions regarding the density of the true distribution, nor does it rely on training or fitting any auxiliary models. We evaluate PQMass on data of various modalities and dimensions, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing the quality, novelty, and diversity of generated samples. We further show that PQMass scales well to moderately high-dimensional data and thus obviates the need for feature extraction in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Which Frequencies do CNNs Need? Emergent Bottleneck Structure in Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the emergence of a Convolution Bottleneck (CBN) structure in CNNs, where the network uses its first few layers to transform the input representation into a representation that is supported only along a few frequencies and channels, before using the last few layers to map back to the outputs. We define the CBN rank, which describes the number and type of frequencies that are kept inside the bottleneck, and partially prove that the parameter norm required to represent a function $f$ scales as depth times the CBN rank $f$. We also show that the parameter norm depends at next order on the regularity of $f$. We show that any network with almost optimal parameter norm will exhibit a CBN structure in both the weights and - under the assumption that the network is stable under large learning rate - the activations, which motivates the common practice of down-sampling; and we verify that the CBN results still hold with down-sampling. Finally we use the CBN structure to interpret the functions learned by CNNs on a number of tasks.</description>

      <title>GenCeption: Evaluate Vision LLMs with Unlabeled Unimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14973v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are typically assessed using expensive annotated multimodal benchmarks, which often lag behind the rapidly evolving demands of MLLM evaluation. This paper outlines and validates GenCeption, a novel, annotation-free evaluation method that requires only unimodal data to measure inter-modality semantic coherence and inversely assesses MLLMs' tendency to hallucinate. This approach eliminates the need for costly data annotation, minimizes the risk of training data contamination, is expected to result in slower benchmark saturation, and avoids the illusion of emerging abilities. Inspired by the DrawCeption game, GenCeption begins with a non-textual sample and proceeds through iterative description and generation steps. The semantic drift across iterations is quantified using the GC@T metric. While GenCeption is principally applicable to MLLMs across various modalities, this paper focuses on its implementation and validation for Vision LLMs (VLLMs). Based on the GenCeption method, we establish the MMECeption benchmark for evaluating VLLMs, and compare the performance of several popular VLLMs and human annotators. Our empirical results validate GenCeption's effectiveness, demonstrating strong correlations with established VLLM benchmarks. VLLMs still significantly lag behind human performance and struggle especially with text-intensive tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Challenges and Opportunities in Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of deep generative modeling has grown rapidly in the last few years. With the availability of massive amounts of training data coupled with advances in scalable unsupervised learning paradigms, recent large-scale generative models show tremendous promise in synthesizing high-resolution images and text, as well as structured data such as videos and molecules. However, we argue that current large-scale generative AI models exhibit several fundamental shortcomings that hinder their widespread adoption across domains. In this work, our objective is to identify these issues and highlight key unresolved challenges in modern generative AI paradigms that should be addressed to further enhance their capabilities, versatility, and reliability. By identifying these challenges, we aim to provide researchers with insights for exploring fruitful research directions, thus fostering the development of more robust and accessible generative AI solutions.</description>

      <title>Data augmentation with automated machine learning: approaches and performance comparison with classical data augmentation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation is arguably the most important regularization technique commonly used to improve generalization performance of machine learning models. It primarily involves the application of appropriate data transformation operations to create new data samples with desired properties. Despite its effectiveness, the process is often challenging because of the time-consuming trial and error procedures for creating and testing different candidate augmentations and their hyperparameters manually. State-of-the-art approaches are increasingly relying on automated machine learning (AutoML) principles. This work presents a comprehensive survey of AutoML-based data augmentation techniques. We discuss various approaches for accomplishing data augmentation with AutoML, including data manipulation, data integration and data synthesis techniques. The focus of this work is on image data augmentation methods. Nonetheless, we cover other data modalities, especially in cases where the specific data augmentations techniques being discussed are more suitable for these other modalities. For instance, since automated data integration methods are more suitable for tabular data, we cover tabular data in the discussion of data integration methods. The work also presents extensive discussion of techniques for accomplishing each of the major subtasks of the image data augmentation process: search space design, hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation. Finally, we carried out an extensive comparison and analysis of the performance of automated data augmentation techniques and state-of-the-art methods based on classical augmentation approaches. The results show that AutoML methods for data augmentation currently outperform state-of-the-art techniques based on conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Can We Talk Models Into Seeing the World Differently?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike traditional vision-only models, vision language models (VLMs) offer an intuitive way to access visual content through language prompting by combining a large language model (LLM) with a vision encoder. However, both the LLM and the vision encoder come with their own set of biases, cue preferences, and shortcuts, which have been rigorously studied in uni-modal models. A timely question is how such (potentially misaligned) biases and cue preferences behave under multi-modal fusion in VLMs. As a first step towards a better understanding, we investigate a particularly well-studied vision-only bias - the texture vs. shape bias and the dominance of local over global information. As expected, we find that VLMs inherit this bias to some extent from their vision encoders. Surprisingly, the multi-modality alone proves to have important effects on the model behavior, i.e., the joint training and the language querying change the way visual cues are processed. While this direct impact of language-informed training on a model's visual perception is intriguing, it raises further questions on our ability to actively steer a model's output so that its prediction is based on particular visual cues of the user's choice. Interestingly, VLMs have an inherent tendency to recognize objects based on shape information, which is different from what a plain vision encoder would do. Further active steering towards shape-based classifications through language prompts is however limited. In contrast, active VLM steering towards texture-based decisions through simple natural language prompts is often more successful.

      <title>FlexiFly: Interfacing the Physical World with Foundation Models Empowered by Reconfigurable Drone Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have shown immense human-like capabilities for generating digital media. However, foundation models that can freely sense, interact, and actuate the physical domain is far from being realized. This is due to 1) requiring dense deployments of sensors to fully cover and analyze large spaces, while 2) events often being localized to small areas, making it difficult for FMs to pinpoint relevant areas of interest relevant to the current task. We propose FlexiFly, a platform that enables FMs to ``zoom in'' and analyze relevant areas with higher granularity to better understand the physical environment and carry out tasks. FlexiFly accomplishes by introducing 1) a novel image segmentation technique that aids in identifying relevant locations and 2) a modular and reconfigurable sensing and actuation drone platform that FMs can actuate to ``zoom in'' with relevant sensors and actuators. We demonstrate through real smart home deployments that FlexiFly enables FMs and LLMs to complete diverse tasks up to $85\%$ more successfully. FlexiFly is critical step towards FMs and LLMs that can naturally interface with the physical world.</description>

      <title>Your Finetuned Large Language Model is Already a Powerful Out-of-distribution Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the likelihood ratio between a pretrained large language model (LLM) and its finetuned variant as a criterion for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. The intuition behind such a criterion is that, the pretrained LLM has the prior knowledge about OOD data due to its large amount of training data, and once finetuned with the in-distribution data, the LLM has sufficient knowledge to distinguish their difference. Leveraging the power of LLMs, we show that, the likelihood ratio can serve as an effective OOD detection criterion. Moreover, we apply the proposed LLM-based likelihood ratio to detect OOD questions in question-answering (QA) systems, which can be used to improve the performance of specialized LLMs for general questions. Given that likelihood can be easily obtained by the loss functions within contemporary neural network frameworks, it is straightforward to implement this approach in practice. Since both the pretrained LLMs and its various finetuned models are widely available from online platforms such as Hugging Face, our proposed criterion can be effortlessly incorporated for OOD detection without the need for further training. We conduct comprehensive evaluation across on multiple settings, including far OOD, near OOD, spam detection, and QA scenarios, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

      <title>Semi-Parametric Retrieval via Binary Bag-of-Tokens Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information retrieval has transitioned from standalone systems into essential components across broader applications, with indexing efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and freshness becoming increasingly critical yet often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce SemI-parametric Disentangled Retrieval (SiDR), a bi-encoder retrieval framework that decouples retrieval index from neural parameters to enable efficient, low-cost, and parameter-agnostic indexing for emerging use cases. Specifically, in addition to using embeddings as indexes like existing neural retrieval methods, SiDR supports a non-parametric tokenization index for search, achieving BM25-like indexing complexity with significantly better effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across 16 retrieval benchmarks demonstrates that SiDR outperforms both neural and term-based retrieval baselines under the same indexing workload: (i) When using an embedding-based index, SiDR exceeds the performance of conventional neural retrievers while maintaining similar training complexity; (ii) When using a tokenization-based index, SiDR drastically reduces indexing cost and time, matching the complexity of traditional term-based retrieval, while consistently outperforming BM25 on all in-domain datasets; (iii) Additionally, we introduce a late parametric mechanism that matches BM25 index preparation time while outperforming other neural retrieval baselines in effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Autoformalizing Natural Language to First-Order Logic: A Case Study in Logical Fallacy Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating natural language into formal language such as First-Order Logic (FOL) is a foundational challenge in NLP with wide-ranging applications in automated reasoning, misinformation tracking, and knowledge validation. In this paper, we introduce Natural Language to First-Order Logic (NL2FOL), a framework to autoformalize natural language to FOL step by step using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach addresses key challenges in this translation process, including the integration of implicit background knowledge. By leveraging structured representations generated by NL2FOL, we use Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers to reason about the logical validity of natural language statements. We present logical fallacy detection as a case study to evaluate the efficacy of NL2FOL. Being neurosymbolic, our approach also provides interpretable insights into the reasoning process and demonstrates robustness without requiring model fine-tuning or labeled training data. Our framework achieves strong performance on multiple datasets. On the LOGIC dataset, NL2FOL achieves an F1-score of 78%, while generalizing effectively to the LOGICCLIMATE dataset with an F1-score of 80%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14701v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scene text synthesis involves rendering specified texts onto arbitrary images. Current methods typically formulate this task in an end-to-end manner but lack effective character-level guidance during training. Besides, their text encoders, pre-trained on a single font type, struggle to adapt to the diverse font styles encountered in practical applications. Consequently, these methods suffer from character distortion, repetition, and absence, particularly in polystylistic scenarios. To this end, this paper proposes DreamText for high-fidelity scene text synthesis. Our key idea is to reconstruct the diffusion training process, introducing more refined guidance tailored to this task, to expose and rectify the model's attention at the character level and strengthen its learning of text regions. This transformation poses a hybrid optimization challenge, involving both discrete and continuous variables. To effectively tackle this challenge, we employ a heuristic alternate optimization strategy. Meanwhile, we jointly train the text encoder and generator to comprehensively learn and utilize the diverse font present in the training dataset. This joint training is seamlessly integrated into the alternate optimization process, fostering a synergistic relationship between learning character embedding and re-estimating character attention. Specifically, in each step, we first encode potential character-generated position information from cross-attention maps into latent character masks. These masks are then utilized to update the representation of specific characters in the current step, which, in turn, enables the generator to correct the character's attention in the subsequent steps. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Visual Description Grounding Reduces Hallucinations and Boosts Reasoning in LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often produce responses that misalign with factual information, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. While hallucinations are well-studied, the exact causes behind them remain underexplored. In this paper, we first investigate the root causes of hallucinations in LVLMs. Our findings reveal that existing mitigation techniques primarily reduce hallucinations for visual recognition prompts-those that require simple descriptions of visual elements-but fail for cognitive prompts that demand deliberate reasoning. We identify the core issue as a lack of true visual perception in LVLMs: although they can accurately recognize visual elements, they struggle to fully interpret these elements in the context of the input prompt and effectively link this recognition to their internal knowledge, which is critical for reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce Visual Description Grounded Decoding (VDGD), a simple, robust, and training-free method designed to enhance visual perception and improve reasoning capabilities in LVLMs. VDGD works by first generating a detailed description of the image and appending it as a prefix to the instruction. During response generation, tokens are sampled based on their KL divergence to the description, favoring candidates with lower divergence. Experimental results on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate that VDGD consistently outperforms existing baselines 2% - 33%. Finally, we introduce VaLLu, a benchmark designed for comprehensive evaluation of the cognitive capabilities of LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Towards One Model for Classical Dimensionality Reduction: A Probabilistic Perspective on UMAP and t-SNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in ProbDR, that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate of the data precision matrix) using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, by showing that variances corresponding to these covariances are low (potentially misspecified), and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Mechanics of Feature Learning: Bottleneck Structure in Leaky ResNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Leaky ResNets, which interpolate between ResNets and Fully-Connected nets depending on an 'effective depth' hyper-parameter $\tilde{L}$. In the infinite depth limit, we study 'representation geodesics' $A_{p}$: continuous paths in representation space (similar to NeuralODEs) from input $p=0$ to output $p=1$ that minimize the parameter norm of the network. We give a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian reformulation, which highlight the importance of two terms: a kinetic energy which favors small layer derivatives $\partial_{p}A_{p}$ and a potential energy that favors low-dimensional representations, as measured by the 'Cost of Identity'. The balance between these two forces offers an intuitive understanding of feature learning in ResNets. We leverage this intuition to explain the emergence of a bottleneck structure, as observed in previous work: for large $\tilde{L}$ the potential energy dominates and leads to a separation of timescales, where the representation jumps rapidly from the high dimensional inputs to a low-dimensional representation, move slowly inside the space of low-dimensional representations, before jumping back to the potentially high-dimensional outputs. Inspired by this phenomenon, we train with an adaptive layer step-size to adapt to the separation of timescales.</description>

      <title>OlympicArena: Benchmarking Multi-discipline Cognitive Reasoning for Superintelligent AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly accelerated by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), gradually showcasing potential cognitive reasoning abilities in problem-solving and scientific discovery (i.e., AI4Science) once exclusive to human intellect. To comprehensively evaluate current models' performance in cognitive reasoning abilities, we introduce OlympicArena, which includes 11,163 bilingual problems across both text-only and interleaved text-image modalities. These challenges encompass a wide range of disciplines spanning seven fields and 62 international Olympic competitions, rigorously examined for data leakage. We argue that the challenges in Olympic competition problems are ideal for evaluating AI's cognitive reasoning due to their complexity and interdisciplinary nature, which are essential for tackling complex scientific challenges and facilitating discoveries. Beyond evaluating performance across various disciplines using answer-only criteria, we conduct detailed experiments and analyses from multiple perspectives. We delve into the models' cognitive reasoning abilities, their performance across different modalities, and their outcomes in process-level evaluations, which are vital for tasks requiring complex reasoning with lengthy solutions. Our extensive evaluations reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o only achieve a 39.97% overall accuracy, illustrating current AI limitations in complex reasoning and multimodal integration. Through the OlympicArena, we aim to advance AI towards superintelligence, equipping it to address more complex challenges in science and beyond. We also provide a comprehensive set of resources to support AI research, including a benchmark dataset, an open-source annotation platform, a detailed evaluation tool, and a leaderboard with automatic submission features.</description>

      <title>How DNNs break the Curse of Dimensionality: Compositionality and Symmetry Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that deep neural networks (DNNs) can efficiently learn any composition of functions with bounded $F_{1}$-norm, which allows DNNs to break the curse of dimensionality in ways that shallow networks cannot. More specifically, we derive a generalization bound that combines a covering number argument for compositionality, and the $F_{1}$-norm (or the related Barron norm) for large width adaptivity. We show that the global minimizer of the regularized loss of DNNs can fit for example the composition of two functions $f^{*}=h\circ g$ from a small number of observations, assuming $g$ is smooth/regular and reduces the dimensionality (e.g. $g$ could be the quotient map of the symmetries of $f^{*}$), so that $h$ can be learned in spite of its low regularity. The measures of regularity we consider is the Sobolev norm with different levels of differentiability, which is well adapted to the $F_{1}$ norm. We compute scaling laws empirically and observe phase transitions depending on whether $g$ or $h$ is harder to learn, as predicted by our theory.</description>

      <title>Detecting new obfuscated malware variants: A lightweight and interpretable machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has been successfully applied in developing malware detection systems, with a primary focus on accuracy, and increasing attention to reducing computational overhead and improving model interpretability. However, an important question remains underexplored: How well can machine learning-based models detect entirely new forms of malware not present in the training data? In this study, we present a machine learning-based system for detecting obfuscated malware that is not only highly accurate, lightweight and interpretable, but also capable of successfully adapting to new types of malware attacks. Our system is capable of detecting 15 malware subtypes despite being exclusively trained on one malware subtype, namely the Transponder from the Spyware family. This system was built after training 15 distinct random forest-based models, each on a different malware subtype from the CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset. These models were evaluated against the entire range of malware subtypes, including all unseen malware subtypes. To maintain the system's streamlined nature, training was confined to the top five most important features, which also enhanced interpretability. The Transponder-focused model exhibited high accuracy, exceeding 99.8%, with an average processing speed of 5.7 microseconds per file. We also illustrate how the Shapley additive explanations technique can facilitate the interpretation of the model predictions. Our research contributes to advancing malware detection methodologies, pioneering the feasibility of detecting obfuscated malware by exclusively training a model on a single or a few carefully selected malware subtypes and applying it to detect unseen subtypes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Search Engines and Large Language Models for Answering Health Questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search engines (SEs) have traditionally been primary tools for information seeking, but the new Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful alternatives, particularly for question-answering tasks. This study compares the performance of four popular SEs, seven LLMs, and retrieval-augmented (RAG) variants in answering 150 health-related questions from the TREC Health Misinformation (HM) Track. Results reveal SEs correctly answer between 50 and 70% of questions, often hindered by many retrieval results not responding to the health question. LLMs deliver higher accuracy, correctly answering about 80% of questions, though their performance is sensitive to input prompts. RAG methods significantly enhance smaller LLMs' effectiveness, improving accuracy by up to 30% by integrating retrieval evidence.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised pre-training with diffusion model for few-shot landmark detection in x-ray images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been extensively applied in the medical domain for various tasks, including image classification, segmentation, and landmark detection. However, their application is often hindered by data scarcity, both in terms of available annotations and images. This study introduces a novel application of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to the landmark detection task, specifically addressing the challenge of limited annotated data in x-ray imaging. Our key innovation lies in leveraging DDPMs for self-supervised pre-training in landmark detection, a previously unexplored approach in this domain. This method enables accurate landmark detection with minimal annotated training data (as few as 50 images), surpassing both ImageNet supervised pre-training and traditional self-supervised techniques across three popular x-ray benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this work represents the first application of diffusion models for self-supervised learning in landmark detection, which may offer a valuable pre-training approach in few-shot regimes, for mitigating data scarcity.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Virtual Sensing in Complex Systems: Addressing Heterogeneous Temporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time condition monitoring is crucial for the reliable and efficient operation of complex systems. However, relying solely on physical sensors can be limited due to their cost, placement constraints, or inability to directly measure certain critical parameters. Virtual sensing addresses these limitations by leveraging readily available sensor data and system knowledge to estimate inaccessible parameters or infer system states. The increasing complexity of industrial systems necessitates deployments of sensors with diverse modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states. These sensors capture data at varying frequencies to monitor both rapid and slowly varying system dynamics, as well as local and global state evolutions of the systems. This leads to heterogeneous temporal dynamics, which, particularly under varying operational end environmental conditions, pose a significant challenge for accurate virtual sensing. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (HTGNN) framework. HTGNN explicitly models signals from diverse sensors and integrates operating conditions into the model architecture. We evaluate HTGNN using two newly released datasets: a bearing dataset with diverse load conditions for bearing load prediction and a year-long simulated dataset for predicting bridge live loads. Our results demonstrate that HTGNN significantly outperforms established baseline methods in both tasks, particularly under highly varying operating conditions. These results highlight HTGNN's potential as a robust and accurate virtual sensing approach for complex systems, paving the way for improved monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced system performance. Our code and data are available under https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/htgnn.</description>

      <title>A Backbone for Long-Horizon Robot Task Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end robot learning, particularly for long-horizon tasks, often results in unpredictable outcomes and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Therblig-Based Backbone Framework (TBBF) as a fundamental structure to enhance interpretability, data efficiency, and generalization in robotic systems. TBBF utilizes expert demonstrations to enable therblig-level task decomposition, facilitate efficient action-object mapping, and generate adaptive trajectories for new scenarios. The approach consists of two stages: offline training and online testing. During the offline training stage, we developed the Meta-RGate SynerFusion (MGSF) network for accurate therblig segmentation across various tasks. In the online testing stage, after a one-shot demonstration of a new task is collected, our MGSF network extracts high-level knowledge, which is then encoded into the image using Action Registration (ActionREG). Additionally, Large Language Model (LLM)-Alignment Policy for Visual Correction (LAP-VC) is employed to ensure precise action registration, facilitating trajectory transfer in novel robot scenarios. Experimental results validate these methods, achieving 94.37% recall in therblig segmentation and success rates of 94.4% and 80% in real-world online robot testing for simple and complex scenarios, respectively.

      <title>Explaining Caption-Image Interactions in CLIP models with Second-Order Attributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual encoder architectures like CLIP models map two types of inputs into a shared embedding space and predict similarities between them. Despite their success, it is, however, not understood how these models compare their two inputs. Common first-order feature-attribution methods can only provide limited insights into dual-encoders since their predictions depend on feature-interactions rather than on individual features. In this paper, we first derive a second-order method enabling the attribution of predictions by any differentiable dual encoder onto feature-interactions between its inputs. Second, we apply our method to CLIP models and show that they learn fine-grained correspondences between parts of captions and regions in images. They match objects across input modes also account for mismatches. This visual-linguistic grounding ability, however, varies heavily between object classes and exhibits pronounced out-of-domain effects. We can identify individual errors as well as systematic failure categories including object coverage, unusual scenes and correlated contexts.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Matcher: Leveraging Large Models to Reduce Uncertainty in Schema Matching Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schema matching is the process of identifying correspondences between the elements of two given schemata, essential for database management systems, data integration, and data warehousing. For datasets across different scenarios, the optimal schema matching algorithm is different. For single algorithm, hyperparameter tuning also cases multiple results. All results assigned equal probabilities are stored in probabilistic databases to facilitate uncertainty management. The substantial degree of uncertainty diminishes the efficiency and reliability of data processing, thereby precluding the provision of more accurate information for decision-makers. To address this problem, we introduce a new approach based on fine-grained correspondence verification with specific prompt of Large Language Model.
  Our approach is an iterative loop that consists of three main components: (1) the correspondence selection algorithm, (2) correspondence verification, and (3) the update of probability distribution. The core idea is that correspondences intersect across multiple results, thereby linking the verification of correspondences to the reduction of uncertainty in candidate results.
  The task of selecting an optimal correspondence set to maximize the anticipated uncertainty reduction within a fixed budgetary framework is established as an NP-hard problem. We propose a novel $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm that significantly outperforms brute algorithm in terms of computational efficiency. To enhance correspondence verification, we have developed two prompt templates that enable GPT-4 to achieve state-of-the-art performance across two established benchmark datasets. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the superior effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Legal Fact Prediction: The Missing Piece in Legal Judgment Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP), which enables litigants and their lawyers to forecast judgment outcomes and refine litigation strategies, has emerged as a crucial legal NLP task. Existing studies typically utilize legal facts, i.e., facts that have been established by evidence and determined by the judge, to predict the judgment. However, legal facts are often difficult to obtain in the early stages of litigation, significantly limiting the practical applicability of fact-based LJP. To address this limitation, we propose a novel legal NLP task: \textit{legal fact prediction} (LFP), which takes the evidence submitted by litigants for trial as input to predict legal facts, thereby empowering fact-based LJP technologies to perform prediction in the absence of ground-truth legal facts. We also propose the first benchmark dataset, LFPBench, for evaluating the LFP task. Our extensive experiments on LFPBench demonstrate the effectiveness of LFP-empowered LJP and highlight promising research directions for LFP. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/HPRCEST/LFPBench.</description>

      <title>Advancing Depth Anything Model for Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation in Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depth estimation is a cornerstone of 3D reconstruction and plays a vital role in minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, most current depth estimation networks rely on traditional convolutional neural networks, which are limited in their ability to capture global information. Foundation models offer a promising approach to enhance depth estimation, but those models currently available are primarily trained on natural images, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to endoscopic images. In this work, we introduce a novel fine-tuning strategy for the Depth Anything Model and integrate it with an intrinsic-based unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework. Our approach includes a low-rank adaptation technique based on random vectors, which improves the model's adaptability to different scales. Additionally, we propose a residual block built on depthwise separable convolution to compensate for the transformer's limited ability to capture local features. Our experimental results on the SCARED dataset and Hamlyn dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while minimizing the number of trainable parameters. Applying this method in minimally invasive endoscopic surgery can enhance surgeons' spatial awareness, thereby improving the precision and safety of the procedures.</description>

      <title>InfoDisent: Explainability of Image Classification Models by Information Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce InfoDisent, a hybrid approach to explainability based on the information bottleneck principle. InfoDisent enables the disentanglement of information in the final layer of any pretrained model into atomic concepts, which can be interpreted as prototypical parts. This approach merges the flexibility of post-hoc methods with the concept-level modeling capabilities of self-explainable neural networks, such as ProtoPNets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoDisent through computational experiments and user studies across various datasets using modern backbones such as ViTs and convolutional networks. Notably, InfoDisent generalizes the prototypical parts approach to novel domains (ImageNet).</description>

      <title>Measuring Human and AI Values Based on Generative Psychometrics with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an LLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in text-revealed selective perceptions. The core idea is to dynamically parse unstructured texts into perceptions akin to static stimuli in traditional psychometrics, measure the value orientations they reveal, and aggregate the results. Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity, and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form outputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety. Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation psychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single Concept Vector: Modeling Concept Subspace in LLMs with Gaussian Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing learned concepts in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding how semantic knowledge is encoded internally. Training linear classifiers on probing tasks is a principle approach to denote the vector of a certain concept in the representation space. However, the single vector identified for a concept varies with both data and training, making it less robust and weakening its effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an approach to approximate the subspace representing a specific concept. Built on linear probing classifiers, we extend the concept vectors into Gaussian Concept Subspace (GCS). We demonstrate GCS's effectiveness through measuring its faithfulness and plausibility across multiple LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Additionally, we use representation intervention tasks to showcase its efficacy in real-world applications such as emotion steering. Experimental results indicate that GCS concept vectors have the potential to balance steering performance and maintaining the fluency in natural language generation tasks.</description>

      <title>HelpSteer2-Preference: Complementing Ratings with Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward models are critical for aligning models to follow instructions, and are typically trained following one of two popular paradigms: Bradley-Terry style or Regression style. However, there is a lack of evidence that either approach is better than the other, when adequately matched for data. This is primarily because these approaches require data collected in different (but incompatible) formats, meaning that adequately matched data is not available in existing public datasets. To tackle this problem, we release preference annotations (designed for Bradley-Terry training) to complement existing ratings (designed for Regression style training) in the HelpSteer2 dataset. To improve data interpretability, preference annotations are accompanied with human-written justifications. Using this data, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of Bradley-Terry and Regression models when adequately matched for data. Based on insights derived from such a comparison, we propose a novel approach to combine Bradley-Terry and Regression reward modeling. A Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model tuned with this approach scores 94.1 on RewardBench, emerging top of more than 140 reward models as of 1 Oct 2024. This reward model can then be used with REINFORCE algorithm (RLHF) to align an Instruct model to reach 85.0 on Arena Hard, which is No. 1 as of 1 Oct 2024. We open-source this dataset (CC-BY-4.0 license) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2#preferences-new -- 1-oct-2024 and openly release the trained Reward and Instruct models at https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward and https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct</description>

      <title>TIGER: Time-frequency Interleaved Gain Extraction and Reconstruction for Efficient Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, much speech separation research has focused primarily on improving model performance. However, for low-latency speech processing systems, high efficiency is equally important. Therefore, we propose a speech separation model with significantly reduced parameters and computational costs: Time-frequency Interleaved Gain Extraction and Reconstruction network (TIGER). TIGER leverages prior knowledge to divide frequency bands and compresses frequency information. We employ a multi-scale selective attention module to extract contextual features while introducing a full-frequency-frame attention module to capture both temporal and frequency contextual information. Additionally, to more realistically evaluate the performance of speech separation models in complex acoustic environments, we introduce a dataset called EchoSet. This dataset includes noise and more realistic reverberation (e.g., considering object occlusions and material properties), with speech from two speakers overlapping at random proportions. Experimental results showed that models trained on EchoSet had better generalization ability than those trained on other datasets compared to the data collected in the physical world, which validated the practical value of the EchoSet. On EchoSet and real-world data, TIGER significantly reduces the number of parameters by 94.3% and the MACs by 95.3% while achieving performance surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model TF-GridNet.</description>

      <title>SonicSim: A customizable simulation platform for speech processing in moving sound source scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systematic evaluation of speech separation and enhancement models under moving sound source conditions requires extensive and diverse data. However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets. The code is publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</description>

      <title>HELMET: How to Evaluate Long-Context Language Models Effectively and Thoroughly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many benchmarks exist for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs), yet developers often rely on synthetic tasks such as needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) or an arbitrary subset of tasks. However, it remains unclear whether these benchmarks reflect the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and such inconsistencies further complicate model comparison. We investigate the underlying reasons behind these practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals due to limited coverage of applications, insufficient context lengths, unreliable metrics, and incompatibility with base models. In this work, we introduce HELMET (How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories. We also address several issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to 128K tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot prompting for robustly evaluating base models. Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs. Through a comprehensive study of 59 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH do not reliably predict downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlations with each other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly lag behind closed ones when tasks require full-context reasoning or following complex instructions -- the gap widens as length increases. Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to run and better predict other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>SymmetricDiffusers: Learning Discrete Diffusion on Finite Symmetric Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite symmetric groups $S_n$ are essential in fields such as combinatorics, physics, and chemistry. However, learning a probability distribution over $S_n$ poses significant challenges due to its intractable size and discrete nature. In this paper, we introduce SymmetricDiffusers, a novel discrete diffusion model that simplifies the task of learning a complicated distribution over $S_n$ by decomposing it into learning simpler transitions of the reverse diffusion using deep neural networks. We identify the riffle shuffle as an effective forward transition and provide empirical guidelines for selecting the diffusion length based on the theory of random walks on finite groups. Additionally, we propose a generalized Plackett-Luce (PL) distribution for the reverse transition, which is provably more expressive than the PL distribution. We further introduce a theoretically grounded "denoising schedule" to improve sampling and learning efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performances on solving tasks including sorting 4-digit MNIST images, jigsaw puzzles, and traveling salesman problems. Our code is released at https://github.com/DSL-Lab/SymmetricDiffusers.</description>

      <title>PostEdit: Posterior Sampling for Efficient Zero-Shot Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of image editing, three core challenges persist: controllability, background preservation, and efficiency. Inversion-based methods rely on time-consuming optimization to preserve the features of the initial images, which results in low efficiency due to the requirement for extensive network inference. Conversely, inversion-free methods lack theoretical support for background similarity, as they circumvent the issue of maintaining initial features to achieve efficiency. As a consequence, none of these methods can achieve both high efficiency and background consistency. To tackle the challenges and the aforementioned disadvantages, we introduce PostEdit, a method that incorporates a posterior scheme to govern the diffusion sampling process. Specifically, a corresponding measurement term related to both the initial features and Langevin dynamics is introduced to optimize the estimated image generated by the given target prompt. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed PostEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance while accurately preserving unedited regions. Furthermore, the method is both inversion- and training-free, necessitating approximately 1.5 seconds and 18 GB of GPU memory to generate high-quality results.</description>

      <title>Human-Feedback Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Online Diffusion Model Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controllable generation through Stable Diffusion (SD) fine-tuning aims to improve fidelity, safety, and alignment with human guidance. Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback methods usually rely on predefined heuristic reward functions or pretrained reward models built on large-scale datasets, limiting their applicability to scenarios where collecting such data is costly or difficult. To effectively and efficiently utilize human feedback, we develop a framework, HERO, which leverages online human feedback collected on the fly during model learning. Specifically, HERO features two key mechanisms: (1) Feedback-Aligned Representation Learning, an online training method that captures human feedback and provides informative learning signals for fine-tuning, and (2) Feedback-Guided Image Generation, which involves generating images from SD's refined initialization samples, enabling faster convergence towards the evaluator's intent. We demonstrate that HERO is 4x more efficient in online feedback for body part anomaly correction compared to the best existing method. Additionally, experiments show that HERO can effectively handle tasks like reasoning, counting, personalization, and reducing NSFW content with only 0.5K online feedback.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Multi-Permutation Equivariance through the Lens of Irreducible Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the characterization of equivariant linear layers for representations of permutations and related groups. Unlike traditional approaches, which address these problems using parameter-sharing, we consider an alternative methodology based on irreducible representations and Schur's lemma. Using this methodology, we obtain an alternative derivation for existing models like DeepSets, 2-IGN graph equivariant networks, and Deep Weight Space (DWS) networks. The derivation for DWS networks is significantly simpler than that of previous results.
  Next, we extend our approach to unaligned symmetric sets, where equivariance to the wreath product of groups is required. Previous works have addressed this problem in a rather restrictive setting, in which almost all wreath equivariant layers are Siamese. In contrast, we give a full characterization of layers in this case and show that there is a vast number of additional non-Siamese layers in some settings. We also show empirically that these additional non-Siamese layers can improve performance in tasks like graph anomaly detection, weight space alignment, and learning Wasserstein distances. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Irreducible-Representations-of-Deep-Weight-Spaces}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>Pap2Pat: Benchmarking Outline-Guided Long-Text Patent Generation with Patent-Paper Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dealing with long and highly complex technical text is a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), which still have to unfold their potential in supporting expensive and timeintensive processes like patent drafting. Within patents, the description constitutes more than 90% of the document on average. Yet, its automatic generation remains understudied. When drafting patent applications, patent attorneys typically receive invention reports (IRs), which are usually confidential, hindering research on LLM-supported patent drafting. Often, prepublication research papers serve as IRs. We leverage this duality to build PAP2PAT, an open and realistic benchmark for patent drafting consisting of 1.8k patent-paper pairs describing the same inventions. To address the complex longdocument patent generation task, we propose chunk-based outline-guided generation using the research paper as invention specification. Our extensive evaluation using PAP2PAT and a human case study show that LLMs can effectively leverage information from the paper, but still struggle to provide the necessary level of detail. Fine-tuning leads to more patent-style language, but also to more hallucination. We release our data and code https://github.com/boschresearch/Pap2Pat.</description>

Abstract: Recent works show we can linearize large language models (LLMs) -- swapping the quadratic attentions of popular Transformer-based LLMs with subquadratic analogs, such as linear attention -- avoiding the expensive pretraining costs. However, linearizing LLMs often significantly degrades model quality, still requires training over billions of tokens, and remains limited to smaller 1.3B to 7B LLMs. We thus propose Low-rank Linear Conversion via Attention Transfer (LoLCATs), a simple two-step method that improves LLM linearizing quality with orders of magnitudes less memory and compute. We base these steps on two findings. First, we can replace an LLM's softmax attentions with closely-approximating linear attentions, simply by training the linear attentions to match their softmax counterparts with an output MSE loss ("attention transfer"). Then, this enables adjusting for approximation errors and recovering LLM quality simply with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, training efficiency, and scalability. We significantly reduce the linearizing quality gap and produce state-of-the-art subquadratic LLMs from Llama 3 8B and Mistral 7B v0.1, leading to 20+ points of improvement on 5-shot MMLU. Furthermore, LoLCATs does so with only 0.2% of past methods' model parameters and 0.4% of their training tokens. Finally, we apply LoLCATs to create the first linearized 70B and 405B LLMs (50x larger than prior work). When compared with prior approaches under the same compute budgets, LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, closing the gap between linearized and original Llama 3.1 70B and 405B LLMs by 77.8% and 78.1% on 5-shot MMLU.</description>

      <title>Improving Data Efficiency via Curating LLM-Driven Rating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is critical for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, and recent studies have demonstrated that small amounts of human-curated data can outperform larger datasets, challenging traditional data scaling laws. While LLM-based data quality rating systems offer a cost-effective alternative to human annotation, they often suffer from inaccuracies and biases, even in powerful models like GPT-4. In this work, we introduce DS2, a Diversity-aware Score curation method for Data Selection. By systematically modeling error patterns through a score transition matrix, DS2 corrects LLM-based scores and promotes diversity in the selected data samples. Our approach shows that a curated subset (just 3.3% of the original dataset) outperforms full-scale datasets (300k samples) across various machine-alignment benchmarks, and matches or surpasses human-aligned datasets such as LIMA with the same sample size (1k samples). These findings challenge conventional data scaling assumptions, highlighting that redundant, low-quality samples can degrade performance and reaffirming that "more can be less."</description>

      <title>Understanding Expert Structures on Minimax Parameter Estimation in Contaminated Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct the convergence analysis of parameter estimation in the contaminated mixture of experts. This model is motivated from the prompt learning problem where ones utilize prompts, which can be formulated as experts, to fine-tune a large-scale pre-trained model for learning downstream tasks. There are two fundamental challenges emerging from the analysis: (i) the proportion in the mixture of the pre-trained model and the prompt may converge to zero during the training, leading to the prompt vanishing issue; (ii) the algebraic interaction among parameters of the pre-trained model and the prompt can occur via some partial differential equations and decelerate the prompt learning. In response, we introduce a distinguishability condition to control the previous parameter interaction. Additionally, we also investigate various types of expert structure to understand their effects on the convergence behavior of parameter estimation. In each scenario, we provide comprehensive convergence rates of parameter estimation along with the corresponding minimax lower bounds. Finally, we run several numerical experiments to empirically justify our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>CATCH: Channel-Aware multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection via Frequency Patching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging as heterogeneous subsequence anomalies may occur. Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning normal patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising results, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance. We make our code and datasets available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/CATCH.</description>

      <title>Towards Edge General Intelligence via Large Language Models: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge Intelligence (EI) has been instrumental in delivering real-time, localized services by leveraging the computational capabilities of edge networks. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) empowers EI to evolve into the next stage: Edge General Intelligence (EGI), enabling more adaptive and versatile applications that require advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, systematic exploration in this area remains insufficient. This survey delineates the distinctions between EGI and traditional EI, categorizing LLM-empowered EGI into three conceptual systems: centralized, hybrid, and decentralized. For each system, we detail the framework designs and review existing implementations. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance and throughput of various Small Language Models (SLMs) that are more suitable for development on edge devices. This survey provides researchers with a comprehensive vision of EGI, offering insights into its vast potential and establishing a foundation for future advancements in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Search-Based Path Planning in Interactive Environments among Movable Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Path planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO), which seeks a minimum cost collision-free path among static obstacles from start to goal while allowing the robot to push away movable obstacles (i.e., objects) along its path when needed. To develop planners that are complete and optimal for PAMO, the planner has to search a giant state space involving both the location of the robot as well as the locations of the objects, which grows exponentially with respect to the number of objects. This paper leverages a simple yet under-explored idea that, only a small fraction of this giant state space needs to be searched during planning as guided by a heuristic, and most of the objects far away from the robot are intact, which thus leads to runtime efficient algorithms. Based on this idea, this paper introduces two PAMO formulations, i.e., bi-objective and resource constrained problems in an occupancy grid, and develops PAMO*, a planning method with completeness and solution optimality guarantees, to solve the two problems. We then further extend PAMO* to hybrid-state PAMO* to plan in continuous spaces with high-fidelity interaction between the robot and the objects. Our results show that, PAMO* can often find optimal solutions within a second in cluttered maps with up to 400 objects.</description>

      <title>Stealthy Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models via Benign Data Mirroring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) safety is a critical issue, with numerous studies employing red team testing to enhance model security. Among these, jailbreak methods explore potential vulnerabilities by crafting malicious prompts that induce model outputs contrary to safety alignments. Existing black-box jailbreak methods often rely on model feedback, repeatedly submitting queries with detectable malicious instructions during the attack search process. Although these approaches are effective, the attacks may be intercepted by content moderators during the search process. We propose an improved transfer attack method that guides malicious prompt construction by locally training a mirror model of the target black-box model through benign data distillation. This method offers enhanced stealth, as it does not involve submitting identifiable malicious instructions to the target model during the search phase. Our approach achieved a maximum attack success rate of 92%, or a balanced value of 80% with an average of 1.5 detectable jailbreak queries per sample against GPT-3.5 Turbo on a subset of AdvBench. These results underscore the need for more robust defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>AutoBench-V: Can Large Vision-Language Models Benchmark Themselves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become essential for advancing the integration of visual and linguistic information. However, the evaluation of LVLMs presents significant challenges as the evaluation benchmark always demands lots of human cost for its construction, and remains static, lacking flexibility once constructed. Even though automatic evaluation has been explored in textual modality, the visual modality remains under-explored. As a result, in this work, we address a question: "Can LVLMs themselves be used to benchmark each other in the visual automatically domain?". We introduce AutoBench-V, an automated framework for serving evaluation on demand, i.e., benchmarking LVLMs based on specific aspects of model capability. AutoBench-V leverages text-to-image models to generate relevant image samples and then utilizes LVLMs to orchestrate visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, completing the evaluation process efficiently and flexibly. Through an extensive evaluation of nine popular LVLMs across five demanded user inputs (i.e., evaluation capabilities), the framework shows effectiveness and reliability.</description>

      <title>DexMimicGen: Automated Data Generation for Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation via Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective means to teach robots manipulation skills. But data acquisition is a major bottleneck in applying this paradigm more broadly, due to the amount of cost and human effort involved. There has been significant interest in imitation learning for bimanual dexterous robots, like humanoids. Unfortunately, data collection is even more challenging here due to the challenges of simultaneously controlling multiple arms and multi-fingered hands. Automated data generation in simulation is a compelling, scalable alternative to fuel this need for data. To this end, we introduce DexMimicGen, a large-scale automated data generation system that synthesizes trajectories from a handful of human demonstrations for humanoid robots with dexterous hands. We present a collection of simulation environments in the setting of bimanual dexterous manipulation, spanning a range of manipulation behaviors and different requirements for coordination among the two arms. We generate 21K demos across these tasks from just 60 source human demos and study the effect of several data generation and policy learning decisions on agent performance. Finally, we present a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline and deploy it on a real-world humanoid can sorting task. Generated datasets, simulation environments and additional results are at https://dexmimicgen.github.io/</description>

      <title>ACC-Collab: An Actor-Critic Approach to Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to serve as general-purpose tools for various language-based tasks. Recent works have demonstrated that the efficacy of such models can be improved through iterative dialog between multiple models. While these paradigms show promise in improving model efficacy, most works in this area treat collaboration as an emergent behavior, rather than a learned behavior. In doing so, current multi-agent frameworks rely on collaborative behaviors to have been sufficiently trained into off-the-shelf models. To address this limitation, we propose ACC-Collab, an Actor-Critic based learning framework to produce a two-agent team (an actor-agent and a critic-agent) specialized in collaboration. We demonstrate that ACC-Collab outperforms SotA multi-agent techniques on a wide array of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Prompting with Phonemes: Enhancing LLMs' Multilinguality for Non-Latin Script Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although multilingual LLMs have achieved remarkable performance across benchmarks, we find they continue to underperform on non-Latin script languages across contemporary LLM families. This discrepancy arises from the fact that LLMs are pretrained with orthographic scripts, which are dominated by Latin characters that obscure their shared phonology with non-Latin scripts. We propose leveraging phonemic transcriptions as complementary signals to induce script-invariant representations. Our study demonstrates that integrating phonemic signals improves performance across both non-Latin and Latin script languages, with a particularly significant impact on closing the performance gap between the two. Through detailed experiments, we show that phonemic and orthographic scripts retrieve distinct examples for in-context learning (ICL). This motivates our proposed Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy, where further aggregation from both leads to our significant performance improvements for both Latin script languages (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin script languages (up to 15.1%) compared to randomized ICL retrieval.</description>

      <title>StoryTeller: Improving Long Video Description through Global Audio-Visual Character Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are largely limited to processing short, seconds-long videos and struggle with generating coherent descriptions for extended video spanning minutes or more. Long video description introduces new challenges, such as consistent character identification and plot-level descriptions incorporating both visual and audio information. To address these, we figure out audio-visual character identification, matching character names to each dialogue, as a key factor. We propose StoryTeller, a system for generating dense descriptions of long videos, incorporating both low-level visual concepts and high-level plot information. StoryTeller uses a multimodal large language model that integrates visual, audio, and text modalities to perform audio-visual character identification on minute-long video clips. The results are then fed into a LVLM to enhance consistency of video description. We validate our approach on movie description tasks and introduce MovieStory101, a dataset with dense descriptions for three-minute movie clips. To evaluate long video descriptions, we create StoryQA, a large set of multiple-choice questions for MovieStory101 test set. We assess descriptions by inputting them into GPT-4 to answer these questions, using accuracy as an automatic evaluation metric. Experiments show that StoryTeller outperforms all open and closed-source baselines on StoryQA, achieving 9.5% higher accuracy than the strongest baseline, Gemini-1.5-pro, and demonstrating a +15.56% advantage in human side-by-side evaluations. Additionally, incorporating audio-visual character identification from StoryTeller improves the performance of all video description models, with Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o showing relative improvement of 5.5% and 13.0%, respectively, in accuracy on StoryQA.</description>

      <title>Gumbel Counterfactual Generation From Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07180v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating the causal generation mechanisms in language models is essential for controlling their behavior. Previous work has primarily relied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or manipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to \emph{intervene} on these models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is useful to examine \emph{counterfactuals} -- e.g., how a given sentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating true string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural equation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel counterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint distribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the same instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on hindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables and generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while at the same time showing that commonly used intervention techniques have considerable undesired side effects.</description>

      <title>BackdoorMBTI: A Backdoor Learning Multimodal Benchmark Tool Kit for Backdoor Defense Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, the emergence of backdoor attacks has presented significant challenges to deep learning systems, allowing attackers to insert backdoors into neural networks. When data with a trigger is processed by a backdoor model, it can lead to mispredictions targeted by attackers, whereas normal data yields regular results. The scope of backdoor attacks is expanding beyond computer vision and encroaching into areas such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Nevertheless, existing backdoor defense methods are typically tailored to specific data modalities, restricting their application in multimodal contexts. While multimodal learning proves highly applicable in facial recognition, sentiment analysis, action recognition, visual question answering, the security of these models remains a crucial concern. Specifically, there are no existing backdoor benchmarks targeting multimodal applications or related tasks.
  In order to facilitate the research in multimodal backdoor, we introduce BackdoorMBTI, the first backdoor learning toolkit and benchmark designed for multimodal evaluation across three representative modalities from eleven commonly used datasets. BackdoorMBTI provides a systematic backdoor learning pipeline, encompassing data processing, data poisoning, backdoor training, and evaluation. The generated poison datasets and backdoor models enable detailed evaluation of backdoor defenses. Given the diversity of modalities, BackdoorMBTI facilitates systematic evaluation across different data types. Furthermore, BackdoorMBTI offers a standardized approach to handling practical factors in backdoor learning, such as issues related to data quality and erroneous labels.

      <title>Training and Evaluating Language Models with Template-based Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama has significantly transformed natural language processing, showcasing remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language. However, these models often struggle with tasks requiring complex reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving, due in part to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for training sophisticated reasoning abilities. To address this limitation, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel approach that leverages LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which are then used to synthesize a vast array of high-quality problems and solutions. Leveraging TDG, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a dataset comprising over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems--each accompanied by code-based and natural language solutions--with the potential to generate an effectively unlimited number more. This dataset alleviates the scarcity of large-scale mathematical datasets and serves as a valuable resource for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluating LLMs in mathematical reasoning. Our method not only enables the generation of virtually infinite data but also elevates data augmentation to a new level by using GPT-4 for meta-template generation, ensuring diverse and high-quality problem structures. The TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/math-ai/TemplateGSM. The code is available at https://github.com/iiis-ai/TemplateMath.</description>

      <title>VISION-XL: High Definition Video Inverse Problem Solver using Latent Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for solving high-definition video inverse problems using latent image diffusion models. Building on recent advancements in spatio-temporal optimization for video inverse problems using image diffusion models, our approach leverages latent-space diffusion models to achieve enhanced video quality and resolution. To address the high computational demands of processing high-resolution frames, we introduce a pseudo-batch consistent sampling strategy, allowing efficient operation on a single GPU. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency, we present pseudo-batch inversion, an initialization technique that incorporates informative latents from the measurement. By integrating with SDXL, our framework achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction across a wide range of spatio-temporal inverse problems, including complex combinations of frame averaging and various spatial degradations, such as deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Unlike previous methods, our approach supports multiple aspect ratios (landscape, vertical, and square) and delivers HD-resolution reconstructions (exceeding 1280x720) in under 6 seconds per frame on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU.</description>

      <title>Transformers Use Causal World Models in Maze-Solving Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in interpretability have explored the inner workings of transformer models trained on tasks across various domains, often discovering that these networks naturally develop highly structured representations. When such representations comprehensively reflect the task domain's structure, they are commonly referred to as "World Models" (WMs). In this work, we identify WMs in transformers trained on maze-solving tasks. By using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and analyzing attention patterns, we examine the construction of WMs and demonstrate consistency between SAE feature-based and circuit-based analyses. By subsequently intervening on isolated features to confirm their causal role, we find that it is easier to activate features than to suppress them. Furthermore, we find that models can reason about mazes involving more simultaneously active features than they encountered during training; however, when these same mazes (with greater numbers of connections) are provided to models via input tokens instead, the models fail. Finally, we demonstrate that positional encoding schemes appear to influence how World Models are structured within the model's residual stream.</description>

      <title>Back Home: A Machine Learning Approach to Seashell Classification and Ecosystem Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Costa Rica, an average of 5 tons of seashells are extracted from ecosystems annually. Confiscated seashells, cannot be returned to their ecosystems due to the lack of origin recognition. To address this issue, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) specifically for seashell identification. We built a dataset from scratch, consisting of approximately 19000 images from the Pacific and Caribbean coasts. Using this dataset, the model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding 85%. The model has been integrated into a user-friendly application, which has classified over 36,000 seashells to date, delivering real-time results within 3 seconds per image. To further enhance the system's accuracy, an anomaly detection mechanism was incorporated to filter out irrelevant or anomalous inputs, ensuring only valid seashell images are processed.</description>

      <title>Rational Tuning of LLM Cascades via Probabilistic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the reliability of large language models (LLMs) has recently garnered significant attention. Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well as their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to predict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more complex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each model's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of different models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for the joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a framework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade using continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds using grid search, our parametric Markov-copula model significantly improves runtime scaling with respect to the length of the cascade and the desired resolution of the cost-error curve, turning them from intractable into low-order polynomial. In addition, the optimal thresholds computed using our continuous optimization-based algorithm increasingly outperform those found via grid search as cascade length grows, improving the area under the cost-error curve by 1.9% on average for cascades consisting of at least three models. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in analyzing LLM systems.</description>

      <title>No More Sliding Window: Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Differentiable Top-k Patch Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D models surpass 2D models in CT/MRI segmentation by effectively capturing inter-slice relationships. However, the added depth dimension substantially increases memory consumption. While patch-based training alleviates memory constraints, it significantly slows down the inference speed due to the sliding window (SW) approach. We propose No-More-Sliding-Window (NMSW), a novel end-to-end trainable framework that enhances the efficiency of generic 3D segmentation backbone during an inference step by eliminating the need for SW. NMSW employs a differentiable Top-k module to selectively sample only the most relevant patches, thereby minimizing redundant computations. When patch-level predictions are insufficient, the framework intelligently leverages coarse global predictions to refine results. Evaluated across 3 tasks using 3 segmentation backbones, NMSW achieves competitive accuracy compared to SW inference while significantly reducing computational complexity by 91% (88.0 to 8.00 TMACs). Moreover, it delivers a 9.1x faster inference on the H100 GPU (99.0 to 8.3 sec) and a 11.1x faster inference on the Xeon Gold CPU (2110 to 189 sec). NMSW is model-agnostic, further boosting efficiency when integrated with any existing efficient segmentation backbones.</description>

      <title>Assisting Mathematical Formalization with A Learning-based Premise Retriever</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Premise selection is a crucial yet challenging step in mathematical formalization, especially for users with limited experience. Due to the lack of available formalization projects, existing approaches that leverage language models often suffer from data scarcity. In this work, we introduce an innovative method for training a premise retriever to support the formalization of mathematics. Our approach employs a BERT model to embed proof states and premises into a shared latent space. The retrieval model is trained within a contrastive learning framework and incorporates a domain-specific tokenizer along with a fine-grained similarity computation method. Experimental results show that our model is highly competitive compared to existing baselines, achieving strong performance while requiring fewer computational resources. Performance is further enhanced through the integration of a re-ranking module. To streamline the formalization process, we will release a search engine that enables users to query Mathlib theorems directly using proof states, significantly improving accessibility and efficiency.

      <title>An Efficient Sparse Kernel Generator for O(3)-Equivariant Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotation equivariant graph neural networks, i.e., networks designed to guarantee certain geometric relations between their inputs and outputs, yield state-of-the-art performance on spatial deep learning tasks. They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedup over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our fused kernels offer up to 4.5x speedup for the forward pass and 3x for the backward pass over NVIDIA cuEquivariance, as well as &gt;10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. We offer up to 5.3x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Using LLMs to Execute Multistage Network Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs have shown preliminary promise in some security tasks and CTF challenges. However, it is unclear whether LLMs are able to realize multistage network attacks, which involve executing a wide variety of actions across multiple hosts such as conducting reconnaissance, exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access, leveraging internal hosts to move laterally, and using multiple compromised hosts to exfiltrate data. We evaluate LLMs across 10 multistage networks and find that popular LLMs are unable to realize these attacks. To enable LLMs to realize these attacks, we introduce Incalmo, an LLM-agnostic high-level attack abstraction layer that sits between an LLM and the environment. Rather than LLMs issuing low-level command-line instructions, which can lead to incorrect implementations, Incalmo allows LLMs to specify high-level tasks (e.g., infect a host, scan a network), which are then carried out by Incalmo. Incalmo realizes these tasks by translating them into low-level primitives (e.g., commands to exploit tools). Incalmo also provides an environment state service and an attack graph service to provide structure to LLMs in selecting actions relevant to a multistage attack. Across 9 out of 10 realistic emulated networks (from 25 to 50 hosts), LLMs using Incalmo can successfully autonomously execute multistage attacks. We also conduct an ablation analysis to show the key role the high-level abstractions play. For instance, we find that both Incalmo's high-level tasks and services are crucial. Furthermore, even smaller-parameter LLMs with Incalmo can fully succeed in 5 of 10 environments, while larger-parameter LLMs without Incalmo do not fully succeed in any.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MultiChallenge, a pioneering benchmark evaluating large language models (LLMs) on conducting multi-turn conversations with human users, a crucial yet underexamined capability for their applications. MultiChallenge identifies four categories of challenges in multi-turn conversations that are not only common and realistic among current human-LLM interactions, but are also challenging to all current frontier LLMs. All 4 challenges require accurate instruction-following, context allocation, and in-context reasoning at the same time. We also develop LLM as judge with instance-level rubrics to facilitate an automatic evaluation method with fair agreement with experienced human raters. Despite achieving near-perfect scores on existing multi-turn evaluation benchmarks, all frontier models have less than 50% accuracy on MultiChallenge, with the top-performing Claude 3.5 Sonnet (June 2024) achieving just a 41.4% average accuracy.</description>

      <title>AdaptBot: Combining LLM with Knowledge Graphs and Human Input for Generic-to-Specific Task Decomposition and Knowledge Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An embodied agent assisting humans is often asked to complete new tasks, and there may not be sufficient time or labeled examples to train the agent to perform these new tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on considerable knowledge across many domains can be used to predict a sequence of abstract actions for completing such tasks, although the agent may not be able to execute this sequence due to task-, agent-, or domain-specific constraints. Our framework addresses these challenges by leveraging the generic predictions provided by LLM and the prior domain knowledge encoded in a Knowledge Graph (KG), enabling an agent to quickly adapt to new tasks. The robot also solicits and uses human input as needed to refine its existing knowledge. Based on experimental evaluation in the context of cooking and cleaning tasks in simulation domains, we demonstrate that the interplay between LLM, KG, and human input leads to substantial performance gains compared with just using the LLM.

      <title>MMGDreamer: Mixed-Modality Graph for Geometry-Controllable 3D Indoor Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controllable 3D scene generation has extensive applications in virtual reality and interior design, where the generated scenes should exhibit high levels of realism and controllability in terms of geometry. Scene graphs provide a suitable data representation that facilitates these applications. However, current graph-based methods for scene generation are constrained to text-based inputs and exhibit insufficient adaptability to flexible user inputs, hindering the ability to precisely control object geometry. To address this issue, we propose MMGDreamer, a dual-branch diffusion model for scene generation that incorporates a novel Mixed-Modality Graph, visual enhancement module, and relation predictor. The mixed-modality graph allows object nodes to integrate textual and visual modalities, with optional relationships between nodes. It enhances adaptability to flexible user inputs and enables meticulous control over the geometry of objects in the generated scenes. The visual enhancement module enriches the visual fidelity of text-only nodes by constructing visual representations using text embeddings. Furthermore, our relation predictor leverages node representations to infer absent relationships between nodes, resulting in more coherent scene layouts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMGDreamer exhibits superior control of object geometry, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation performance.

      <title>Select before Act: Spatially Decoupled Action Repetition for Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various continuous control tasks, such as robot manipulation and locomotion. Different to mainstream RL which makes decisions at individual steps, recent studies have incorporated action repetition into RL, achieving enhanced action persistence with improved sample efficiency and superior performance. However, existing methods treat all action dimensions as a whole during repetition, ignoring variations among them. This constraint leads to inflexibility in decisions, which reduces policy agility with inferior effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel repetition framework called SDAR, which implements Spatially Decoupled Action Repetition through performing closed-loop act-or-repeat selection for each action dimension individually. SDAR achieves more flexible repetition strategies, leading to an improved balance between action persistence and diversity. Compared to existing repetition frameworks, SDAR is more sample efficient with higher policy performance and reduced action fluctuation. Experiments are conducted on various continuous control scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of spatially decoupled repetition design proposed in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain rapidly adapts to new contexts and learns from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms struggle to mimic. Inspired by the mechanical oscillatory rhythms of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm utilizing link strength oscillations, where learning is associated with the coordination of these oscillations. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, allowing the network to sense and adapt to subtle contextual changes without supervision. The network becomes a generalist AI architecture, capable of predicting dynamics of multiple contexts including unseen ones. These results make our paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of cognition. Because our paradigm is agnostic to specifics of the neural network, our study opens doors for introducing rapid adaptive learning into leading AI models.</description>

      <title>X-Boundary: Establishing Exact Safety Boundary to Shield LLMs from Multi-Turn Jailbreaks without Compromising Usability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid development of safety alignment techniques for LLMs, defending against multi-turn jailbreaks is still a challenging task. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison, revealing that some existing defense methods can improve the robustness of LLMs against multi-turn jailbreaks but compromise usability, i.e., reducing general capabilities or causing the over-refusal problem. From the perspective of mechanism interpretability of LLMs, we discover that these methods fail to establish a boundary that exactly distinguishes safe and harmful feature representations. Therefore, boundary-safe representations close to harmful representations are inevitably disrupted, leading to a decline in usability. To address this issue, we propose X-Boundary to push harmful representations away from boundary-safe representations and obtain an exact distinction boundary. In this way, harmful representations can be precisely erased without disrupting safe ones. Experimental results show that X-Boundary achieves state-of-the-art defense performance against multi-turn jailbreaks, while reducing the over-refusal rate by about 20% and maintaining nearly complete general capability. Furthermore, we theoretically prove and empirically verify that X-Boundary can accelerate the convergence process during training.

      <title>Detecting Systematic Weaknesses in Vision Models along Predefined Human-Understandable Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slice discovery methods (SDMs) are prominent algorithms for finding systematic weaknesses in DNNs. They identify top-k semantically coherent slices/subsets of data where a DNN-under-test has low performance. For being directly useful, slices should be aligned with human-understandable and relevant dimensions, which, for example, are defined by safety and domain experts as part of the operational design domain (ODD). While SDMs can be applied effectively on structured data, their application on image data is complicated by the lack of semantic metadata. To address these issues, we present an algorithm that combines foundation models for zero-shot image classification to generate semantic metadata with methods for combinatorial search to find systematic weaknesses in images. In contrast to existing approaches, ours identifies weak slices that are in line with pre-defined human-understandable dimensions. As the algorithm includes foundation models, its intermediate and final results may not always be exact. Therefore, we include an approach to address the impact of noisy metadata. We validate our algorithm on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to recover human-understandable systematic weaknesses. Furthermore, using our approach, we identify systematic weaknesses of multiple pre-trained and publicly available state-of-the-art computer vision DNNs.</description>

      <title>R2-KG: General-Purpose Dual-Agent Framework for Reliable Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have combined Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance reasoning, improving inference accuracy without additional training while mitigating hallucination. However, existing frameworks are often rigid, struggling to adapt to KG or task changes. They also rely heavily on powerful LLMs for reliable (i.e., trustworthy) reasoning. To address this, We introduce R2-KG, a plug-and-play, dual-agent framework that separates reasoning into two roles: an Operator (a low-capacity LLM) that gathers evidence and a Supervisor (a high-capacity LLM) that makes final judgments. This design is cost-efficient for LLM inference while still maintaining strong reasoning accuracy. Additionally, R2-KG employs an Abstention mechanism, generating answers only when sufficient evidence is collected from KG, which significantly enhances reliability. Experiments across multiple KG-based reasoning tasks show that R2-KG consistently outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reliability, regardless of the inherent capability of LLMs used as the Operator. Further experiments reveal that the single-agent version of R2-KG, equipped with a strict self-consistency strategy, achieves significantly higher-than-baseline reliability while reducing inference cost. However, it also leads to a higher abstention rate in complex KGs. Our findings establish R2-KG as a flexible and cost-effective solution for KG-based reasoning. It reduces reliance on high-capacity LLMs while ensuring trustworthy inference.</description>

      <title>MobileViM: A Light-weight and Dimension-independent Vision Mamba for 3D Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13524v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient evaluation of three-dimensional (3D) medical images is crucial for diagnostic and therapeutic practices in healthcare. Recent years have seen a substantial uptake in applying deep learning and computer vision to analyse and interpret medical images. Traditional approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), face significant computational challenges, prompting the need for architectural advancements. Recent efforts have led to the introduction of novel architectures like the ``Mamba'' model as alternative solutions to traditional CNNs or ViTs. The Mamba model excels in the linear processing of one-dimensional data with low computational demands. However, Mamba's potential for 3D medical image analysis remains underexplored and could face significant computational challenges as the dimension increases. This manuscript presents MobileViM, a streamlined architecture for efficient segmentation of 3D medical images. In the MobileViM network, we invent a new dimension-independent mechanism and a dual-direction traversing approach to incorporate with a vision-Mamba-based framework. MobileViM also features a cross-scale bridging technique to improve efficiency and accuracy across various medical imaging modalities. With these enhancements, MobileViM achieves segmentation speeds exceeding 90 frames per second (FPS) on a single graphics processing unit (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 4090). This performance is over 24 FPS faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning models for processing 3D images with the same computational resources. In addition, experimental evaluations demonstrate that MobileViM delivers superior performance, with Dice similarity scores reaching 92.72%, 86.69%, 80.46%, and 77.43% for PENGWIN, BraTS2024, ATLAS, and Toothfairy2 datasets, respectively, which significantly surpasses existing models.</description>

      <title>An LLM-based Agent for Reliable Docker Environment Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environment configuration is a critical yet time-consuming step in software development, especially when dealing with unfamiliar code repositories. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the potential to accomplish software engineering tasks, existing methods for environment configuration often rely on manual efforts or fragile scripts, leading to inefficiencies and unreliable outcomes. We introduce Repo2Run, the first LLM-based agent designed to fully automate environment configuration and generate executable Dockerfiles for arbitrary Python repositories. We address two major challenges: (1) enabling the LLM agent to configure environments within isolated Docker containers, and (2) ensuring the successful configuration process is recorded and accurately transferred to a Dockerfile without error. To achieve this, we propose atomic configuration synthesis, featuring a dual-environment architecture (internal and external environment) with a rollback mechanism to prevent environment "pollution" from failed commands, guaranteeing atomic execution (execute fully or not at all) and a Dockerfile generator to transfer successful configuration steps into runnable Dockerfiles. We evaluate Repo2Run~on our proposed benchmark of 420 recent Python repositories with unit tests, where it achieves an 86.0% success rate, outperforming the best baseline by 63.9%. Repo2Run is available at https://github.com/bytedance/Repo2Run.</description>

      <title>Secure Federated Data Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) is a powerful technique for reducing large datasets into compact, representative synthetic datasets, accelerating Machine Learning training. However, traditional DD methods operate in a centralized manner, which poses significant privacy threats and reduces its applicability. To mitigate these risks, we propose a Secure Federated Data Distillation (SFDD) framework to decentralize the distillation process while preserving privacy. Unlike existing Federated Distillation techniques that focus on training global models with distilled knowledge, our approach aims to produce a distilled dataset without exposing local contributions. We leverage the gradient-matching-based distillation method, adapting it for a distributed setting where clients contribute to the distillation process without sharing raw data. The central aggregator iteratively refines a synthetic dataset by integrating client-side updates while ensuring data confidentiality. To make our approach resilient to inference attacks perpetrated by the server that could exploit gradient updates to reconstruct private data, we create an optimized Local Differential Privacy approach, called LDPO-RLD. Furthermore, we assess the framework's resilience against malicious clients executing backdoor attacks (such as Doorping) and demonstrate robustness under the assumption of a sufficient number of participating clients. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SFDD and that the proposed defense concretely mitigates the identified vulnerabilities, with minimal impact on the performance of the distilled dataset. By addressing the interplay between privacy and federation in dataset distillation, this work advances the field of privacy-preserving Machine Learning making our SFDD framework a viable solution for sensitive data-sharing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated ECG diagnosis has seen significant advancements with deep learning techniques, but real-world applications still face challenges when dealing with scanned paper ECGs. In this study, we explore multi-label classification of ECGs extracted from scanned images, moving beyond traditional binary classification (normal/abnormal). We evaluate the performance of multiple deep neural network architectures, including AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and Vision Transformer, on scanned ECG datasets. Our comparative analysis examines model accuracy, robustness to image artifacts, and generalizability across different ECG conditions. Additionally, we investigate whether ECG signals extracted from scanned images retain sufficient diagnostic information for reliable automated classification. The findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each architecture, providing insights into the feasibility of image-based ECG diagnosis and its potential integration into clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>DEFT: Differentiable Branched Discrete Elastic Rods for Modeling Furcated DLOs in Real-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex branched cables with high precision and reliability. A key challenge in automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched structures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation. A comprehensive series of real-world experiments demonstrates DEFT's efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.

      <title>A generative approach to LLM harmfulness detection with special red flag tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most safety training methods for large language models (LLMs) based on fine-tuning rely on dramatically changing the output distribution of the model when faced with a harmful request, shifting it from an unsafe answer to a refusal to respond. These methods inherently compromise model capabilities and might make auto-regressive models vulnerable to attacks that make likely an initial token of affirmative response. To avoid that, we propose to expand the model's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token (&lt;rf&gt;) and propose to fine-tune the model to generate this token at any time harmful content is generated or about to be generated. This novel safety training method effectively augments LLMs into generative classifiers of harmfulness at all times during the conversation. This method offers several advantages: it enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while marginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's utility. It also evaluates each generated answer rather than just the input prompt and provides a stronger defence against sampling-based attacks. In addition, it simplifies the evaluation of the model's robustness and reduces correlated failures when combined with a classifier. We further show an increased robustness to long contexts, and supervised fine-tuning attacks.</description>

      <title>Iterative Flow Matching -- Path Correction and Gradual Refinement for Enhanced Generative Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models for image generation are now commonly used for a wide variety of applications, ranging from guided image generation for entertainment to solving inverse problems. Nonetheless, training a generator is a non-trivial feat that requires fine-tuning and can lead to so-called hallucinations, that is, the generation of images that are unrealistic. In this work, we explore image generation using flow matching. We explain and demonstrate why flow matching can generate hallucinations, and propose an iterative process to improve the generation process. Our iterative process can be integrated into virtually $\textit{any}$ generative modeling technique, thereby enhancing the performance and robustness of image synthesis systems.</description>

Abstract: Protein-specific large language models (Protein LLMs) are revolutionizing protein science by enabling more efficient protein structure prediction, function annotation, and design. While existing surveys focus on specific aspects or applications, this work provides the first comprehensive overview of Protein LLMs, covering their architectures, training datasets, evaluation metrics, and diverse applications. Through a systematic analysis of over 100 articles, we propose a structured taxonomy of state-of-the-art Protein LLMs, analyze how they leverage large-scale protein sequence data for improved accuracy, and explore their potential in advancing protein engineering and biomedical research. Additionally, we discuss key challenges and future directions, positioning Protein LLMs as essential tools for scientific discovery in protein science.

      <title>METAL: A Multi-Agent Framework for Chart Generation with Test-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chart generation aims to generate code to produce charts satisfying the desired visual properties, e.g., texts, layout, color, and type. It has great potential to empower the automatic professional report generation in financial analysis, research presentation, education, and healthcare. In this work, we build a vision-language model (VLM) based multi-agent framework for effective automatic chart generation. Generating high-quality charts requires both strong visual design skills and precise coding capabilities that embed the desired visual properties into code. Such a complex multi-modal reasoning process is difficult for direct prompting of VLMs. To resolve these challenges, we propose METAL, a multi-agent framework that decomposes the task of chart generation into the iterative collaboration among specialized agents. METAL achieves 5.2% improvement over the current best result in the chart generation task. The METAL framework exhibits the phenomenon of test-time scaling: its performance increases monotonically as the logarithmic computational budget grows from 512 to 8192 tokens. In addition, we find that separating different modalities during the critique process of METAL boosts the self-correction capability of VLMs in the multimodal context.</description>

      <title>A Reverse Mamba Attention Network for Pathological Liver Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present RMA-Mamba, a novel architecture that advances the capabilities of vision state space models through a specialized reverse mamba attention module (RMA). The key innovation lies in RMA-Mamba's ability to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining precise local feature representation through its hierarchical processing pipeline. By integrating Vision Mamba (VMamba)'s efficient sequence modeling with RMA's targeted feature refinement, our architecture achieves superior feature learning across multiple scales. This dual-mechanism approach enables robust handling of complex morphological patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate RMA-Mamba's effectiveness in the challenging domain of pathological liver segmentation (from both CT and MRI), where traditional segmentation approaches often fail due to tissue variations. When evaluated on a newly introduced cirrhotic liver dataset (CirrMRI600+) of T2-weighted MRI scans, RMA-Mamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance with a Dice coefficient of 92.08%, mean IoU of 87.36%, and recall of 92.96%. The architecture's generalizability is further validated on the cancerous liver segmentation from CT scans (LiTS: Liver Tumor Segmentation dataset), yielding a Dice score of 92.9% and mIoU of 88.99%. Our code is available for public: https://github.com/JunZengz/RMAMamba.</description>

      <title>EgoNormia: Benchmarking Physical Social Norm Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human activity is moderated by norms. However, machines are often trained without explicit supervision on norm understanding and reasoning, especially when the norms are grounded in a physical and social context. To improve and evaluate the normative reasoning capability of vision-language models (VLMs), we present EgoNormia $\|\epsilon\|$, consisting of 1,853 ego-centric videos of human interactions, each of which has two related questions evaluating both the prediction and justification of normative actions. The normative actions encompass seven categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline leveraging video sampling, automatic answer generation, filtering, and human validation. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art vision-language models lack robust norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 45% on EgoNormia (versus a human bench of 92%). Our analysis of performance in each dimension highlights the significant risks of safety, privacy, and the lack of collaboration and communication capability when applied to real-world agents. We additionally show that through a retrieval-based generation method, it is possible to use EgoNormia to enhance normative reasoning in VLMs.</description>

      <title>Structured Preference Optimization for Vision-Language Long-Horizon Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for vision-language task planning excel in short-horizon tasks but often fall short in complex, long-horizon planning within dynamic environments. These challenges primarily arise from the difficulty of effectively training models to produce high-quality reasoning processes for long-horizon tasks. To address this, we propose Structured Preference Optimization (SPO), which aims to enhance reasoning and action selection in long-horizon task planning through structured preference evaluation and optimized training strategies. Specifically, SPO introduces: 1) Preference-Based Scoring and Optimization, which systematically evaluates reasoning chains based on task relevance, visual grounding, and historical consistency; and 2) Curriculum-Guided Training, where the model progressively adapts from simple to complex tasks, improving its generalization ability in long-horizon scenarios and enhancing reasoning robustness. To advance research in vision-language long-horizon task planning, we introduce ExtendaBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering 1,509 tasks across VirtualHome and Habitat 2.0, categorized into ultra-short, short, medium, and long tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SPO significantly improves reasoning quality and final decision accuracy, outperforming prior methods on long-horizon tasks and underscoring the effectiveness of preference-driven optimization in vision-language task planning. Specifically, SPO achieves a +5.98% GCR and +4.68% SR improvement in VirtualHome and a +3.30% GCR and +2.11% SR improvement in Habitat over the best-performing baselines.</description>

      <title>UoR-NCL at SemEval-2025 Task 1: Using Generative LLMs and CLIP Models for Multilingual Multimodal Idiomaticity Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SemEval-2025 Task 1 focuses on ranking images based on their alignment with a given nominal compound that may carry idiomatic meaning in both English and Brazilian Portuguese. To address this challenge, this work uses generative large language models (LLMs) and multilingual CLIP models to enhance idiomatic compound representations. LLMs generate idiomatic meanings for potentially idiomatic compounds, enriching their semantic interpretation. These meanings are then encoded using multilingual CLIP models, serving as representations for image ranking. Contrastive learning and data augmentation techniques are applied to fine-tune these embeddings for improved performance. Experimental results show that multimodal representations extracted through this method outperformed those based solely on the original nominal compounds. The fine-tuning approach shows promising outcomes but is less effective than using embeddings without fine-tuning.

      <title>Robust Deterministic Policy Gradient for Disturbance Attenuation and Its Application to Quadrotor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Practical control systems pose significant challenges in identifying optimal control policies due to uncertainties in the system model and external disturbances. While $H_\infty$ control techniques are commonly used to design robust controllers that mitigate the effects of disturbances, these methods often require complex and computationally intensive calculations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm called Robust Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG), which formulates the $H_\infty$ control problem as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game. In this formulation, one player (the user) aims to minimize the cost, while the other player (the adversary) seeks to maximize it. We then employ deterministic policy gradient (DPG) and its deep reinforcement learning counterpart to train a robust control policy with effective disturbance attenuation. In particular, for practical implementation, we introduce an algorithm called robust deep deterministic policy gradient (RDDPG), which employs a deep neural network architecture and integrates techniques from the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to enhance stability and learning efficiency. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we implement it on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasked with following a predefined path in a disturbance-prone environment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other control approaches in terms of robustness against disturbances, enabling precise real-time tracking of moving targets even under severe disturbance conditions.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Effective Reinforcement Learning Method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning diffusion models with black-box objectives. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy optimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose leave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling. Our results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on various black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between computational efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>MedUnifier: Unifying Vision-and-Language Pre-training on Medical Data with Vision Generation Task using Discrete Visual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP), current approaches predominantly emphasize feature extraction and cross-modal comprehension, with limited attention to generating or transforming visual content. This gap hinders the model's ability to synthesize coherent and novel visual representations from textual prompts, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multi-modal learning. In this work, we propose MedUnifier, a unified VLP framework tailored for medical data. MedUnifier seamlessly integrates text-grounded image generation capabilities with multi-modal learning strategies, including image-text contrastive alignment, image-text matching and image-grounded text generation. Unlike traditional methods that reply on continuous visual representations, our approach employs visual vector quantization, which not only facilitates a more cohesive learning strategy for cross-modal understanding but also enhances multi-modal generation quality by effectively leveraging discrete representations. Our framework's effectiveness is evidenced by the experiments on established benchmarks, including uni-modal tasks (supervised fine-tuning), cross-modal tasks (image-text retrieval and zero-shot image classification), and multi-modal tasks (medical report generation, image synthesis), where it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. MedUnifier also offers a highly adaptable tool for a wide range of language and vision tasks in healthcare, marking advancement toward the development of a generalizable AI model for medical applications.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{SEM-CTRL}$: Semantically Controlled Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring both syntactic and semantic correctness in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs remains a significant challenge, despite being critical for real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{SEM-CTRL}$, a unified approach that enforces rich context-sensitive constraints and task- and instance-specific semantics directly on an LLM decoder. Our approach integrates token-level MCTS, which is guided by specific syntactic and semantic constraints. The constraints over the desired outputs are expressed using Answer Set Grammars -- a logic-based formalism that generalizes context-sensitive grammars while incorporating background knowledge to represent task-specific semantics. We show that our approach guarantees correct completions for any off-the-shelf LLM without the need for fine-tuning. We evaluate $\texttt{SEM-CTRL}$ on a range of tasks, including synthetic grammar synthesis, combinatorial reasoning, and planning. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SEM-CTRL}$ allows small pre-trained LLMs to efficiently outperform larger variants and state-of-the-art reasoning models (e.g., o1-preview) while simultaneously guaranteeing solution correctness.</description>

      <title>Union of Experts: Adapting Hierarchical Routing to Equivalently Decomposed Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Union-of-Experts (UoE), which decomposes transformer into an equitant group of experts, and then implement selective routing on input data and experts. Our approach advances MoE design with four key innovations: (1) We conducted equitant expert decomposition on both MLP blocks and attention blocks based on matrix partition in tensor parallelism. (2) We developed two routing paradigms: patch-wise data selection and expert selection, to apply routing across different levels. (3) We design the architecture of UoE model, including Selective Multi-Head Attention (SMHA) and Union-of-MLP-Experts (UoME). (4) We develop parallel implementation of UoE's routing and computation operation, and optimize efficiency based on the hardware processing analysis. The experiments demonstrate that the UoE model surpass Full Attention, state-of-art MoEs and efficient transformers (including the model architecture of recently proposed DeepSeek-V3) in several tasks across image and natural language domains. In language modeling tasks, we achieve an average reduction of 2.38 in perplexity compared to the best-performed MoE method with an average of 76% FLOPs. In Long Range Arena benchmark, we recorded an average score that is at least 0.68% higher than all comparison models including Full Attention, MoEs, and transformer variants, with only 50% FLOPs of the best MoE method. In image classification, our model yielded an average accuracy improvement of 1.75% than the best model while maintaining comparable FLOPs.

      <title>A dataset-free approach for self-supervised learning of 3D reflectional symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a self-supervised model that learns to detect the symmetry of a single object without requiring a dataset-relying solely on the input object itself. We hypothesize that the symmetry of an object can be determined by its intrinsic features, eliminating the need for large datasets during training. Additionally, we design a self-supervised learning strategy that removes the necessity of ground truth labels. These two key elements make our approach both effective and efficient, addressing the prohibitive costs associated with constructing large, labeled datasets for this task. The novelty of our method lies in computing features for each point on the object based on the idea that symmetric points should exhibit similar visual appearances. To achieve this, we leverage features extracted from a foundational image model to compute a visual descriptor for the points. This approach equips the point cloud with visual features that facilitate the optimization of our self-supervised model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art models trained on large datasets. Furthermore, our model is more efficient, effective, and operates with minimal computational and data resources.</description>

      <title>Do Not Trust Licenses You See -- Dataset Compliance Requires Massive-Scale AI-Powered Lifecycle Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that a dataset's legal risk cannot be accurately assessed by its license terms alone; instead, tracking dataset redistribution and its full lifecycle is essential. However, this process is too complex for legal experts to handle manually at scale. Tracking dataset provenance, verifying redistribution rights, and assessing evolving legal risks across multiple stages require a level of precision and efficiency that exceeds human capabilities. Addressing this challenge effectively demands AI agents that can systematically trace dataset redistribution, analyze compliance, and identify legal risks. We develop an automated data compliance system called NEXUS and show that AI can perform these tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness than human experts. Our massive legal analysis of 17,429 unique entities and 8,072 license terms using this approach reveals the discrepancies in legal rights between the original datasets before redistribution and their redistributed subsets, underscoring the necessity of the data lifecycle-aware compliance. For instance, we find that out of 2,852 datasets with commercially viable individual license terms, only 605 (21%) are legally permissible for commercialization. This work sets a new standard for AI data governance, advocating for a framework that systematically examines the entire lifecycle of dataset redistribution to ensure transparent, legal, and responsible dataset management.</description>

      <title>Deepfake-Eval-2024: A Multi-Modal In-the-Wild Benchmark of Deepfakes Circulated in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the age of increasingly realistic generative AI, robust deepfake detection is essential for mitigating fraud and disinformation. While many deepfake detectors report high accuracy on academic datasets, we show that these academic benchmarks are out of date and not representative of real-world deepfakes. We introduce Deepfake-Eval-2024, a new deepfake detection benchmark consisting of in-the-wild deepfakes collected from social media and deepfake detection platform users in 2024. Deepfake-Eval-2024 consists of 45 hours of videos, 56.5 hours of audio, and 1,975 images, encompassing the latest manipulation technologies. The benchmark contains diverse media content from 88 different websites in 52 different languages. We find that the performance of open-source state-of-the-art deepfake detection models drops precipitously when evaluated on Deepfake-Eval-2024, with AUC decreasing by 50\% for video, 48\% for audio, and 45\% for image models compared to previous benchmarks. We also evaluate commercial deepfake detection models and models finetuned on Deepfake-Eval-2024, and find that they have superior performance to off-the-shelf open-source models, but do not yet reach the accuracy of deepfake forensic analysts. The dataset is available at https://github.com/nuriachandra/Deepfake-Eval-2024.</description>

      <title>LINGOLY-TOO: Disentangling Memorisation from Reasoning with Linguistic Templatisation and Orthographic Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is susceptible to overestimation due to data exposure of evaluation benchmarks. We introduce a framework for producing linguistic reasoning problems that reduces the effect of memorisation in model performance estimates and apply this framework to develop LINGOLY-TOO, a challenging benchmark for linguistic reasoning. By developing orthographic templates, we dynamically obfuscate the writing systems of real languages to generate numerousquestion variations. These variations preserve the reasoning steps required for each solution while reducing the likelihood of specific problem instances appearing in model training data. Our experiments demonstrate that frontier models, including Claud 3.7 Sonnet, o1-preview and DeepSeek R1, struggle with advanced reasoning. Our analysis also shows that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance in accuracy across permutations of the same problem, and on average perform better on questions appearing in their original orthography. Our findings highlight the opaque nature of response generation in LLMs and provide evidence that prior data exposure contributes to over estimating the reasoning capabilities of frontier models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DiRe - JAX is a new dimensionality reduction toolkit designed to address some of the challenges faced by traditional methods like UMAP and tSNE such as loss of global structure and computational efficiency. Built on the JAX framework, DiRe leverages modern hardware acceleration to provide an efficient, scalable, and interpretable solution for visualizing complex data structures, and for quantitative analysis of lower-dimensional embeddings. The toolkit shows considerable promise in preserving both local and global structures within the data as compared to state-of-the-art UMAP and tSNE implementations. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications in machine learning, bio-informatics, and data science.</description>

      <title>When Claims Evolve: Evaluating and Enhancing the Robustness of Embedding Models Against Misinformation Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online misinformation remains a critical challenge, and fact-checkers increasingly rely on embedding-based methods to retrieve relevant fact-checks. Yet, when debunked claims reappear in edited forms, the performance of these methods is unclear. In this work, we introduce a taxonomy of six common real-world misinformation edits and propose a perturbation framework that generates valid, natural claim variations. Our multi-stage retrieval evaluation reveals that standard embedding models struggle with user-introduced edits, while LLM-distilled embeddings offer improved robustness at a higher computational cost. Although a strong reranker helps mitigate some issues, it cannot fully compensate for first-stage retrieval gaps. Addressing these retrieval gaps, our train- and inference-time mitigation approaches enhance in-domain robustness by up to 17 percentage points and boost out-of-domain generalization by 10 percentage points over baseline models. Overall, our findings provide practical improvements to claim-matching systems, enabling more reliable fact-checking of evolving misinformation.</description>

      <title>Towards Visual Discrimination and Reasoning of Real-World Physical Dynamics: Physics-Grounded Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans detect real-world object anomalies by perceiving, interacting, and reasoning based on object-conditioned physical knowledge. The long-term goal of Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is to enable machines to autonomously replicate this skill. However, current IAD algorithms are largely developed and tested on static, semantically simple datasets, which diverge from real-world scenarios where physical understanding and reasoning are essential. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Detection (Phys-AD) dataset, the first large-scale, real-world, physics-grounded video dataset for industrial anomaly detection. Collected using a real robot arm and motor, Phys-AD provides a diverse set of dynamic, semantically rich scenarios. The dataset includes more than 6400 videos across 22 real-world object categories, interacting with robot arms and motors, and exhibits 47 types of anomalies. Anomaly detection in Phys-AD requires visual reasoning, combining both physical knowledge and video content to determine object abnormality. We benchmark state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods under three settings: unsupervised AD, weakly-supervised AD, and video-understanding AD, highlighting their limitations in handling physics-grounded anomalies. Additionally, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Explanation (PAEval) metric, designed to assess the ability of visual-language foundation models to not only detect anomalies but also provide accurate explanations for their underlying physical causes. Our dataset and benchmark will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Recommender Systems: Exploring Alternative Recommender Ecosystem Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender ecosystems are an emerging subject of research. Such research examines how the characteristics of algorithms, recommendation consumers, and item providers influence system dynamics and long-term outcomes. One architectural possibility that has not yet been widely explored in this line of research is the consequences of a configuration in which recommendation algorithms are decoupled from the platforms they serve. This is sometimes called "the friendly neighborhood algorithm store" or "middleware" model. We are particularly interested in how such architectures might offer a range of different distributions of utility across consumers, providers, and recommendation platforms. In this paper, we create a model of a recommendation ecosystem that incorporates algorithm choice and examine the outcomes of such a design.</description>
