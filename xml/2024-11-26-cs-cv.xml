      <title>dc-GAN: Dual-Conditioned GAN for Face Demorphing From a Single Morph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A facial morph is an image created by combining two face images pertaining to two distinct identities. Face demorphing inverts the process and tries to recover the original images constituting a facial morph. While morph attack detection (MAD) techniques can be used to flag morph images, they do not divulge any visual information about the faces used to create them. Demorphing helps address this problem. Existing demorphing techniques are either very restrictive (assume identities during testing) or produce feeble outputs (both outputs look very similar). In this paper, we overcome these issues by proposing dc-GAN, a novel GAN-based demorphing method conditioned on the morph images. Our method overcomes morph-replication and produces high quality reconstructions of the bonafide images used to create the morphs. Moreover, our method is highly generalizable across demorphing paradigms (differential/reference-free). We conduct experiments on AMSL, FRLL-Morphs and MorDiff datasets to showcase the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Adaptation of 3D Point Clouds via Denoising Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) of 3D point clouds is crucial for mitigating discrepancies between training and testing samples in real-world scenarios, particularly when handling corrupted point clouds. LiDAR data, for instance, can be affected by sensor failures or environmental factors, causing domain gaps. Adapting models to these distribution shifts online is crucial, as training for every possible variation is impractical. Existing methods often focus on fine-tuning pre-trained models based on self-supervised learning or pseudo-labeling, which can lead to forgetting valuable source domain knowledge over time and reduce generalization on future tests. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D test-time adaptation method, termed 3DD-TTA, which stands for 3D Denoising Diffusion Test-Time Adaptation. This method uses a diffusion strategy that adapts input point cloud samples to the source domain while keeping the source model parameters intact. The approach uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode the corrupted point cloud into a shape latent and latent points. These latent points are corrupted with Gaussian noise and subjected to a denoising diffusion process. During this process, both the shape latent and latent points are updated to preserve fidelity, guiding the denoising toward generating consistent samples that align more closely with the source domain. We conduct extensive experiments on the ShapeNet dataset and investigate its generalizability on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving state-of-the-art results. The code has been released at \url{https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/3DD-TTA}.</description>

      <title>Delta-NAS: Difference of Architecture Encoding for Predictor-based Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) continues to serve a key roll in the design and development of neural networks for task specific deployment. Modern NAS techniques struggle to deal with ever increasing search space complexity and compute cost constraints. Existing approaches can be categorized into two buckets: fine-grained computational expensive NAS and coarse-grained low cost NAS. Our objective is to craft an algorithm with the capability to perform fine-grain NAS at a low cost. We propose projecting the problem to a lower dimensional space through predicting the difference in accuracy of a pair of similar networks. This paradigm shift allows for reducing computational complexity from exponential down to linear with respect to the size of the search space. We present a strong mathematical foundation for our algorithm in addition to extensive experimental results across a host of common NAS Benchmarks. Our methods significantly out performs existing works achieving better performance coupled with a significantly higher sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>U-Motion: Learned Point Cloud Video Compression with U-Structured Motion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud video (PCV) is a versatile 3D representation of dynamic scenes with many emerging applications. This paper introduces U-Motion, a learning-based compression scheme for both PCV geometry and attributes. We propose a U-Structured multiscale inter-frame prediction framework, U-Inter, which performs layer-wise explicit motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC) at different scales with varying levels of detail. It integrates both higher and lower-scale motion features, in addition to the information of current and previous frames, to enable accurate motion estimation at the current scale. In addition, we design a cascaded spatial predictive coding module to capture the inter-scale spatial redundancy remaining after U-Inter prediction. We further propose an effective context detach and restore scheme to reduce spatial-temporal redundancy in the motion and latent bit-streams and improve compression performance. We conduct experiments following the MPEG Common Test Condition and demonstrate that U-Motion can achieve significant gains over MPEG G-PCC-GesTM v3.0 and recently published learning-based methods for both geometry and attribute compression.</description>

      <title>Night-to-Day Translation via Illumination Degradation Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Night-to-Day translation (Night2Day) aims to achieve day-like vision for nighttime scenes. However, processing night images with complex degradations remains a significant challenge under unpaired conditions. Previous methods that uniformly mitigate these degradations have proven inadequate in simultaneously restoring daytime domain information and preserving underlying semantics. In this paper, we propose \textbf{N2D3} (\textbf{N}ight-to-\textbf{D}ay via \textbf{D}egradation \textbf{D}isentanglement) to identify different degradation patterns in nighttime images. Specifically, our method comprises a degradation disentanglement module and a degradation-aware contrastive learning module. Firstly, we extract physical priors from a photometric model based on Kubelka-Munk theory. Then, guided by these physical priors, we design a disentanglement module to discriminate among different illumination degradation regions. Finally, we introduce the degradation-aware contrastive learning strategy to preserve semantic consistency across distinct degradation regions. Our method is evaluated on two public datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement in visual quality and considerable potential for benefiting downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-MR: Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Video Moment Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are widely used for visual perception, understanding, and reasoning. However, long video processing and precise moment retrieval remain challenging due to LLMs' limited context size and coarse frame extraction. We propose the Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Moment Retrieval (LLaVA-MR), which enables accurate moment retrieval and contextual grounding in videos using MLLMs. LLaVA-MR combines Dense Frame and Time Encoding (DFTE) for spatial-temporal feature extraction, Informative Frame Selection (IFS) for capturing brief visual and motion patterns, and Dynamic Token Compression (DTC) to manage LLM context limitations. Evaluations on benchmarks like Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that LLaVA-MR outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 1.82% in R1@0.5 and 1.29% in mAP@0.5 on the QVHighlights dataset. Our implementation will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>NexusSplats: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated remarkable rendering quality and efficiency in 3D scene reconstruction, it struggles with varying lighting conditions and incidental occlusions in real-world scenarios. To accommodate varying lighting conditions, existing 3DGS extensions apply color mapping to the massive Gaussian primitives with individually optimized appearance embeddings. To handle occlusions, they predict pixel-wise uncertainties via 2D image features for occlusion capture. Nevertheless, such massive color mapping and pixel-wise uncertainty prediction strategies suffer from not only additional computational costs but also coarse-grained lighting and occlusion handling. In this work, we propose a nexus kernel-driven approach, termed NexusSplats, for efficient and finer 3D scene reconstruction under complex lighting and occlusion conditions. In particular, NexusSplats leverages a novel light decoupling strategy where appearance embeddings are optimized based on nexus kernels instead of massive Gaussian primitives, thus accelerating reconstruction speeds while ensuring local color consistency for finer textures. Additionally, a Gaussian-wise uncertainty mechanism is developed, aligning 3D structures with 2D image features for fine-grained occlusion handling. Experimental results demonstrate that NexusSplats achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing reconstruction time by up to 70.4% compared to the current best in quality.</description>

      <title>The Double-Ellipsoid Geometry of CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) is highly instrumental in machine learning applications within a large variety of domains. We investigate the geometry of this embedding, which is still not well understood. We examine the raw unnormalized embedding and show that text and image reside on linearly separable ellipsoid shells, not centered at the origin. We explain the benefits of having this structure, allowing to better embed instances according to their uncertainty during contrastive training. Frequent concepts in the dataset yield more false negatives, inducing greater uncertainty. A new notion of conformity is introduced, which measures the average cosine similarity of an instance to any other instance within a representative data set. We show this measure can be accurately estimated by simply computing the cosine similarity to the modality mean vector. Furthermore, we find that CLIP's modality gap optimizes the matching of the conformity distributions of image and text.</description>

      <title>MyTimeMachine: Personalized Facial Age Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial aging is a complex process, highly dependent on multiple factors like gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, etc., making it extremely challenging to learn a global aging prior to predict aging for any individual accurately. Existing techniques often produce realistic and plausible aging results, but the re-aged images often do not resemble the person's appearance at the target age and thus need personalization. In many practical applications of virtual aging, e.g. VFX in movies and TV shows, access to a personal photo collection of the user depicting aging in a small time interval (20$\sim$40 years) is often available. However, naive attempts to personalize global aging techniques on personal photo collections often fail. Thus, we propose MyTimeMachine (MyTM), which combines a global aging prior with a personal photo collection (using as few as 50 images) to learn a personalized age transformation. We introduce a novel Adapter Network that combines personalized aging features with global aging features and generates a re-aged image with StyleGAN2. We also introduce three loss functions to personalize the Adapter Network with personalized aging loss, extrapolation regularization, and adaptive w-norm regularization. Our approach can also be extended to videos, achieving high-quality, identity-preserving, and temporally consistent aging effects that resemble actual appearances at target ages, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>GMAI-VL &amp; GMAI-VL-5.5M: A Large Vision-Language Model and A Comprehensive Multimodal Dataset Towards General Medical AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in general artificial intelligence, such as GPT-4, their effectiveness in the medical domain (general medical AI, GMAI) remains constrained due to the absence of specialized medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we present GMAI-VL-5.5M, a comprehensive multimodal medical dataset created by converting hundreds of specialized medical datasets into meticulously constructed image-text pairs. This dataset features comprehensive task coverage, diverse modalities, and high-quality image-text data. Building upon this multimodal dataset, we propose GMAI-VL, a general medical vision-language model with a progressively three-stage training strategy. This approach significantly enhances the model's ability by integrating visual and textual information, thereby improving its ability to process multimodal data and support accurate diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GMAI-VL achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of multimodal medical tasks, such as visual question answering and medical image diagnosis. Our contributions include the development of the GMAI-VL-5.5M dataset, the introduction of the GMAI-VL model, and the establishment of new benchmarks in multiple medical domains. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/uni-medical/GMAI-VL.</description>

      <title>Enhancing GeoAI and location encoding with spatial point pattern statistics: A Case Study of Terrain Feature Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to terrain feature classification by incorporating spatial point pattern statistics into deep learning models. Inspired by the concept of location encoding, which aims to capture location characteristics to enhance GeoAI decision-making capabilities, we improve the GeoAI model by a knowledge driven approach to integrate both first-order and second-order effects of point patterns. This paper investigates how these spatial contexts impact the accuracy of terrain feature predictions. The results show that incorporating spatial point pattern statistics notably enhances model performance by leveraging different representations of spatial relationships.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm without physical contact. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD for the first time, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</description>

      <title>Solving Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding as Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in a 3D scene with natural language descriptions. Supervised methods have achieved decent accuracy, but have a closed vocabulary and limited language understanding ability. Zero-shot methods mostly utilize large language models (LLMs) to handle natural language descriptions, yet suffer from slow inference speed. To address these problems, in this work, we propose a zero-shot method that reformulates the 3DVG task as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where the variables and constraints represent objects and their spatial relations, respectively. This allows a global reasoning of all relevant objects, producing grounding results of both the target and anchor objects. Moreover, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by handling negation- and counting-based queries with only minor extra coding efforts. Our system, Constraint Satisfaction Visual Grounding (CSVG), has been extensively evaluated on the public datasets ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets using only open-source LLMs. Results show the effectiveness of CSVG and superior grounding accuracy over current state-of-the-art zero-shot 3DVG methods with improvements of $+7.0\%$ (Acc@0.5 score) and $+11.2\%$ on the ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets, respectively. The code of our system is publicly available at https://github.com/sunsleaf/CSVG.</description>

      <title>HotSpot: Screened Poisson Equation for Signed Distance Function Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method, HotSpot, for optimizing neural signed distance functions, based on a relation between the solution of a screened Poisson equation and the distance function. Existing losses such as the eikonal loss cannot guarantee the recovered implicit function to be a distance function, even when the implicit function satisfies the eikonal equation almost everywhere. Furthermore, the eikonal loss suffers from stability issues in optimization and the remedies that introduce area or divergence minimization can lead to oversmoothing. We address these challenges by designing a loss function that when minimized can converge to the true distance function, is stable, and naturally penalize large surface area. We provide theoretical analysis and experiments on both challenging 2D and 3D datasets and show that our method provide better surface reconstruction and more accurate distance approximation.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Adaptation of Diffusion Models via Noisy Aggregated Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce novel methods for adapting diffusion models under differential privacy (DP) constraints, enabling privacy-preserving style and content transfer without fine-tuning. Traditional approaches to private adaptation, such as DP-SGD, incur significant computational overhead and degrade model performance when applied to large, complex models. Our approach instead leverages embedding-based techniques: Universal Guidance and Textual Inversion (TI), adapted with differentially private mechanisms. We apply these methods to Stable Diffusion for style adaptation using two private datasets: a collection of artworks by a single artist and pictograms from the Paris 2024 Olympics. Experimental results show that the TI-based adaptation achieves superior fidelity in style transfer, even under strong privacy guarantees, while both methods maintain high privacy resilience by employing calibrated noise and subsampling strategies. Our findings demonstrate a feasible and efficient pathway for privacy-preserving diffusion model adaptation, balancing data protection with the fidelity of generated images, and offer insights into embedding-driven methods for DP in generative AI applications.</description>

      <title>Whats in a Video: Factorized Autoregressive Decoding for Online Dense Video Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating automatic dense captions for videos that accurately describe their contents remains a challenging area of research. Most current models require processing the entire video at once. Instead, we propose an efficient, online approach which outputs frequent, detailed and temporally aligned captions, without access to future frames. Our model uses a novel autoregressive factorized decoding architecture, which models the sequence of visual features for each time segment, outputting localized descriptions and efficiently leverages the context from the previous video segments. This allows the model to output frequent, detailed captions to more comprehensively describe the video, according to its actual local content, rather than mimic the training data. Second, we propose an optimization for efficient training and inference, which enables scaling to longer videos. Our approach shows excellent performance compared to both offline and online methods, and uses 20\% less compute. The annotations produced are much more comprehensive and frequent, and can further be utilized in automatic video tagging and in large-scale video data harvesting.</description>

      <title>Anti-Forgetting Adaptation for Unsupervised Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (ReID) focuses on adapting a model from a source domain to a fixed target domain. However, an adapted ReID model can hardly retain previously-acquired knowledge and generalize to unseen data. In this paper, we propose a Dual-level Joint Adaptation and Anti-forgetting (DJAA) framework, which incrementally adapts a model to new domains without forgetting source domain and each adapted target domain. We explore the possibility of using prototype and instance-level consistency to mitigate the forgetting during the adaptation. Specifically, we store a small number of representative image samples and corresponding cluster prototypes in a memory buffer, which is updated at each adaptation step. With the buffered images and prototypes, we regularize the image-to-image similarity and image-to-prototype similarity to rehearse old knowledge. After the multi-step adaptation, the model is tested on all seen domains and several unseen domains to validate the generalization ability of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the anti-forgetting, generalization and backward-compatible ability of an unsupervised person ReID model.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Pre-Aligned Method with Global and Local Information for Remote-Sensing Image and Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing cross-modal text-image retrieval (RSCTIR) has gained attention for its utility in information mining. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating global and local information due to variations in remote sensing imagery and ensuring proper feature pre-alignment before modal fusion, which affects retrieval accuracy and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose CMPAGL, a cross-modal pre-aligned method leveraging global and local information. Our Gswin transformer block combines local window self-attention and global-local window cross-attention to capture multi-scale features. A pre-alignment mechanism simplifies modal fusion training, improving retrieval performance. Additionally, we introduce a similarity matrix reweighting (SMR) algorithm for reranking, and enhance the triplet loss function with an intra-class distance term to optimize feature learning. Experiments on four datasets, including RSICD and RSITMD, validate CMPAGL's effectiveness, achieving up to 4.65% improvement in R@1 and 2.28% in mean Recall (mR) over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Any-to-3D Generation via Hybrid Diffusion Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in 3D object generation has been fueled by the strong priors offered by diffusion models. However, existing models are tailored to specific tasks, accommodating only one modality at a time and necessitating retraining to change modalities. Given an image-to-3D model and a text prompt, a naive approach is to convert text prompts to images and then use the image-to-3D model for generation. This approach is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, resulting in unavoidable information loss during modality conversion. To address this, we introduce XBind, a unified framework for any-to-3D generation using cross-modal pre-alignment techniques. XBind integrates an multimodal-aligned encoder with pre-trained diffusion models to generate 3D objects from any modalities, including text, images, and audio. We subsequently present a novel loss function, termed Modality Similarity (MS) Loss, which aligns the embeddings of the modality prompts and the rendered images, facilitating improved alignment of the 3D objects with multiple modalities. Additionally, Hybrid Diffusion Supervision combined with a Three-Phase Optimization process improves the quality of the generated 3D objects. Extensive experiments showcase XBind's broad generation capabilities in any-to-3D scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first method to generate 3D objects from any modality prompts.

      <title>VisionPAD: A Vision-Centric Pre-training Paradigm for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces VisionPAD, a novel self-supervised pre-training paradigm designed for vision-centric algorithms in autonomous driving. In contrast to previous approaches that employ neural rendering with explicit depth supervision, VisionPAD utilizes more efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct multi-view representations using only images as supervision. Specifically, we introduce a self-supervised method for voxel velocity estimation. By warping voxels to adjacent frames and supervising the rendered outputs, the model effectively learns motion cues in the sequential data. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-frame photometric consistency approach to enhance geometric perception. It projects adjacent frames to the current frame based on rendered depths and relative poses, boosting the 3D geometric representation through pure image supervision. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that VisionPAD significantly improves performance in 3D object detection, occupancy prediction and map segmentation, surpassing state-of-the-art pre-training strategies by a considerable margin.</description>

      <title>Effective SAM Combination for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign pixel-level labels to images across an unlimited range of classes. Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness across challenging conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Advancing Multimodal Large Language Models in Ability Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance rapidly, rigorous evaluation has become essential, providing further guidance for their development. In this work, we focus on a unified and robust evaluation of \textbf{vision perception} abilities, the foundational skill of MLLMs. We find that existing perception benchmarks, each focusing on different question types, domains, and evaluation metrics, introduce significant evaluation variance, complicating comprehensive assessments of perception abilities when relying on any single benchmark. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AbilityLens}, a unified benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across six key perception abilities, focusing on both accuracy and stability, with each ability encompassing diverse question types, domains, and metrics. With the assistance of AbilityLens, we: (1) identify the strengths and weaknesses of current models, highlighting stability patterns and revealing a notable performance gap between open-source and closed-source models; (2) introduce an online evaluation mode, which uncovers interesting ability conflict and early convergence phenomena during MLLM training; and (3) design a simple ability-specific model merging method that combines the best ability checkpoint from early training stages, effectively mitigating performance decline due to ability conflict. The benchmark and online leaderboard will be released soon.</description>

      <title>AI Tailoring: Evaluating Influence of Image Features on Fashion Product Popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying key product features that influence consumer preferences is essential in the fashion industry. In this study, we introduce a robust methodology to ascertain the most impactful features in fashion product images, utilizing past market sales data. First, we propose the metric called "influence score" to quantitatively assess the importance of product features. Then we develop a forecasting model, the Fashion Demand Predictor (FDP), which integrates Transformer-based models and Random Forest to predict market popularity based on product images. We employ image-editing diffusion models to modify these images and perform an ablation study, which validates the impact of the highest and lowest-scoring features on the model's popularity predictions. Additionally, we further validate these results through surveys that gather human rankings of preferences, confirming the accuracy of the FDP model's predictions and the efficacy of our method in identifying influential features. Notably, products enhanced with "good" features show marked improvements in predicted popularity over their modified counterparts. Our approach develops a fully automated and systematic framework for fashion image analysis that provides valuable guidance for downstream tasks such as fashion product design and marketing strategy development.</description>

      <title>TEXGen: a Generative Diffusion Model for Mesh Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While high-quality texture maps are essential for realistic 3D asset rendering, few studies have explored learning directly in the texture space, especially on large-scale datasets. In this work, we depart from the conventional approach of relying on pre-trained 2D diffusion models for test-time optimization of 3D textures. Instead, we focus on the fundamental problem of learning in the UV texture space itself. For the first time, we train a large diffusion model capable of directly generating high-resolution texture maps in a feed-forward manner. To facilitate efficient learning in high-resolution UV spaces, we propose a scalable network architecture that interleaves convolutions on UV maps with attention layers on point clouds. Leveraging this architectural design, we train a 700 million parameter diffusion model that can generate UV texture maps guided by text prompts and single-view images. Once trained, our model naturally supports various extended applications, including text-guided texture inpainting, sparse-view texture completion, and text-driven texture synthesis.

      <title>FOCUS: Knowledge-enhanced Adaptive Visual Compression for Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning presents a critical solution for cancer diagnosis in computational pathology (CPath), addressing fundamental limitations in data availability, particularly the scarcity of expert annotations and patient privacy constraints. A key challenge in this paradigm stems from the inherent disparity between the limited training set of whole slide images (WSIs) and the enormous number of contained patches, where a significant portion of these patches lacks diagnostically relevant information, potentially diluting the model's ability to learn and focus on critical diagnostic features. While recent works attempt to address this by incorporating additional knowledge, several crucial gaps hinder further progress: (1) despite the emergence of powerful pathology foundation models (FMs), their potential remains largely untapped, with most approaches limiting their use to basic feature extraction; (2) current language guidance mechanisms attempt to align text prompts with vast numbers of WSI patches all at once, struggling to leverage rich pathological semantic information. To this end, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced adaptive visual compression framework, dubbed FOCUS, which uniquely combines pathology FMs with language prior knowledge to enable a focused analysis of diagnostically relevant regions by prioritizing discriminative WSI patches. Our approach implements a progressive three-stage compression strategy: we first leverage FMs for global visual redundancy elimination, and integrate compressed features with language prompts for semantic relevance assessment, then perform neighbor-aware visual token filtering while preserving spatial coherence. Extensive experiments on pathological datasets spanning breast, lung, and ovarian cancers demonstrate its superior performance in few-shot pathology diagnosis. Code will be made available at https://github.com/dddavid4real/FOCUS.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Understanding via Attention-Driven Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Transformer-based models have advanced point cloud understanding by leveraging self-attention mechanisms, however, these methods often overlook latent information in less prominent regions, leading to increased sensitivity to perturbations and limited global comprehension. To solve this issue, we introduce PointACL, an attention-driven contrastive learning framework designed to address these limitations. Our method employs an attention-driven dynamic masking strategy that guides the model to focus on under-attended regions, enhancing the understanding of global structures within the point cloud. Then we combine the original pre-training loss with a contrastive learning loss, improving feature discrimination and generalization. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PointACL, as it achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of 3D understanding tasks, including object classification, part segmentation, and few-shot learning. Specifically, when integrated with different Transformer backbones like Point-MAE and PointGPT, PointACL demonstrates improved performance on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart. This highlights its superior capability in capturing both global and local features, as well as its enhanced robustness against perturbations and incomplete data.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Multiple-instance Learning for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Estimation with Selective Aggregated Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patient-level diagnosis of severity in ulcerative colitis (UC) is common in real clinical settings, where the most severe score in a patient is recorded. However, previous UC classification methods (i.e., image-level estimation) mainly assumed the input was a single image. Thus, these methods can not utilize severity labels recorded in real clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a patient-level severity estimation method by a transformer with selective aggregator tokens, where a severity label is estimated from multiple images taken from a patient, similar to a clinical setting. Our method can effectively aggregate features of severe parts from a set of images captured in each patient, and it facilitates improving the discriminative ability between adjacent severity classes. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two datasets compared with the state-of-the-art MIL methods. Moreover, we evaluated our method in real clinical settings and confirmed that our method outperformed the previous image-level methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shiku-Kaito/Ordinal-Multiple-instance-Learning-for-Ulcerative-Colitis-Severity-Estimation.</description>

      <title>TopoSD: Topology-Enhanced Lane Segment Perception with SDMap Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving systems have shifted towards reducing reliance on high-definition maps (HDMaps) due to the huge costs of annotation and maintenance. Instead, researchers are focusing on online vectorized HDMap construction using on-board sensors. However, sensor-only approaches still face challenges in long-range perception due to the restricted views imposed by the mounting angles of onboard cameras, just as human drivers also rely on bird's-eye-view navigation maps for a comprehensive understanding of road structures. To address these issues, we propose to train the perception model to "see" standard definition maps (SDMaps). We encode SDMap elements into neural spatial map representations and instance tokens, and then incorporate such complementary features as prior information to improve the bird's eye view (BEV) feature for lane geometry and topology decoding. Based on the lane segment representation framework, the model simultaneously predicts lanes, centrelines and their topology. To further enhance the ability of geometry prediction and topology reasoning, we also use a topology-guided decoder to refine the predictions by exploiting the mutual relationships between topological and geometric features. We perform extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 datasets to validate the proposed method. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, with gains of +6.7 and +9.1 on the mAP and topology metrics. Our analysis also reveals that models trained with SDMap noise augmentation exhibit enhanced robustness.</description>

Abstract: The high-quality, realistic images generated by generative models pose significant challenges for exposing them.So far, data-driven deep neural networks have been justified as the most efficient forensics tools for the challenges. However, they may be over-fitted to certain semantics, resulting in considerable inconsistency in detection performance across different contents of generated samples. It could be regarded as an issue of detection fairness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Fairadapter to tackle the issue. In comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods, our model achieves improved fairness performance. Our project: https://github.com/AppleDogDog/FairnessDetection</description>

      <title>Efficient Long Video Tokenization via Coordinated-based Patch Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient tokenization of videos remains a challenge in training vision models that can process long videos. One promising direction is to develop a tokenizer that can encode long video clips, as it would enable the tokenizer to leverage the temporal coherence of videos better for tokenization. However, training existing tokenizers on long videos often incurs a huge training cost as they are trained to reconstruct all the frames at once. In this paper, we introduce CoordTok, a video tokenizer that learns a mapping from coordinate-based representations to the corresponding patches of input videos, inspired by recent advances in 3D generative models. In particular, CoordTok encodes a video into factorized triplane representations and reconstructs patches that correspond to randomly sampled $(x,y,t)$ coordinates. This allows for training large tokenizer models directly on long videos without requiring excessive training resources. Our experiments show that CoordTok can drastically reduce the number of tokens for encoding long video clips. For instance, CoordTok can encode a 128-frame video with 128$\times$128 resolution into 1280 tokens, while baselines need 6144 or 8192 tokens to achieve similar reconstruction quality. We further show that this efficient video tokenization enables memory-efficient training of a diffusion transformer that can generate 128 frames at once.</description>

      <title>Resolution-Agnostic Transformer-based Climate Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding future weather changes at regional and local scales is crucial for planning and decision-making, particularly in the context of extreme weather events, as well as for broader applications in agriculture, insurance, and infrastructure development. However, the computational cost of downscaling Global Climate Models (GCMs) to the fine resolutions needed for such applications presents a significant barrier. Drawing on advancements in weather forecasting models, this study introduces a cost-efficient downscaling method using a pretrained Earth Vision Transformer (Earth ViT) model. Initially trained on ERA5 data to downscale from 50 km to 25 km resolution, the model is then tested on the higher resolution BARRA-SY dataset at a 3 km resolution. Remarkably, it performs well without additional training, demonstrating its ability to generalize across different resolutions. This approach holds promise for generating large ensembles of regional climate simulations by downscaling GCMs with varying input resolutions without incurring additional training costs. Ultimately, this method could provide more comprehensive estimates of potential future changes in key climate variables, aiding in effective planning for extreme weather events and climate change adaptation strategies.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Semantic Controllability and Diversity for Remote Sensing Image Synthesis with Hybrid Semantic Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant advancements have been made in semantic image synthesis in remote sensing. However, existing methods still face formidable challenges in balancing semantic controllability and diversity. In this paper, we present a Hybrid Semantic Embedding Guided Generative Adversarial Network (HySEGGAN) for controllable and efficient remote sensing image synthesis. Specifically, HySEGGAN leverages hierarchical information from a single source. Motivated by feature description, we propose a hybrid semantic Embedding method, that coordinates fine-grained local semantic layouts to characterize the geometric structure of remote sensing objects without extra information. Besides, a Semantic Refinement Network (SRN) is introduced, incorporating a novel loss function to ensure fine-grained semantic feedback. The proposed approach mitigates semantic confusion and prevents geometric pattern collapse. Experimental results indicate that the method strikes an excellent balance between semantic controllability and diversity. Furthermore, HySEGGAN significantly improves the quality of synthesized images and achieves state-of-the-art performance as a data augmentation technique across multiple datasets for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Style-Friendly SNR Sampler for Style-Driven Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large-scale diffusion models generate high-quality images but struggle to learn new, personalized artistic styles, which limits the creation of unique style templates. Fine-tuning with reference images is the most promising approach, but it often blindly utilizes objectives and noise level distributions used for pre-training, leading to suboptimal style alignment. We propose the Style-friendly SNR sampler, which aggressively shifts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution toward higher noise levels during fine-tuning to focus on noise levels where stylistic features emerge. This enables models to better capture unique styles and generate images with higher style alignment. Our method allows diffusion models to learn and share new "style templates", enhancing personalized content creation. We demonstrate the ability to generate styles such as personal watercolor paintings, minimal flat cartoons, 3D renderings, multi-panel images, and memes with text, thereby broadening the scope of style-driven generation.</description>

      <title>VideoEspresso: A Large-Scale Chain-of-Thought Dataset for Fine-Grained Video Reasoning via Core Frame Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has significantly improved multimodal understanding, yet challenges remain in video reasoning tasks due to the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale datasets. Existing video question-answering (VideoQA) datasets often rely on costly manual annotations with insufficient granularity or automatic construction methods with redundant frame-by-frame analysis, limiting their scalability and effectiveness for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoEspresso, a novel dataset that features VideoQA pairs preserving essential spatial details and temporal coherence, along with multimodal annotations of intermediate reasoning steps. Our construction pipeline employs a semantic-aware method to reduce redundancy, followed by generating QA pairs using GPT-4o. We further develop video Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations to enrich reasoning processes, guiding GPT-4o in extracting logical relationships from QA pairs and video content. To exploit the potential of high-quality VideoQA pairs, we propose a Hybrid LVLMs Collaboration framework, featuring a Frame Selector and a two-stage instruction fine-tuned reasoning LVLM. This framework adaptively selects core frames and performs CoT reasoning using multimodal evidence. Evaluated on our proposed benchmark with 14 tasks against 9 popular LVLMs, our method outperforms existing baselines on most tasks, demonstrating superior video reasoning capabilities. Our code and dataset will be released at: https://github.com/hshjerry/VideoEspresso</description>

      <title>Adaptive Hyper-Graph Convolution Network for Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition with Virtual Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shared topology of human skeletons motivated the recent investigation of graph convolutional network (GCN) solutions for action recognition. However, the existing GCNs rely on the binary connection of two neighbouring vertices (joints) formed by an edge (bone), overlooking the potential of constructing multi-vertex convolution structures. In this paper we address this oversight and explore the merits of a hyper-graph convolutional network (Hyper-GCN) to achieve the aggregation of rich semantic information conveyed by skeleton vertices. In particular, our Hyper-GCN adaptively optimises multi-scale hyper-graphs during training, revealing the action-driven multi-vertex relations. Besides, virtual connections are often designed to support efficient feature aggregation, implicitly extending the spectrum of dependencies within the skeleton. By injecting virtual connections into hyper-graphs, the semantic clues of diverse action categories can be highlighted. The results of experiments conducted on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and NW-UCLA datasets, demonstrate the merits of our Hyper-GCN, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we outperform the existing solutions on NTU-120, achieving 90.2\% and 91.4\% in terms of the top-1 recognition accuracy on X-Sub and X-Set.</description>

      <title>Facial Features Matter: a Dynamic Watermark based Proactive Deepfake Detection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current passive deepfake face-swapping detection methods encounter significance bottlenecks in model generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, proactive detection methods often use fixed watermarks which lack a close relationship with the content they protect and are vulnerable to security risks. Dynamic watermarks based on facial features offer a promising solution, as these features provide unique identifiers. Therefore, this paper proposes a Facial Feature-based Proactive deepfake detection method (FaceProtect), which utilizes changes in facial characteristics during deepfake manipulation as a novel detection mechanism. We introduce a GAN-based One-way Dynamic Watermark Generating Mechanism (GODWGM) that uses 128-dimensional facial feature vectors as inputs. This method creates irreversible mappings from facial features to watermarks, enhancing protection against various reverse inference attacks. Additionally, we propose a Watermark-based Verification Strategy (WVS) that combines steganography with GODWGM, allowing simultaneous transmission of the benchmark watermark representing facial features within the image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method maintains exceptional detection performance and exhibits high practicality on images altered by various deepfake techniques.</description>

      <title>Harlequin: Color-driven Generation of Synthetic Data for Referring Expression Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to identify a particular object in a scene by a natural language expression, and is an important topic in visual language understanding. State-of-the-art methods for this task are based on deep learning, which generally requires expensive and manually labeled annotations. Some works tackle the problem with limited-supervision learning or relying on Large Vision and Language Models. However, the development of techniques to synthesize labeled data is overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that generates artificial data for the REC task, taking into account both textual and visual modalities. At first, our pipeline processes existing data to create variations in the annotations. Then, it generates an image using altered annotations as guidance. The result of this pipeline is a new dataset, called Harlequin, made by more than 1M queries. This approach eliminates manual data collection and annotation, enabling scalability and facilitating arbitrary complexity. We pre-train three REC models on Harlequin, then fine-tuned and evaluated on human-annotated datasets. Our experiments show that the pre-training on artificial data is beneficial for performance.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Image Synthesis via Next-Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (D-JEPA), an autoregressive model, has demonstrated outstanding performance in class-conditional image generation. However, the application of next-token prediction in high-resolution text-to-image generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce D-JEPA$\cdot$T2I, an extension of D-JEPA incorporating flow matching loss, designed to enable data-efficient continuous resolution learning. D-JEPA$\cdot$T2I leverages a multimodal visual transformer to effectively integrate textual and visual features and adopts Visual Rotary Positional Embedding (VoPE) to facilitate continuous resolution learning. Furthermore, we devise a data feedback mechanism that significantly enhances data utilization efficiency. For the first time, we achieve state-of-the-art \textbf{high-resolution} image synthesis via next-token prediction.

      <title>Fine-Grained Alignment in Vision-and-Language Navigation through Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fine-grained alignment in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, where robots navigate realistic 3D environments based on natural language instructions. Current approaches use contrastive learning to align language with visual trajectory sequences. Nevertheless, they encounter difficulties with fine-grained vision negatives. To enhance cross-modal embeddings, we introduce a novel Bayesian Optimization-based adversarial optimization framework for creating fine-grained contrastive vision samples. To validate the proposed methodology, we conduct a series of experiments to assess the effectiveness of the enriched embeddings on fine-grained vision negatives. We conduct experiments on two common VLN benchmarks R2R and REVERIE, experiments on the them demonstrate that these embeddings benefit navigation, and can lead to a promising performance enhancement. Our source code and trained models are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FGVLN.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Multi-view UAV Image Geo-localization via Iterative Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) presents significant challenges due to the view discrepancy between oblique UAV images and overhead satellite images. Existing methods heavily rely on the supervision of labeled datasets to extract viewpoint-invariant features for cross-view retrieval. However, these methods have expensive training costs and tend to overfit the region-specific cues, showing limited generalizability to new regions. To overcome this issue, we propose an unsupervised solution that lifts the scene representation to 3d space from UAV observations for satellite image generation, providing robust representation against view distortion. By generating orthogonal images that closely resemble satellite views, our method reduces view discrepancies in feature representation and mitigates shortcuts in region-specific image pairing. To further align the rendered image's perspective with the real one, we design an iterative camera pose updating mechanism that progressively modulates the rendered query image with potential satellite targets, eliminating spatial offsets relative to the reference images. Additionally, this iterative refinement strategy enhances cross-view feature invariance through view-consistent fusion across iterations. As such, our unsupervised paradigm naturally avoids the problem of region-specific overfitting, enabling generic CVGL for UAV images without feature fine-tuning or data-driven training. Experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves geo-localization accuracy while maintaining robustness across diverse regions. Notably, without model fine-tuning or paired training, our method achieves competitive performance with recent supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Omni-IML: Towards Unified Image Manipulation Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image manipulation can lead to misinterpretation of visual content, posing significant risks to information security. Image Manipulation Localization (IML) has thus received increasing attention. However, existing IML methods rely heavily on task-specific designs, making them perform well only on one target image type but are mostly random guessing on other image types, and even joint training on multiple image types causes significant performance degradation. This hinders the deployment for real applications as it notably increases maintenance costs and the misclassification of image types leads to serious error accumulation. To this end, we propose Omni-IML, the first generalist model to unify diverse IML tasks. Specifically, Omni-IML achieves generalism by adopting the Modal Gate Encoder and the Dynamic Weight Decoder to adaptively determine the optimal encoding modality and the optimal decoder filters for each sample. We additionally propose an Anomaly Enhancement module that enhances the features of tampered regions with box supervision and helps the generalist model to extract common features across different IML tasks. We validate our approach on IML tasks across three major scenarios: natural images, document images, and face images. Without bells and whistles, our Omni-IML achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three tasks with a single unified model, providing valuable strategies and insights for real-world application and future research in generalist image forensics. Our code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Physically Interpretable Probabilistic Domain Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing domains is essential for models analyzing dynamic environments, as it allows them to adapt to evolving conditions or to hand the task over to backup systems when facing conditions outside their operational domain. Existing solutions typically characterize a domain by solving a regression or classification problem, which limits their applicability as they only provide a limited summarized description of the domain. In this paper, we present a novel approach to domain characterization by characterizing domains as probability distributions. Particularly, we develop a method to predict the likelihood of different weather conditions from images captured by vehicle-mounted cameras by estimating distributions of physical parameters using normalizing flows. To validate our proposed approach, we conduct experiments within the context of autonomous vehicles, focusing on predicting the distribution of weather parameters to characterize the operational domain. This domain is characterized by physical parameters (absolute characterization) and arbitrarily predefined domains (relative characterization). Finally, we evaluate whether a system can safely operate in a target domain by comparing it to multiple source domains where safety has already been established. This approach holds significant potential, as accurate weather prediction and effective domain adaptation are crucial for autonomous systems to adjust to dynamic environmental conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has shown immense potential. These models are increasingly capable of tackling abstract visual tasks. Geometric structures, particularly graphs with their inherent flexibility and complexity, serve as an excellent benchmark for evaluating these models' predictive capabilities. While human observers can readily identify subtle visual details and perform accurate analyses, our investigation reveals that state-of-the-art LVLMs exhibit consistent limitations in specific visual graph scenarios, especially when confronted with stylistic variations. In response to these challenges, we introduce VisGraphVar (Visual Graph Variability), a customizable benchmark generator able to produce graph images for seven distinct task categories (detection, classification, segmentation, pattern recognition, link prediction, reasoning, matching), designed to systematically evaluate the strengths and limitations of individual LVLMs. We use VisGraphVar to produce 990 graph images and evaluate six LVLMs, employing two distinct prompting strategies, namely zero-shot and chain-of-thought. The findings demonstrate that variations in visual attributes of images (e.g., node labeling and layout) and the deliberate inclusion of visual imperfections, such as overlapping nodes, significantly affect model performance. This research emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive evaluation across graph-related tasks, extending beyond reasoning alone. VisGraphVar offers valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable and robust systems capable of performing advanced visual graph analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamics-Aware Gaussian Splatting Streaming Towards Fast On-the-Fly Training for 4D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has led to great interest in 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction from multi-view visual inputs. While existing approaches mainly rely on processing full-length multi-view videos for 4D reconstruction, there has been limited exploration of iterative online reconstruction methods that enable on-the-fly training and per-frame streaming. Current 3DGS-based streaming methods treat the Gaussian primitives uniformly and constantly renew the densified Gaussians, thereby overlooking the difference between dynamic and static features and also neglecting the temporal continuity in the scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage pipeline for iterative streamable 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Our pipeline comprises a selective inheritance stage to preserve temporal continuity, a dynamics-aware shift stage for distinguishing dynamic and static primitives and optimizing their movements, and an error-guided densification stage to accommodate emerging objects. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in online 4D reconstruction, demonstrating a 20% improvement in on-the-fly training speed, superior representation quality, and real-time rendering capability.

      <title>Latent Schrodinger Bridge: Prompting Latent Diffusion for Fast Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), which enable both image generation from noise and inversion from data, have inspired powerful unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation algorithms. However, they often require a larger number of neural function evaluations (NFEs), limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we tackle this problem with Schrodinger Bridges (SBs), which are stochastic differential equations (SDEs) between distributions with minimal transport cost. We analyze the probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) formulation of SBs, and observe that we can decompose its vector field into a linear combination of source predictor, target predictor, and noise predictor. Inspired by this observation, we propose Latent Schrodinger Bridges (LSBs) that approximate the SB ODE via pre-trained Stable Diffusion, and develop appropriate prompt optimization and change of variables formula to match the training and inference between distributions. We demonstrate that our algorithm successfully conduct competitive I2I translation in unsupervised setting with only a fraction of computation cost required by previous DM-based I2I methods.</description>

      <title>Defective Edge Detection Using Cascaded Ensemble Canny Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge detection has been one of the most difficult challenges in computer vision because of the difficulty in identifying the borders and edges from the real-world images including objects of varying kinds and sizes. Methods based on ensemble learning, which use a combination of backbones and attention modules, outperformed more conventional approaches, such as Sobel and Canny edge detection. Nevertheless, these algorithms are still challenged when faced with complicated scene photos. In addition, the identified edges utilizing the current methods are not refined and often include incorrect edges. In this work, we used a Cascaded Ensemble Canny operator to solve these problems and detect the object edges. The most difficult Fresh and Rotten and Berkeley datasets are used to test the suggested approach in Python. In terms of performance metrics and output picture quality, the acquired results outperform the specified edge detection networks</description>

      <title>BIP3D: Bridging 2D Images and 3D Perception for Embodied Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In embodied intelligence systems, a key component is 3D perception algorithm, which enables agents to understand their surrounding environments. Previous algorithms primarily rely on point cloud, which, despite offering precise geometric information, still constrain perception performance due to inherent sparsity, noise, and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce a novel image-centric 3D perception model, BIP3D, which leverages expressive image features with explicit 3D position encoding to overcome the limitations of point-centric methods. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained 2D vision foundation models to enhance semantic understanding, and introduce a spatial enhancer module to improve spatial understanding. Together, these modules enable BIP3D to achieve multi-view, multi-modal feature fusion and end-to-end 3D perception. In our experiments, BIP3D outperforms current state-of-the-art results on the EmbodiedScan benchmark, achieving improvements of 5.69% in the 3D detection task and 15.25% in the 3D visual grounding task.</description>

      <title>Prioritize Denoising Steps on Diffusion Model Preference Alignment via Explicit Denoised Distribution Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image generation, making alignment methods for these models increasingly important. A key challenge is the sparsity of preference labels, which are typically available only at the terminal of denoising trajectories. This raises the issue of how to assign credit across denoising steps based on these sparse labels. In this paper, we propose Denoised Distribution Estimation (DDE), a novel method for credit assignment. Unlike previous approaches that rely on auxiliary models or hand-crafted schemes, DDE derives its strategy more explicitly. The proposed DDE directly estimates the terminal denoised distribution from the perspective of each step. It is equipped with two estimation strategies and capable of representing the entire denoising trajectory with a single model inference. Theoretically and empirically, we show that DDE prioritizes optimizing the middle part of the denoising trajectory, resulting in a novel and effective credit assignment scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Boundless Across Domains: A New Paradigm of Adaptive Feature and Cross-Attention for Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-invariant representation learning is a powerful method for domain generalization. Previous approaches face challenges such as high computational demands, training instability, and limited effectiveness with high-dimensional data, potentially leading to the loss of valuable features. To address these issues, we hypothesize that an ideal generalized representation should exhibit similar pattern responses within the same channel across cross-domain images. Based on this hypothesis, we use deep features from the source domain as queries, and deep features from the generated domain as keys and values. Through a cross-channel attention mechanism, the original deep features are reconstructed into robust regularization representations, forming an explicit constraint that guides the model to learn domain-invariant representations. Additionally, style augmentation is another common method. However, existing methods typically generate new styles through convex combinations of source domains, which limits the diversity of training samples by confining the generated styles to the original distribution. To overcome this limitation, we propose an Adaptive Feature Blending (AFB) method that generates out-of-distribution samples while exploring the in-distribution space, significantly expanding the domain range. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve superior performance on two standard domain generalization benchmarks for medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>ReVisionLLM: Recursive Vision-Language Model for Temporal Grounding in Hour-Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at retrieving information from lengthy text, but their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) face difficulties with hour-long videos, especially for temporal grounding. Specifically, these VLMs are constrained by frame limitations, often losing essential temporal details needed for accurate event localization in extended video content. We propose ReVisionLLM, a recursive vision-language model designed to locate events in hour-long videos. Inspired by human search strategies, our model initially targets broad segments of interest, progressively revising its focus to pinpoint exact temporal boundaries. Our model can seamlessly handle videos of vastly different lengths, from minutes to hours. We also introduce a hierarchical training strategy that starts with short clips to capture distinct events and progressively extends to longer videos. To our knowledge, ReVisionLLM is the first VLM capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets by a significant margin (+2.6% R1@0.1 on MAD). The code is available at https://github.com/Tanveer81/ReVisionLLM.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-based End-to-end Temporal Perception for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal perception, the ability to detect and track objects over time, is critical in autonomous driving for maintaining a comprehensive understanding of dynamic environments. However, this task is hindered by significant challenges, including incomplete perception caused by occluded objects and observational blind spots, which are common in single-vehicle perception systems. To address these issues, we introduce LET-VIC, a LiDAR-based End-to-End Tracking framework for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation (VIC). LET-VIC leverages Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to enhance temporal perception by fusing spatial and temporal data from both vehicle and infrastructure sensors. First, it spatially integrates Bird's Eye View (BEV) features from vehicle-side and infrastructure-side LiDAR data, creating a comprehensive view that mitigates occlusions and compensates for blind spots. Second, LET-VIC incorporates temporal context across frames, allowing the model to leverage historical data for enhanced tracking stability and accuracy. To further improve robustness, LET-VIC includes a Calibration Error Compensation (CEC) module to address sensor misalignments and ensure precise feature alignment. Experiments on the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that LET-VIC significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving at least a 13.7% improvement in mAP and a 13.1% improvement in AMOTA without considering communication delays. This work offers a practical solution and a new research direction for advancing temporal perception in autonomous driving through vehicle-infrastructure cooperation.</description>

      <title>Reliable Evaluation of Attribution Maps in CNNs: A Perturbation-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for evaluating attribution maps, which play a central role in interpreting the predictions of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We show that the widely used insertion/deletion metrics are susceptible to distribution shifts that affect the reliability of the ranking. Our method proposes to replace pixel modifications with adversarial perturbations, which provides a more robust evaluation framework. By using smoothness and monotonicity measures, we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in correcting distribution shifts. In addition, we conduct the most comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessment of attribution maps to date. Introducing baseline attribution maps as sanity checks, we find that our metric is the only contender to pass all checks. Using Kendall's $\tau$ rank correlation coefficient, we show the increased consistency of our metric across 15 dataset-architecture combinations. Of the 16 attribution maps tested, our results clearly show SmoothGrad to be the best map currently available. This research makes an important contribution to the development of attribution maps by providing a reliable and consistent evaluation framework. To ensure reproducibility, we will provide the code along with our results.</description>

      <title>Morph: A Motion-free Physics Optimization Framework for Human Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion generation plays a vital role in applications such as digital humans and humanoid robot control. However, most existing approaches disregard physics constraints, leading to the frequent production of physically implausible motions with pronounced artifacts such as floating and foot sliding. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Morph}, a \textbf{Mo}tion-f\textbf{r}ee \textbf{ph}ysics optimization framework, comprising a Motion Generator and a Motion Physics Refinement module, for enhancing physical plausibility without relying on costly real-world motion data. Specifically, the Motion Generator is responsible for providing large-scale synthetic motion data, while the Motion Physics Refinement Module utilizes these synthetic data to train a motion imitator within a physics simulator, enforcing physical constraints to project the noisy motions into a physically-plausible space. These physically refined motions, in turn, are used to fine-tune the Motion Generator, further enhancing its capability. Experiments on both text-to-motion and music-to-dance generation tasks demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art motion generation quality while improving physical plausibility drastically.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Vision Transformer Models for Visual Quality Control in Industrial Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising use-cases for machine learning in industrial manufacturing is the early detection of defective products using a quality control system. Such a system can save costs and reduces human errors due to the monotonous nature of visual inspections. Today, a rich body of research exists which employs machine learning methods to identify rare defective products in unbalanced visual quality control datasets. These methods typically rely on two components: A visual backbone to capture the features of the input image and an anomaly detection algorithm that decides if these features are within an expected distribution. With the rise of transformer architecture as visual backbones of choice, there exists now a great variety of different combinations of these two components, ranging all along the trade-off between detection quality and inference time. Facing this variety, practitioners in the field often have to spend a considerable amount of time on researching the right combination for their use-case at hand. Our contribution is to help practitioners with this choice by reviewing and evaluating current vision transformer models together with anomaly detection methods. For this, we chose SotA models of both disciplines, combined them and evaluated them towards the goal of having small, fast and efficient anomaly detection models suitable for industrial manufacturing. We evaluated the results of our experiments on the well-known MVTecAD and BTAD datasets. Moreover, we give guidelines for choosing a suitable model architecture for a quality control system in practice, considering given use-case and hardware constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphic designs are an effective medium for visual communication. They range from greeting cards to corporate flyers and beyond. Off-late, machine learning techniques are able to generate such designs, which accelerates the rate of content production. An automated way of evaluating their quality becomes critical. Towards this end, we introduce Design-o-meter, a data-driven methodology to quantify the goodness of graphic designs. Further, our approach can suggest modifications to these designs to improve its visual appeal. To the best of our knowledge, Design-o-meter is the first approach that scores and refines designs in a unified framework despite the inherent subjectivity and ambiguity of the setting. Our exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach against baselines adapted for the task (including recent Multimodal LLM-based approaches) brings out the efficacy of our methodology. We hope our work will usher more interest in this important and pragmatic problem setting.</description>

      <title>3D Convex Splatting: Radiance Field Rendering with 3D Smooth Convexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in radiance field reconstruction, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have achieved high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering by representing scenes with compositions of Gaussian primitives. However, 3D Gaussians present several limitations for scene reconstruction. Accurately capturing hard edges is challenging without significantly increasing the number of Gaussians, creating a large memory footprint. Moreover, they struggle to represent flat surfaces, as they are diffused in space. Without hand-crafted regularizers, they tend to disperse irregularly around the actual surface. To circumvent these issues, we introduce a novel method, named 3D Convex Splatting (3DCS), which leverages 3D smooth convexes as primitives for modeling geometrically-meaningful radiance fields from multi-view images. Smooth convex shapes offer greater flexibility than Gaussians, allowing for a better representation of 3D scenes with hard edges and dense volumes using fewer primitives. Powered by our efficient CUDA-based rasterizer, 3DCS achieves superior performance over 3DGS on benchmarks such as Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending. Specifically, our method attains an improvement of up to 0.81 in PSNR and 0.026 in LPIPS compared to 3DGS while maintaining high rendering speeds and reducing the number of required primitives. Our results highlight the potential of 3D Convex Splatting to become the new standard for high-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) lead to significant breakthroughs in both academia and industry. One question that arises is how we, as humans, can understand their internal neural representations. This paper takes an initial step towards addressing this question by presenting a versatile framework to identify and interpret the semantics within LMMs. Specifically, 1) we first apply a Sparse Autoencoder(SAE) to disentangle the representations into human understandable features. 2) We then present an automatic interpretation framework to interpreted the open-semantic features learned in SAE by the LMMs themselves. We employ this framework to analyze the LLaVA-NeXT-8B model using the LLaVA-OV-72B model, demonstrating that these features can effectively steer the model's behavior. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of why LMMs excel in specific tasks, including EQ tests, and illuminate the nature of their mistakes along with potential strategies for their rectification. These findings offer new insights into the internal mechanisms of LMMs and suggest parallels with the cognitive processes of the human brain.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Biomechanics for Markerless Motion Capture in Upper Limb Stroke Rehabilitation: A Comparison with Optical Motion Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marker-based Optical Motion Capture (OMC) paired with biomechanical modeling is currently considered the most precise and accurate method for measuring human movement kinematics. However, combining differentiable biomechanical modeling with Markerless Motion Capture (MMC) offers a promising approach to motion capture in clinical settings, requiring only minimal equipment, such as synchronized webcams, and minimal effort for data collection. This study compares key kinematic outcomes from biomechanically modeled MMC and OMC data in 15 stroke patients performing the drinking task, a functional task recommended for assessing upper limb movement quality. We observed a high level of agreement in kinematic trajectories between MMC and OMC, as indicated by high correlations (median r above 0.95 for the majority of kinematic trajectories) and median RMSE values ranging from 2-5 degrees for joint angles, 0.04 m/s for end-effector velocity, and 6 mm for trunk displacement. Trial-to-trial biases between OMC and MMC were consistent within participant sessions, with interquartile ranges of bias around 1-3 degrees for joint angles, 0.01 m/s in end-effector velocity, and approximately 3mm for trunk displacement. Our findings indicate that our MMC for arm tracking is approaching the accuracy of marker-based methods, supporting its potential for use in clinical settings. MMC could provide valuable insights into movement rehabilitation in stroke patients, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies.</description>

      <title>MSSF: A 4D Radar and Camera Fusion Framework With Multi-Stage Sampling for 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the automotive sensors that have emerged in recent years, 4D millimeter-wave radar has a higher resolution than conventional 3D radar and provides precise elevation measurements. But its point clouds are still sparse and noisy, making it challenging to meet the requirements of autonomous driving. Camera, as another commonly used sensor, can capture rich semantic information. As a result, the fusion of 4D radar and camera can provide an affordable and robust perception solution for autonomous driving systems. However, previous radar-camera fusion methods have not yet been thoroughly investigated, resulting in a large performance gap compared to LiDAR-based methods. Specifically, they ignore the feature-blurring problem and do not deeply interact with image semantic information. To this end, we present a simple but effective multi-stage sampling fusion (MSSF) network based on 4D radar and camera. On the one hand, we design a fusion block that can deeply interact point cloud features with image features, and can be applied to commonly used single-modal backbones in a plug-and-play manner. The fusion block encompasses two types, namely, simple feature fusion (SFF) and multiscale deformable feature fusion (MSDFF). The SFF is easy to implement, while the MSDFF has stronger fusion abilities. On the other hand, we propose a semantic-guided head to perform foreground-background segmentation on voxels with voxel feature re-weighting, further alleviating the problem of feature blurring. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadset datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MSSF. Notably, compared to state-of-the-art methods, MSSF achieves a 7.0% and 4.0% improvement in 3D mean average precision on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets, respectively. It even surpasses classical LiDAR-based methods on the VoD dataset.</description>

      <title>Neural 4D Evolution under Large Topological Changes from 2D Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature, it has been shown that the evolution of the known explicit 3D surface to the target one can be learned from 2D images using the instantaneous flow field, where the known and target 3D surfaces may largely differ in topology. We are interested in capturing 4D shapes whose topology changes largely over time. We encounter that the straightforward extension of the existing 3D-based method to the desired 4D case performs poorly.
  In this work, we address the challenges in extending 3D neural evolution to 4D under large topological changes by proposing two novel modifications. More precisely, we introduce (i) a new architecture to discretize and encode the deformation and learn the SDF and (ii) a technique to impose the temporal consistency. (iii) Also, we propose a rendering scheme for color prediction based on Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, to facilitate learning directly from 2D images, we propose a learning framework that can disentangle the geometry and appearance from RGB images. This method of disentanglement, while also useful for the 4D evolution problem that we are concentrating on, is also novel and valid for static scenes. Our extensive experiments on various data provide awesome results and, most importantly, open a new approach toward reconstructing challenging scenes with significant topological changes and deformations. Our source code and the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/insait-institute/N4DE.</description>

      <title>DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.</description>

      <title>FloAt: Flow Warping of Self-Attention for Clothing Animation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a diffusion model-based approach, FloAtControlNet to generate cinemagraphs composed of animations of human clothing. We focus on human clothing like dresses, skirts and pants. The input to our model is a text prompt depicting the type of clothing and the texture of clothing like leopard, striped, or plain, and a sequence of normal maps that capture the underlying animation that we desire in the output. The backbone of our method is a normal-map conditioned ControlNet which is operated in a training-free regime. The key observation is that the underlying animation is embedded in the flow of the normal maps. We utilize the flow thus obtained to manipulate the self-attention maps of appropriate layers. Specifically, the self-attention maps of a particular layer and frame are recomputed as a linear combination of itself and the self-attention maps of the same layer and the previous frame, warped by the flow on the normal maps of the two frames. We show that manipulating the self-attention maps greatly enhances the quality of the clothing animation, making it look more natural as well as suppressing the background artifacts. Through extensive experiments, we show that the method proposed beats all baselines both qualitatively in terms of visual results and user study. Specifically, our method is able to alleviate the background flickering that exists in other diffusion model-based baselines that we consider. In addition, we show that our method beats all baselines in terms of RMSE and PSNR computed using the input normal map sequences and the normal map sequences obtained from the output RGB frames. Further, we show that well-established evaluation metrics like LPIPS, SSIM, and CLIP scores that are generally for visual quality are not necessarily suitable for capturing the subtle motions in human clothing animations.</description>

      <title>HeadRouter: A Training-free Image Editing Framework for MM-DiTs by Adaptively Routing Attention Heads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have exhibited robust capabilities in image generation tasks. However, accurate text-guided image editing for multimodal DiTs (MM-DiTs) still poses a significant challenge. Unlike UNet-based structures that could utilize self/cross-attention maps for semantic editing, MM-DiTs inherently lack support for explicit and consistent incorporated text guidance, resulting in semantic misalignment between the edited results and texts. In this study, we disclose the sensitivity of different attention heads to different image semantics within MM-DiTs and introduce HeadRouter, a training-free image editing framework that edits the source image by adaptively routing the text guidance to different attention heads in MM-DiTs. Furthermore, we present a dual-token refinement module to refine text/image token representations for precise semantic guidance and accurate region expression. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate HeadRouter's performance in terms of editing fidelity and image quality.</description>

      <title>OVO-SLAM: Open-Vocabulary Online Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first Open-Vocabulary Online 3D semantic SLAM pipeline, that we denote as OVO-SLAM. Our primary contribution is in the pipeline itself, particularly in the mapping thread. Given a set of posed RGB-D frames, we detect and track 3D segments, which we describe using CLIP vectors, calculated through a novel aggregation from the viewpoints where these 3D segments are observed. Notably, our OVO-SLAM pipeline is not only faster but also achieves better segmentation metrics compared to offline approaches in the literature. Along with superior segmentation performance, we show experimental results of our contributions integrated with Gaussian-SLAM, being the first ones demonstrating end-to-end open-vocabulary online 3D reconstructions without relying on ground-truth camera poses or scene geometry.</description>

      <title>SPAC-Net: Rethinking Point Cloud Completion with Structural Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to infer a complete shape from its partial observation. Many approaches utilize a pure encoderdecoder paradigm in which complete shape can be directly predicted by shape priors learned from partial scans, however, these methods suffer from the loss of details inevitably due to the feature abstraction issues. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,termed SPAC-Net, that aims to rethink the completion task under the guidance of a new structural prior, we call it interface. Specifically, our method first investigates Marginal Detector (MAD) module to localize the interface, defined as the intersection between the known observation and the missing parts. Based on the interface, our method predicts the coarse shape by learning the displacement from the points in interface move to their corresponding position in missing parts. Furthermore, we devise an additional Structure Supplement(SSP) module before the upsampling stage to enhance the structural details of the coarse shape, enabling the upsampling module to focus more on the upsampling task. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several challenging benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning to Stabilize Faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, it is possible to scan faces and automatically register them with high quality. However, the resulting face meshes often need further processing: we need to stabilize them to remove unwanted head movement. Stabilization is important for tasks like game development or movie making which require facial expressions to be cleanly separated from rigid head motion. Since manual stabilization is labor-intensive, there have been attempts to automate it. However, previous methods remain impractical: they either still require some manual input, produce imprecise alignments, rely on dubious heuristics and slow optimization, or assume a temporally ordered input. Instead, we present a new learning-based approach that is simple and fully automatic. We treat stabilization as a regression problem: given two face meshes, our network directly predicts the rigid transform between them that brings their skulls into alignment. We generate synthetic training data using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), exploiting the fact that 3DMM parameters separate skull motion from facial skin motion. Through extensive experiments we show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art both quantitatively and qualitatively on the tasks of stabilizing discrete sets of facial expressions as well as dynamic facial performances. Furthermore, we provide an ablation study detailing the design choices and best practices to help others adopt our approach for their own uses. Supplementary videos can be found on the project webpage syntec-research.github.io/FaceStab.</description>

      <title>Instance-Aware Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works on Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES) struggle with handling complex expressions referring to multiple distinct objects. This is because these methods typically employ an end-to-end foreground-background segmentation and lack a mechanism to explicitly differentiate and associate different object instances to the text query. To this end, we propose InstAlign, a method that incorporates object-level reasoning into the segmentation process. Our model leverages both text and image inputs to extract a set of object-level tokens that capture both the semantic information in the input prompt and the objects within the image. By modeling the text-object alignment via instance-level supervision, each token uniquely represents an object segment in the image, while also aligning with relevant semantic information from the text. Extensive experiments on the gRefCOCO and Ref-ZOM benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly advances state-of-the-art performance, setting a new standard for precise and flexible GRES.</description>

      <title>OminiControl: Minimal and Universal Control for Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OminiControl, a highly versatile and parameter-efficient framework that integrates image conditions into pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models. At its core, OminiControl leverages a parameter reuse mechanism, enabling the DiT to encode image conditions using itself as a powerful backbone and process them with its flexible multi-modal attention processors. Unlike existing methods, which rely heavily on additional encoder modules with complex architectures, OminiControl (1) effectively and efficiently incorporates injected image conditions with only ~0.1% additional parameters, and (2) addresses a wide range of image conditioning tasks in a unified manner, including subject-driven generation and spatially-aligned conditions such as edges, depth, and more. Remarkably, these capabilities are achieved by training on images generated by the DiT itself, which is particularly beneficial for subject-driven generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that OminiControl outperforms existing UNet-based and DiT-adapted models in both subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditional generation. Additionally, we release our training dataset, Subjects200K, a diverse collection of over 200,000 identity-consistent images, along with an efficient data synthesis pipeline to advance research in subject-consistent generation.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Multimodal Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale multimodal representation learning successfully optimizes for zero-shot transfer at test time. Yet the standard pretraining paradigm (contrastive learning on large amounts of image-text data) does not explicitly encourage representations to support few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose a simple, but carefully designed extension to multimodal pretraining which enables representations to accommodate additional context. Using this objective, we show that vision-language models can be trained to exhibit significantly increased few-shot adaptation: across 21 downstream tasks, we find up to four-fold improvements in test-time sample efficiency, and average few-shot adaptation gains of over 5%, while retaining zero-shot generalization performance across model scales and training durations. In particular, equipped with simple, training-free, metric-based adaptation mechanisms, our representations easily surpass more complex and expensive optimization-based schemes, vastly simplifying generalization to new domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have witnessed impressive advances in video action understanding. Increased dataset sizes, variability, and computation availability have enabled leaps in performance and task diversification. Current systems can provide coarse- and fine-grained descriptions of video scenes, extract segments corresponding to queries, synthesize unobserved parts of videos, and predict context. This survey comprehensively reviews advances in uni- and multi-modal action understanding across a range of tasks. We focus on prevalent challenges, overview widely adopted datasets, and survey seminal works with an emphasis on recent advances. We broadly distinguish between three temporal scopes: (1) recognition tasks of actions observed in full, (2) prediction tasks for ongoing partially observed actions, and (3) forecasting tasks for subsequent unobserved action. This division allows us to identify specific action modeling and video representation challenges. Finally, we outline future directions to address current shortcomings.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time DETR Approach to Bangladesh Road Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent years, we have witnessed a paradigm shift in the field of Computer Vision, with the forthcoming of the transformer architecture. Detection Transformers has become a state of the art solution to object detection and is a potential candidate for Road Object Detection in Autonomous Vehicles. Despite the abundance of object detection schemes, real-time DETR models are shown to perform significantly better on inference times, with minimal loss of accuracy and performance. In our work, we used Real-Time DETR (RTDETR) object detection on the BadODD Road Object Detection dataset based in Bangladesh, and performed necessary experimentation and testing. Our results gave a mAP50 score of 0.41518 in the public 60% test set, and 0.28194 in the private 40% test set.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pruning of Text-to-Image Models: Insights from Pruning Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As text-to-image models grow increasingly powerful and complex, their burgeoning size presents a significant obstacle to widespread adoption, especially on resource-constrained devices. This paper presents a pioneering study on post-training pruning of Stable Diffusion 2, addressing the critical need for model compression in text-to-image domain. Our study tackles the pruning techniques for the previously unexplored multi-modal generation models, and particularly examines the pruning impact on the textual component and the image generation component separately. We conduct a comprehensive comparison on pruning the model or the single component of the model in various sparsities. Our results yield previously undocumented findings. For example, contrary to established trends in language model pruning, we discover that simple magnitude pruning outperforms more advanced techniques in text-to-image context. Furthermore, our results show that Stable Diffusion 2 can be pruned to 38.5% sparsity with minimal quality loss, achieving a significant reduction in model size. We propose an optimal pruning configuration that prunes the text encoder to 47.5% and the diffusion generator to 35%. This configuration maintains image generation quality while substantially reducing computational requirements. In addition, our work uncovers intriguing questions about information encoding in text-to-image models: we observe that pruning beyond certain thresholds leads to sudden performance drops (unreadable images), suggesting that specific weights encode critical semantics information. This finding opens new avenues for future research in model compression, interoperability, and bias identification in text-to-image models. By providing crucial insights into the pruning behavior of text-to-image models, our study lays the groundwork for developing more efficient and accessible AI-driven image generation systems</description>

      <title>VideoRepair: Improving Text-to-Video Generation via Misalignment Evaluation and Localized Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities across various domains. However, these models often generate videos that have misalignments with text prompts, especially when the prompts describe complex scenes with multiple objects and attributes. To address this, we introduce VideoRepair, a novel model-agnostic, training-free video refinement framework that automatically identifies fine-grained text-video misalignments and generates explicit spatial and textual feedback, enabling a T2V diffusion model to perform targeted, localized refinements. VideoRepair consists of four stages: In (1) video evaluation, we detect misalignments by generating fine-grained evaluation questions and answering those questions with MLLM. In (2) refinement planning, we identify accurately generated objects and then create localized prompts to refine other areas in the video. Next, in (3) region decomposition, we segment the correctly generated area using a combined grounding module. We regenerate the video by adjusting the misaligned regions while preserving the correct regions in (4) localized refinement. On two popular video generation benchmarks (EvalCrafter and T2V-CompBench), VideoRepair substantially outperforms recent baselines across various text-video alignment metrics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of VideoRepair components and qualitative examples.</description>

      <title>ReXrank: A Public Leaderboard for AI-Powered Radiology Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-driven models have demonstrated significant potential in automating radiology report generation for chest X-rays. However, there is no standardized benchmark for objectively evaluating their performance. To address this, we present ReXrank, https://rexrank.ai, a public leaderboard and challenge for assessing AI-powered radiology report generation. Our framework incorporates ReXGradient, the largest test dataset consisting of 10,000 studies, and three public datasets (MIMIC-CXR, IU-Xray, CheXpert Plus) for report generation assessment. ReXrank employs 8 evaluation metrics and separately assesses models capable of generating only findings sections and those providing both findings and impressions sections. By providing this standardized evaluation framework, ReXrank enables meaningful comparisons of model performance and offers crucial insights into their robustness across diverse clinical settings. Beyond its current focus on chest X-rays, ReXrank's framework sets the stage for comprehensive evaluation of automated reporting across the full spectrum of medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Material Anything: Generating Materials for Any 3D Object via Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Material Anything, a fully-automated, unified diffusion framework designed to generate physically-based materials for 3D objects. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex pipelines or case-specific optimizations, Material Anything offers a robust, end-to-end solution adaptable to objects under diverse lighting conditions. Our approach leverages a pre-trained image diffusion model, enhanced with a triple-head architecture and rendering loss to improve stability and material quality. Additionally, we introduce confidence masks as a dynamic switcher within the diffusion model, enabling it to effectively handle both textured and texture-less objects across varying lighting conditions. By employing a progressive material generation strategy guided by these confidence masks, along with a UV-space material refiner, our method ensures consistent, UV-ready material outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms existing methods across a wide range of object categories and lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>DiffusionDrive: Truncated Diffusion Model for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful generative technique for robotic policy learning, capable of modeling multi-mode action distributions. Leveraging its capability for end-to-end autonomous driving is a promising direction. However, the numerous denoising steps in the robotic diffusion policy and the more dynamic, open-world nature of traffic scenes pose substantial challenges for generating diverse driving actions at a real-time speed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel truncated diffusion policy that incorporates prior multi-mode anchors and truncates the diffusion schedule, enabling the model to learn denoising from anchored Gaussian distribution to the multi-mode driving action distribution. Additionally, we design an efficient cascade diffusion decoder for enhanced interaction with conditional scene context. The proposed model, DiffusionDrive, demonstrates 10$\times$ reduction in denoising steps compared to vanilla diffusion policy, delivering superior diversity and quality in just 2 steps. On the planning-oriented NAVSIM dataset, with the aligned ResNet-34 backbone, DiffusionDrive achieves 88.1 PDMS without bells and whistles, setting a new record, while running at a real-time speed of 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090. Qualitative results on challenging scenarios further confirm that DiffusionDrive can robustly generate diverse plausible driving actions. Code and model will be available at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionDrive.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Insect Monitoring: Ultra-Lightweight CNNs as On-Device Triggers for Insect Camera Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camera traps, combined with AI, have emerged as a way to achieve automated, scalable biodiversity monitoring. However, the passive infrared (PIR) sensors that trigger camera traps are poorly suited for detecting small, fast-moving ectotherms such as insects. Insects comprise over half of all animal species and are key components of ecosystems and agriculture. The need for an appropriate and scalable insect camera trap is critical in the wake of concerning reports of declines in insect populations. This study proposes an alternative to the PIR trigger: ultra-lightweight convolutional neural networks running on low-powered hardware to detect insects in a continuous stream of captured images. We train a suite of models to distinguish insect images from backgrounds. Our design achieves zero latency between trigger and image capture. Our models are rigorously tested and achieve high accuracy ranging from 91.8% to 96.4% AUC on validation data and &gt;87% AUC on data from distributions unseen during training. The high specificity of our models ensures minimal saving of false positive images, maximising deployment storage efficiency. High recall scores indicate a minimal false negative rate, maximising insect detection. Further analysis with saliency maps shows the learned representation of our models to be robust, with low reliance on spurious background features. Our system is also shown to operate deployed on off-the-shelf, low-powered microcontroller units, consuming a maximum power draw of less than 300mW. This enables longer deployment times using cheap and readily available battery components. Overall we offer a step change in the cost, efficiency and scope of insect monitoring. Solving the challenging trigger problem, we demonstrate a system which can be deployed for far longer than existing designs and budgets power and bandwidth effectively, moving towards a generic insect camera trap.</description>

      <title>Attention-guided Spectrogram Sequence Modeling with CNNs for Music Genre Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music genre classification is a critical component of music recommendation systems, generation algorithms, and cultural analytics. In this work, we present an innovative model for classifying music genres using attention-based temporal signature modeling. By processing spectrogram sequences through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and multi-head attention layers, our approach captures the most temporally significant moments within each piece, crafting a unique "signature" for genre identification. This temporal focus not only enhances classification accuracy but also reveals insights into genre-specific characteristics that can be intuitively mapped to listener perceptions. Our findings offer potential applications in personalized music recommendation systems by highlighting cross-genre similarities and distinctiveness, aligning closely with human musical intuition. This work bridges the gap between technical classification tasks and the nuanced, human experience of genre.</description>

      <title>StreetviewLLM: Extracting Geographic Information Using a Chain-of-Thought Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geospatial predictions are crucial for diverse fields such as disaster management, urban planning, and public health. Traditional machine learning methods often face limitations when handling unstructured or multi-modal data like street view imagery. To address these challenges, we propose StreetViewLLM, a novel framework that integrates a large language model with the chain-of-thought reasoning and multimodal data sources. By combining street view imagery with geographic coordinates and textual data, StreetViewLLM improves the precision and granularity of geospatial predictions. Using retrieval-augmented generation techniques, our approach enhances geographic information extraction, enabling a detailed analysis of urban environments. The model has been applied to seven global cities, including Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, Los Angeles, New York, London, and Paris, demonstrating superior performance in predicting urban indicators, including population density, accessibility to healthcare, normalized difference vegetation index, building height, and impervious surface. The results show that StreetViewLLM consistently outperforms baseline models, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insights into the built environment. This research opens new opportunities for integrating the large language model into urban analytics, decision-making in urban planning, infrastructure management, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thesis proposes a generalized charging framework for multiple mobile chargers to maximize the network lifetime and ensure target coverage and connectivity in large scale WRSNs. Moreover, a multi-point charging model is leveraged to enhance charging efficiency, where the MC can charge multiple sensors simultaneously at each charging location. The thesis proposes an effective Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process (Dec POSMDP) model that promotes Mobile Chargers (MCs) cooperation and detects optimal charging locations based on realtime network information. Furthermore, the proposal allows reinforcement algorithms to be applied to different networks without requiring extensive retraining. To solve the Dec POSMDP model, the thesis proposes an Asynchronous Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm (AMAPPO) based on the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO).</description>

      <title>Are Anomaly Scores Telling the Whole Story? A Benchmark for Multilevel Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a machine learning task that identifies anomalies by learning patterns from normal training data. In many real-world scenarios, anomalies vary in severity, from minor anomalies with little risk to severe abnormalities requiring immediate attention. However, existing models primarily operate in a binary setting, and the anomaly scores they produce are usually based on the deviation of data points from normal data, which may not accurately reflect practical severity. In this paper, we address this gap by making three key contributions. First, we propose a novel setting, Multilevel AD (MAD), in which the anomaly score represents the severity of anomalies in real-world applications, and we highlight its diverse applications across various domains. Second, we introduce a novel benchmark, MAD-Bench, that evaluates models not only on their ability to detect anomalies, but also on how effectively their anomaly scores reflect severity. This benchmark incorporates multiple types of baselines and real-world applications involving severity. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance analysis on MAD-Bench. We evaluate models on their ability to assign severity-aligned scores, investigate the correspondence between their performance on binary and multilevel detection, and study their robustness. This analysis offers key insights into improving AD models for practical severity alignment. The code framework and datasets used for the benchmark will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Memory Backdoor Attacks on Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks, such as image classifiers, are frequently trained on proprietary and confidential datasets. It is generally assumed that once deployed, the training data remains secure, as adversaries are limited to query response interactions with the model, where at best, fragments of arbitrary data can be inferred without any guarantees on their authenticity. In this paper, we propose the memory backdoor attack, where a model is covertly trained to memorize specific training samples and later selectively output them when triggered with an index pattern. What makes this attack unique is that it (1) works even when the tasks conflict (making a classifier output images), (2) enables the systematic extraction of training samples from deployed models and (3) offers guarantees on the extracted authenticity of the data. We demonstrate the attack on image classifiers, segmentation models, and a large language model (LLM). We demonstrate the attack on image classifiers, segmentation models, and a large language model (LLM). With this attack, it is possible to hide thousands of images and texts in modern vision architectures and LLMs respectively, all while maintaining model performance. The memory back door attack poses a significant threat not only to conventional model deployments but also to federated learning paradigms and other modern frameworks. Therefore, we suggest an efficient and effective countermeasure that can be immediately applied and advocate for further work on the topic.</description>

      <title>SegBook: A Simple Baseline and Cookbook for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most popular modalities for medical imaging. By far, CT images have contributed to the largest publicly available datasets for volumetric medical segmentation tasks, covering full-body anatomical structures. Large amounts of full-body CT images provide the opportunity to pre-train powerful models, e.g., STU-Net pre-trained in a supervised fashion, to segment numerous anatomical structures. However, it remains unclear in which conditions these pre-trained models can be transferred to various downstream medical segmentation tasks, particularly segmenting the other modalities and diverse targets. To address this problem, a large-scale benchmark for comprehensive evaluation is crucial for finding these conditions. Thus, we collected 87 public datasets varying in modality, target, and sample size to evaluate the transfer ability of full-body CT pre-trained models. We then employed a representative model, STU-Net with multiple model scales, to conduct transfer learning across modalities and targets. Our experimental results show that (1) there may be a bottleneck effect concerning the dataset size in fine-tuning, with more improvement on both small- and large-scale datasets than medium-size ones. (2) Models pre-trained on full-body CT demonstrate effective modality transfer, adapting well to other modalities such as MRI. (3) Pre-training on the full-body CT not only supports strong performance in structure detection but also shows efficacy in lesion detection, showcasing adaptability across target tasks. We hope that this large-scale open evaluation of transfer learning can direct future research in volumetric medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Hidden: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Underwater Image Enhancement and Its Impact on Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater imagery often suffers from severe degradation that results in low visual quality and object detection performance. This work aims to evaluate state-of-the-art image enhancement models, investigate their impact on underwater object detection, and explore their potential to improve detection performance. To this end, we selected representative underwater image enhancement models covering major enhancement categories and applied them separately to two recent datasets: 1) the Real-World Underwater Object Detection Dataset (RUOD), and 2) the Challenging Underwater Plant Detection Dataset (CUPDD). Following this, we conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses on the enhanced images and developed a quality index (Q-index) to compare the quality distribution of the original and enhanced images. Subsequently, we compared the performance of several YOLO-NAS detection models that are separately trained and tested on the original and enhanced image sets. Then, we performed a correlation study to examine the relationship between enhancement metrics and detection performance. We also analyzed the inference results from the trained detectors presenting cases where enhancement increased the detection performance as well as cases where enhancement revealed missed objects by human annotators. This study suggests that although enhancement generally deteriorates the detection performance, it can still be harnessed in some cases for increased detection performance and more accurate human annotation.</description>

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</description>

      <title>BrightVAE: Luminosity Enhancement in Underexposed Endoscopic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhancement of image luminosity is especially critical in endoscopic images. Underexposed endoscopic images often suffer from reduced contrast and uneven brightness, significantly impacting diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Internal body imaging is challenging due to uneven lighting and shadowy regions. Enhancing such images is essential since precise image interpretation is crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we introduce BrightVAE, an architecture based on the hierarchical Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (hierarchical VQ-VAE) tailored explicitly for enhancing luminosity in low-light endoscopic images. Our architecture is meticulously designed to tackle the unique challenges inherent in endoscopic imaging, such as significant variations in illumination and obscured details due to poor lighting conditions. The proposed model emphasizes advanced feature extraction from three distinct viewpoints-incorporating various receptive fields, skip connections, and feature attentions to robustly enhance image quality and support more accurate medical diagnoses. Through rigorous experimental analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing low-light endoscopic images. To evaluate the performance of our architecture, we employ three widely recognized metrics-SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS-specifically on Endo4IE dataset, which consists of endoscopic images. We evaluated our method using the Endo4IE dataset, which consists exclusively of endoscopic images, and showed significant advancements over the state-of-the-art methods for enhancing luminosity in endoscopic imaging.</description>

      <title>Cross Group Attention and Group-wise Rolling for Multimodal Medical Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal MR image synthesis aims to generate missing modality image by fusing and mapping a few available MRI data. Most existing approaches typically adopt an image-to-image translation scheme. However, these methods often suffer from sub-optimal performance due to the spatial misalignment between different modalities while they are typically treated as input channels. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Group-wise Interaction Network (AGI-Net) that explores both inter-modality and intra-modality relationships for multimodal MR image synthesis. Specifically, groups are first pre-defined along the channel dimension and then we perform an adaptive rolling for the standard convolutional kernel to capture inter-modality spatial correspondences. At the same time, a cross-group attention module is introduced to fuse information across different channel groups, leading to better feature representation. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model on the publicly available IXI and BraTS2023 datasets, where the AGI-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance for multimodal MR image synthesis. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>FedMLLM: Federated Fine-tuning MLLM on Multimodal Heterogeneity Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements, demonstrating powerful capabilities in processing and understanding multimodal data. Fine-tuning MLLMs with Federated Learning (FL) allows for expanding the training data scope by including private data sources, thereby enhancing their practical applicability in privacy-sensitive domains. However, current research remains in the early stage, particularly in addressing the \textbf{multimodal heterogeneities} in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for evaluating various downstream tasks in the federated fine-tuning of MLLMs within multimodal heterogeneous scenarios, laying the groundwork for the research in the field. Our benchmark encompasses two datasets, five comparison baselines, and four multimodal scenarios, incorporating over ten types of modal heterogeneities. To address the challenges posed by modal heterogeneity, we develop a general FedMLLM framework that integrates four representative FL methods alongside two modality-agnostic strategies. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FL paradigm improves the performance of MLLMs by broadening the range of training data and mitigating multimodal heterogeneity.

      <title>Comparative Analysis of nnUNet and MedNeXt for Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation in MRI-guided Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation therapy (RT) is essential in treating head and neck cancer (HNC), with magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)-guided RT offering superior soft tissue contrast and functional imaging. However, manual tumor segmentation is time-consuming and complex, and therfore remains a challenge. In this study, we present our solution as team TUMOR to the HNTS-MRG24 MICCAI Challenge which is focused on automated segmentation of primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and metastatic lymph node gross tumor volume (GTVn) in pre-RT and mid-RT MRI images. We utilized the HNTS-MRG2024 dataset, which consists of 150 MRI scans from patients diagnosed with HNC, including original and registered pre-RT and mid-RT T2-weighted images with corresponding segmentation masks for GTVp and GTVn. We employed two state-of-the-art models in deep learning, nnUNet and MedNeXt. For Task 1, we pretrained models on pre-RT registered and mid-RT images, followed by fine-tuning on original pre-RT images. For Task 2, we combined registered pre-RT images, registered pre-RT segmentation masks, and mid-RT data as a multi-channel input for training. Our solution for Task 1 achieved 1st place in the final test phase with an aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.8254, and our solution for Task 2 ranked 8th with a score of 0.7005. The proposed solution is publicly available at Github Repository.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark Dataset for Collaborative SLAM in Service Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As service environments have become diverse, they have started to demand complicated tasks that are difficult for a single robot to complete. This change has led to an interest in multiple robots instead of a single robot. C-SLAM, as a fundamental technique for multiple service robots, needs to handle diverse challenges such as homogeneous scenes and dynamic objects to ensure that robots operate smoothly and perform their tasks safely. However, existing C-SLAM datasets do not include the various indoor service environments with the aforementioned challenges. To close this gap, we introduce a new multi-modal C-SLAM dataset for multiple service robots in various indoor service environments, called C-SLAM dataset in Service Environments (CSE). We use the NVIDIA Isaac Sim to generate data in various indoor service environments with the challenges that may occur in real-world service environments. By using simulation, we can provide accurate and precisely time-synchronized sensor data, such as stereo RGB, stereo depth, IMU, and ground truth (GT) poses. We configure three common indoor service environments (Hospital, Office, and Warehouse), each of which includes various dynamic objects that perform motions suitable to each environment. In addition, we drive three robots to mimic the actions of real service robots. Through these factors, we generate a more realistic C-SLAM dataset for multiple service robots. We demonstrate our dataset by evaluating diverse state-of-the-art single-robot SLAM and multi-robot SLAM methods. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/vision3d-lab/CSE_Dataset.</description>

      <title>FastGrasp: Efficient Grasp Synthesis with Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively modeling the interaction between human hands and objects is challenging due to the complex physical constraints and the requirement for high generation efficiency in applications. Prior approaches often employ computationally intensive two-stage approaches, which first generate an intermediate representation, such as contact maps, followed by an iterative optimization procedure that updates hand meshes to capture the hand-object relation. However, due to the high computation complexity during the optimization stage, such strategies often suffer from low efficiency in inference. To address this limitation, this work introduces a novel diffusion-model-based approach that generates the grasping pose in a one-stage manner. This allows us to significantly improve generation speed and the diversity of generated hand poses. In particular, we develop a Latent Diffusion Model with an Adaptation Module for object-conditioned hand pose generation and a contact-aware loss to enforce the physical constraints between hands and objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster inference, higher diversity, and superior pose quality than state-of-the-art approaches.

      <title>Simplifying CLIP: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale Models on Consumer-level Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has attracted a surge of attention for its superior zero-shot performance and excellent transferability to downstream tasks. However, training such large-scale models usually requires substantial computation and storage, which poses barriers for general users with consumer-level computers. Motivated by this observation, in this paper we investigate how to achieve competitive performance on only one Nvidia RTX3090 GPU and with one terabyte for storing dataset. On one hand, we simplify the transformer block structure and combine Weight Inheritance with multi-stage Knowledge Distillation (WIKD), thereby reducing the parameters and improving the inference speed during training along with deployment. On the other hand, confronted with the convergence challenge posed by small dataset, we generate synthetic captions for each sample as data augmentation, and devise a novel Pair Matching (PM) loss to fully exploit the distinguishment among positive and negative image-text pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can achieve a new state-of-the-art datascale-parameter-accuracy tradeoff, which could further popularize the CLIP model in the related research community.</description>

      <title>Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</description>

      <title>Cell as Point: One-Stage Framework for Efficient Cell Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular activities are dynamic and intricate, playing a crucial role in advancing diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, yet they often require substantial resources for accurate tracking. Despite recent progress, the conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches not only heavily rely on detection or segmentation results as a prerequisite for the tracking stage, demanding plenty of refined segmentation masks, but are also deteriorated by imbalanced and long sequence data, leading to under-learning in training and missing cells in inference procedures. To alleviate the above issues, this paper proposes the novel end-to-end CAP framework, which leverages the idea of regarding Cell as Point to achieve efficient and stable cell tracking in one stage. CAP abandons detection or segmentation stages and simplifies the process by exploiting the correlation among the trajectories of cell points to track cells jointly, thus reducing the label demand and complexity of the pipeline. With cell point trajectory and visibility to represent cell locations and lineage relationships, CAP leverages the key innovations of adaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling for addressing data imbalance in cell division events and the rolling-as-window (RAW) inference method to ensure continuous tracking of new cells in the long term. Eliminating the need for a prerequisite detection or segmentation stage, CAP demonstrates strong cell tracking performance while also being 10 to 55 times more efficient than existing methods. The code and models will be released.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Robustness of Optical Flow Estimation to Corruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical flow estimation is extensively used in autonomous driving and video editing. While existing models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, the robustness of these methods has been infrequently investigated. Despite some research focusing on the robustness of optical flow models against adversarial attacks, there has been a lack of studies investigating their robustness to common corruptions. Taking into account the unique temporal characteristics of optical flow, we introduce 7 temporal corruptions specifically designed for benchmarking the robustness of optical flow models, in addition to 17 classical single-image corruptions, in which advanced PSF Blur simulation method is performed. Two robustness benchmarks, KITTI-FC and GoPro-FC, are subsequently established as the first corruption robustness benchmark for optical flow estimation, with Out-Of-Domain (OOD) and In-Domain (ID) settings to facilitate comprehensive studies. Robustness metrics, Corruption Robustness Error (CRE), Corruption Robustness Error ratio (CREr), and Relative Corruption Robustness Error (RCRE) are further introduced to quantify the optical flow estimation robustness. 29 model variants from 15 optical flow methods are evaluated, yielding 10 intriguing observations, such as 1) the absolute robustness of the model is heavily dependent on the estimation performance; 2) the corruptions that diminish local information are more serious than that reduce visual effects. We also give suggestions for the design and application of optical flow models. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as a foundational resource for advancing research in robust optical flow estimation. The benchmarks and source code will be released at https://github.com/ZhonghuaYi/optical_flow_robustness_benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the implementation of a learning-based lane detection algorithm on an Autonomous Mobile Robot. It aims to implement the Ultra Fast Lane Detection algorithm for real-time application on the SEATER P2MC-BRIN prototype using a camera and optimize its performance on the Jetson Nano platform. Preliminary experiments were conducted to evaluate the algorithm's performance in terms of data processing speed and accuracy using two types of datasets: outdoor using a public dataset and indoor using an internal dataset from the indoor area of the BRIN Workshop Building in Bandung. The experiments revealed that the algorithm runs more optimally on the Jetson Nano platform after conversion to TensorRT compared to the ONNX model, achieving processing speeds of approximately 101 ms using CULane and 105 ms using TuSimple, which is about 22 times faster than the previous model. While the algorithm demonstrates good accuracy on the outdoor public dataset, its performance falls short on the indoor dataset. Future work should focus on transfer learning and fine-tuning to enhance indoor lane detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>LoRA-FAIR: Federated LoRA Fine-Tuning with Aggregation and Initialization Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks with task-specific fine-tuning, yet full parameter fine-tuning is often computationally prohibitive for large models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduce this cost by introducing low-rank matrices for tuning fewer parameters. While LoRA allows for efficient fine-tuning, it requires significant data for adaptation, making Federated Learning (FL) an appealing solution due to its privacy-preserving collaborative framework. However, combining LoRA with FL introduces two key challenges: the \textbf{Server-Side LoRA Aggregation Bias}, where server-side averaging of LoRA matrices diverges from the ideal global update, and the \textbf{Client-Side LoRA Initialization Drift}, emphasizing the need for consistent initialization across rounds. Existing approaches address these challenges individually, limiting their effectiveness. We propose LoRA-FAIR, a novel method that tackles both issues by introducing a correction term on the server while keeping the original LoRA modules, enhancing aggregation efficiency and accuracy. LoRA-FAIR maintains computational and communication efficiency, yielding superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on ViT and MLP-Mixer models across large-scale datasets demonstrate that LoRA-FAIR consistently achieves performance improvements in FL settings.</description>

      <title>SwissADT: An Audio Description Translation System for Swiss Languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio description (AD) is a crucial accessibility service provided to blind persons and persons with visual impairment, designed to convey visual information in acoustic form. Despite recent advancements in multilingual machine translation research, the lack of well-crafted and time-synchronized AD data impedes the development of audio description translation (ADT) systems that address the needs of multilingual countries such as Switzerland. Furthermore, since the majority of ADT systems rely solely on text, uncertainty exists as to whether incorporating visual information from the corresponding video clips can enhance the quality of ADT outputs. In this work, we present SwissADT, the first ADT system implemented for three main Swiss languages and English. By collecting well-crafted AD data augmented with video clips in German, French, Italian, and English, and leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we aim to enhance information accessibility for diverse language populations in Switzerland by automatically translating AD scripts to the desired Swiss language. Our extensive experimental ADT results, composed of both automatic and human evaluations of ADT quality, demonstrate the promising capability of SwissADT for the ADT task. We believe that combining human expertise with the generation power of LLMs can further enhance the performance of ADT systems, ultimately benefiting a larger multilingual target population.</description>

      <title>Exploring Foundation Models Fine-Tuning for Cytology Classification</title>

Abstract: Cytology slides are essential tools in diagnosing and staging cancer, but their analysis is time-consuming and costly. Foundation models have shown great potential to assist in these tasks. In this paper, we explore how existing foundation models can be applied to cytological classification. More particularly, we focus on low-rank adaptation, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method suited to few-shot learning. We evaluated five foundation models across four cytological classification datasets. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning the pre-trained backbones with LoRA significantly improves model performance compared to fine-tuning only the classifier head, achieving state-of-the-art results on both simple and complex classification tasks while requiring fewer data samples.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Biases (What are They) and Where to Find Them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning models tend to learn correlations of patterns on huge datasets. The bigger these systems are, the more complex are the phenomena they can detect, and the more data they need for this. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in our society, and its impact is growing everyday. The promises it holds strongly depend on their fair and universal use, such as access to information or education for all. In a world of inequalities, they can help to reach the most disadvantaged areas. However, such a universal systems must be able to represent society, without benefiting some at the expense of others. We must not reproduce the inequalities observed throughout the world, but educate these IAs to go beyond them. We have seen cases where these systems use gender, race, or even class information in ways that are not appropriate for resolving their tasks. Instead of real causal reasoning, they rely on spurious correlations, which is what we usually call a bias. In this paper, we first attempt to define what is a bias in general terms. It helps us to demystify the concept of bias, to understand why we can find them everywhere and why they are sometimes useful. Second, we focus over the notion of what is generally seen as negative bias, the one we want to avoid in machine learning, before presenting a general zoology containing the most common of these biases. We finally conclude by looking at classical methods to detect them, by means of specially crafted datasets of templates and specific algorithms, and also classical methods to mitigate them.</description>

      <title>Detecting Hallucinations in Virtual Histology with Neural Precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant biomedical research and clinical care rely on the histopathologic examination of tissue structure using microscopy of stained tissue. Virtual staining (VS) offers a promising alternative with the potential to reduce cost and eliminate the use of toxic reagents. However, the critical challenge of hallucinations limits confidence in its use, necessitating a VS co-pilot to detect these hallucinations. Here, we first formally establish the problem of hallucination detection in VS. Next, we introduce a scalable, post-hoc hallucination detection method that identifies a Neural Hallucination Precursor (NHP) from VS model embeddings for test-time detection. We report extensive validation across diverse and challenging VS settings to demonstrate NHP's effectiveness and robustness. Furthermore, we show that VS models with fewer hallucinations do not necessarily disclose them better, risking a false sense of security when reporting just the former metric. This highlights the need for a reassessment of current VS evaluation practices.</description>

      <title>RankByGene: Gene-Guided Histopathology Representation Learning Through Cross-Modal Ranking Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides essential spatial context by mapping gene expression within tissue, enabling detailed study of cellular heterogeneity and tissue organization. However, aligning ST data with histology images poses challenges due to inherent spatial distortions and modality-specific variations. Existing methods largely rely on direct alignment, which often fails to capture complex cross-modal relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that aligns gene and image features using a ranking-based alignment loss, preserving relative similarity across modalities and enabling robust multi-scale alignment. To further enhance the alignment's stability, we employ self-supervised knowledge distillation with a teacher-student network architecture, effectively mitigating disruptions from high dimensionality, sparsity, and noise in gene expression data. Extensive experiments on gene expression prediction and survival analysis demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, showing improved alignment and predictive performance over existing methods and establishing a robust tool for gene-guided image representation learning in digital pathology.</description>

      <title>Leapfrog Latent Consistency Model (LLCM) for Medical Images Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of accessible medical image data poses a significant obstacle in effectively training deep learning models for medical diagnosis, as hospitals refrain from sharing their data due to privacy concerns. In response, we gathered a diverse dataset named MedImgs, which comprises over 250,127 images spanning 61 disease types and 159 classes of both humans and animals from open-source repositories. We propose a Leapfrog Latent Consistency Model (LLCM) that is distilled from a retrained diffusion model based on the collected MedImgs dataset, which enables our model to generate real-time high-resolution images. We formulate the reverse diffusion process as a probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) and solve it in latent space using the Leapfrog algorithm. This formulation enables rapid sampling without necessitating additional iterations. Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in generating medical images. Furthermore, our model can be fine-tuned with any custom medical image datasets, facilitating the generation of a vast array of images. Our experimental results outperform those of existing models on unseen dog cardiac X-ray images. Source code is available at https://github.com/lskdsjy/LeapfrogLCM.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced unsupervised image segmentation for medical images analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide, necessitating the meticulous examination of mammograms by radiologists to characterize abnormal lesions. This manual process demands high accuracy and is often time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. Automated image segmentation using artificial intelligence offers a promising alternative to streamline this workflow. However, most existing methods are supervised, requiring large, expertly annotated datasets that are not always available, and they experience significant generalization issues. Thus, unsupervised learning models can be leveraged for image segmentation, but they come at a cost of reduced accuracy, or require extensive computational resourcess. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end quantum-enhanced framework for unsupervised mammography medical images segmentation that balances between performance accuracy and computational requirements. We first introduce a quantum-inspired image representation that serves as an initial approximation of the segmentation mask. The segmentation task is then formulated as a QUBO problem, aiming to maximize the contrast between the background and the tumor region while ensuring a cohesive segmentation mask with minimal connected components. We conduct an extensive evaluation of quantum and quantum-inspired methods for image segmentation, demonstrating that quantum annealing and variational quantum circuits achieve performance comparable to classical optimization techniques. Notably, quantum annealing is shown to be an order of magnitude faster than the classical optimization method in our experiments. Our findings demonstrate that this framework achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods, including UNet-based architectures, offering a viable unsupervised alternative for breast cancer image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Dimension-independent rates for structured neural density estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that deep neural networks achieve dimension-independent rates of convergence for learning structured densities such as those arising in image, audio, video, and text applications. More precisely, we demonstrate that neural networks with a simple $L^2$-minimizing loss achieve a rate of $n^{-1/(4+r)}$ in nonparametric density estimation when the underlying density is Markov to a graph whose maximum clique size is at most $r$, and we provide evidence that in the aforementioned applications, this size is typically constant, i.e., $r=O(1)$. We then establish that the optimal rate in $L^1$ is $n^{-1/(2+r)}$ which, compared to the standard nonparametric rate of $n^{-1/(2+d)}$, reveals that the effective dimension of such problems is the size of the largest clique in the Markov random field. These rates are independent of the data's ambient dimension, making them applicable to realistic models of image, sound, video, and text data. Our results provide a novel justification for deep learning's ability to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, demonstrating dimension-independent convergence rates in these contexts.</description>

      <title>Health AI Developer Foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust medical Machine Learning (ML) models have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by accelerating clinical research, improving workflows and outcomes, and producing novel insights or capabilities. Developing such ML models from scratch is cost prohibitive and requires substantial compute, data, and time (e.g., expert labeling). To address these challenges, we introduce Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF), a suite of pre-trained, domain-specific foundation models, tools, and recipes to accelerate building ML for health applications. The models cover various modalities and domains, including radiology (X-rays and computed tomography), histopathology, dermatological imaging, and audio. These models provide domain specific embeddings that facilitate AI development with less labeled data, shorter training times, and reduced computational costs compared to traditional approaches. In addition, we utilize a common interface and style across these models, and prioritize usability to enable developers to integrate HAI-DEF efficiently. We present model evaluations across various tasks and conclude with a discussion of their application and evaluation, covering the importance of ensuring efficacy, fairness, and equity. Finally, while HAI-DEF and specifically the foundation models lower the barrier to entry for ML in healthcare, we emphasize the importance of validation with problem- and population-specific data for each desired usage setting. This technical report will be updated over time as more modalities and features are added.</description>

      <title>WildLMa: Long Horizon Loco-Manipulation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: `In-the-wild' mobile manipulation aims to deploy robots in diverse real-world environments, which requires the robot to (1) have skills that generalize across object configurations; (2) be capable of long-horizon task execution in diverse environments; and (3) perform complex manipulation beyond pick-and-place. Quadruped robots with manipulators hold promise for extending the workspace and enabling robust locomotion, but existing results do not investigate such a capability. This paper proposes WildLMa with three components to address these issues: (1) adaptation of learned low-level controller for VR-enabled whole-body teleoperation and traversability; (2) WildLMa-Skill -- a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired via imitation learning or heuristics and (3) WildLMa-Planner -- an interface of learned skills that allow LLM planners to coordinate skills for long-horizon tasks. We demonstrate the importance of high-quality training data by achieving higher grasping success rate over existing RL baselines using only tens of demonstrations. WildLMa exploits CLIP for language-conditioned imitation learning that empirically generalizes to objects unseen in training demonstrations. Besides extensive quantitative evaluation, we qualitatively demonstrate practical robot applications, such as cleaning up trash in university hallways or outdoor terrains, operating articulated objects, and rearranging items on a bookshelf.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Boundaries of Semi-Supervised Facial Expression Recognition using In-Distribution, Out-of-Distribution, and Unconstrained Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have been the key driving force behind much of the recent success of facial expression recognition (FER) systems. However, the need for large amounts of labelled data remains a challenge. Semi-supervised learning offers a way to overcome this limitation, allowing models to learn from a small amount of labelled data along with a large unlabelled dataset. While semi-supervised learning has shown promise in FER, most current methods from general computer vision literature have not been explored in the context of FER. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on 11 of the most recent semi-supervised methods, in the context of FER, namely Pi-model, Pseudo-label, Mean Teacher, VAT, UDA, MixMatch, ReMixMatch, FlexMatch, CoMatch, and CCSSL. Our investigation covers semi-supervised learning from in-distribution, out-of-distribution, unconstrained, and very small unlabelled data. Our evaluation includes five FER datasets plus one large face dataset for unconstrained learning. Our results demonstrate that FixMatch consistently achieves better performance on in-distribution unlabelled data, while ReMixMatch stands out among all methods for out-of-distribution, unconstrained, and scarce unlabelled data scenarios. Another significant observation is that with an equal number of labelled samples, semi-supervised learning delivers a considerable improvement over supervised learning, regardless of whether the unlabelled data is in-distribution, out-of-distribution, or unconstrained. We also conduct sensitivity analyses on critical hyper-parameters for the two best methods of each setting. To facilitate reproducibility and further development, we make our code publicly available at: github.com/ShuvenduRoy/SSL_FER_OOD.</description>

      <title>Semantically-Prompted Language Models Improve Visual Descriptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06077v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language-vision models like CLIP have made significant strides in vision tasks, such as zero-shot image classification (ZSIC). However, generating specific and expressive visual descriptions remains challenging; descriptions produced by current methods are often ambiguous and lacking in granularity. To tackle these issues, we propose V-GLOSS: Visual Glosses, a novel method built upon two key ideas. The first is Semantic Prompting, which conditions a language model on structured semantic knowledge. The second is a new contrastive algorithm that elicits fine-grained distinctions between similar concepts. With both ideas, we demonstrate that V-GLOSS improves visual descriptions and achieves strong results in the zero-shot setting on general and fine-grained image-classification datasets, including ImageNet, STL-10, FGVC Aircraft, and Flowers 102. Moreover, these descriptive capabilities contribute to enhancing image-generation performance. Finally, we introduce a quality-tested silver dataset with descriptions generated with V-GLOSS for all ImageNet classes.</description>

      <title>Neural Deformable Models for 3D Bi-Ventricular Heart Shape Reconstruction and Modeling from 2D Sparse Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel neural deformable model (NDM) targeting at the reconstruction and modeling of 3D bi-ventricular shape of the heart from 2D sparse cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging data. We model the bi-ventricular shape using blended deformable superquadrics, which are parameterized by a set of geometric parameter functions and are capable of deforming globally and locally. While global geometric parameter functions and deformations capture gross shape features from visual data, local deformations, parameterized as neural diffeomorphic point flows, can be learned to recover the detailed heart shape.Different from iterative optimization methods used in conventional deformable model formulations, NDMs can be trained to learn such geometric parameter functions, global and local deformations from a shape distribution manifold. Our NDM can learn to densify a sparse cardiac point cloud with arbitrary scales and generate high-quality triangular meshes automatically. It also enables the implicit learning of dense correspondences among different heart shape instances for accurate cardiac shape registration. Furthermore, the parameters of NDM are intuitive, and can be used by a physician without sophisticated post-processing. Experimental results on a large CMR dataset demonstrate the improved performance of NDM over conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Scrapping The Web For Early Wildfire Detection: A New Annotated Dataset of Images and Videos of Smoke Plumes In-the-wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early wildfire detection is of the utmost importance to enable rapid response efforts, and thus minimize the negative impacts of wildfire spreads. To this end, we present PyroNear-2024, a new dataset composed of both images and videos, allowing for the training and evaluation of smoke plume detection models, including sequential models. The data is sourced from: \textit{(i)} web-scraped videos of wildfires from public networks of cameras for wildfire detection in-the-wild, \text{(ii)} videos from our in-house network of cameras, and \textit{(iii)} a small portion of synthetic and real images. This dataset includes around 150,000 manual annotations on 50,000 images, covering 400 wildfires, \Pyro surpasses existing datasets in size and diversity. It includes data from France, Spain, and the United States. Finally, it is composed of both images and videos, allowing for the training and evaluation of smoke plume detection models, including sequential models. We ran cross-dataset experiments using a lightweight state-of-the-art object detection model and found out the proposed dataset is particularly challenging, with F1 score of around 60%, but more stable than existing datasets. The video part of the dataset can be used to train a lightweight sequential model, improving global recall while maintaining precision. Finally, its use in concordance with other public dataset helps to reach higher results overall. We will make both our code and data available.</description>

      <title>ArcSin: Adaptive ranged cosine Similarity injected noise for Language-Driven Visual Tasks</title>

Abstract: "A data scientist is tasked with developing a low-cost surgical VQA system for a 2-month workshop. Due to data sensitivity, she collects 50 hours of surgical video from a hospital, requiring two months for privacy approvals. Privacy restrictions prevent uploading data to platforms like ChatGPT, so she assembles one annotator and a medical expert to manually create QA pairs. This process takes three weeks and costs over $10,000. The trained model provides accurate responses within the limited data scope but lacks broader generalizability, completing the project in 3 months."
  To simplify the challenges presented in the scenario above. In this paper, we replace the image input with text for Vision-language training. Inspired by prior noise injection methods to reduce modality gaps, we introduce Adaptive ranged cosine Similarity injected noise (ArcSin). First, we introduce an innovative adaptive noise scale that effectively generates the textual elements with more variability while preserving the original text feature's integrity. Second, a similarity pool strategy is employed, expanding the domain generalization potential by broadening the overall noise scale. This dual strategy effectively broadens the scope of the original domain while safeguarding content integrity. Our empirical results demonstrate that these models closely rival those trained on images in terms of performance. Specifically, our method exhibits substantial improvements over the previous state-of-the-art, achieving gains of 1.9 and 1.1 CIDEr points in S-Cap and M-Cap, respectively. Additionally, we observe increases of 0.5 percentage points (pp), 1.4 pp, and 1.4 pp in accuracy for VQA, VQA-E, and VE, respectively, pushing the boundaries of what is achievable within the constraints of image-trained model benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Moving Object Segmentation: All You Need Is SAM (and Flow)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is motion segmentation -- discovering and segmenting the moving objects in a video. This is a much studied area with numerous careful, and sometimes complex, approaches and training schemes including: self-supervised learning, learning from synthetic datasets, object-centric representations, amodal representations, and many more. Our interest in this paper is to determine if the Segment Anything model (SAM) can contribute to this task. We investigate two models for combining SAM with optical flow that harness the segmentation power of SAM with the ability of flow to discover and group moving objects. In the first model, we adapt SAM to take optical flow, rather than RGB, as an input. In the second, SAM takes RGB as an input, and flow is used as a segmentation prompt. These surprisingly simple methods, without any further modifications, outperform all previous approaches by a considerable margin in both single and multi-object benchmarks. We also extend these frame-level segmentations to sequence-level segmentations that maintain object identity. Again, this simple model achieves outstanding performance across multiple moving object segmentation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Diff-IP2D: Diffusion-Based Hand-Object Interaction Prediction on Egocentric Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04370v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how humans would behave during hand-object interaction is vital for applications in service robot manipulation and extended reality. To achieve this, some recent works have been proposed to simultaneously forecast hand trajectories and object affordances on human egocentric videos. The joint prediction serves as a comprehensive representation of future hand-object interactions in 2D space, indicating potential human motion and motivation. However, the existing approaches mostly adopt the autoregressive paradigm for unidirectional prediction, which lacks mutual constraints within the holistic future sequence, and accumulates errors along the time axis. Meanwhile, these works basically overlook the effect of camera egomotion on first-person view predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based interaction prediction method, namely Diff-IP2D, to forecast future hand trajectories and object affordances concurrently in an iterative non-autoregressive manner. We transform the sequential 2D images into latent feature space and design a denoising diffusion model to predict future latent interaction features conditioned on past ones. Motion features are further integrated into the conditional denoising process to enable Diff-IP2D aware of the camera wearer's dynamics for more accurate interaction prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on both the off-the-shelf metrics and our newly proposed evaluation protocol. This highlights the efficacy of leveraging a generative paradigm for 2D hand-object interaction prediction. The code of Diff-IP2D is released as open source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/Diff-IP2D.</description>

Abstract: Virtual staining streamlines traditional staining procedures by digitally generating stained images from unstained or differently stained images. While conventional staining methods involve time-consuming chemical processes, virtual staining offers an efficient and low infrastructure alternative. Leveraging microscopy-based techniques, such as confocal microscopy, researchers can expedite tissue analysis without the need for physical sectioning. However, interpreting grayscale or pseudo-color microscopic images remains a challenge for pathologists and surgeons accustomed to traditional histologically stained images. To fill this gap, various studies explore digitally simulating staining to mimic targeted histological stains. This paper introduces a novel network, In-and-Out Net, specifically designed for virtual staining tasks. Based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), our model efficiently transforms Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM) images into Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained images. We enhance nuclei contrast in RCM images using aluminum chloride preprocessing for skin tissues. Training the model with virtual H\&amp;E labels featuring two fluorescence channels eliminates the need for image registration and provides pixel-level ground truth. Our contributions include proposing an optimal training strategy, conducting a comparative analysis demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, validating the model through an ablation study, and collecting perfectly matched input and ground truth images without registration. In-and-Out Net showcases promising results, offering a valuable tool for virtual staining tasks and advancing the field of histological image analysis.</description>

      <title>SEP: Self-Enhanced Prompt Tuning for Visual-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt tuning based on Context Optimization (CoOp) effectively adapts visual-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks by inferring additional learnable prompt tokens. However, these tokens are less discriminative as they are independent of the pre-trained tokens and fail to capture input-specific knowledge, such as class-aware textual or instance-aware visual knowledge. Leveraging the discriminative and generalization capabilities inherent in pre-trained tokens, we introduce a novel approach named Self-Enhanced Prompt Tuning (SEP). The core principle of SEP involves adapting the learnable prompt tokens at each encoder layer from the corresponding self-pretrained tokens, thereby explicitly incorporating discriminative prior knowledge to enhance both textual-level and visual-level embeddings. Furthermore, SEP's self-enhanced tokens not only boost discrimination but also mitigate domain shifts in unseen domains, enhancing generalization. In practice, SEP selects several representative tokens from all pre-trained tokens for each input data at every layer of the text/visual encoders. Subsequently, a Token Fusion Module (TFM) is introduced to generate a self-enhanced token by merging these representative tokens with the learnable tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. This self-enhanced token is then concatenated with all pre-trained tokens, serving as input for subsequent encoder layers to produce the relevant embeddings. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks and tasks confirm SEP's efficacy in prompt tuning. Code: \href{Code}{https://github.com/htyao89/SEP}.</description>

      <title>CE-VAE: Capsule Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder for Underwater Image Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned underwater image analysis for marine monitoring faces two key challenges: (i) degraded image quality due to light attenuation and (ii) hardware storage constraints limiting high-resolution image collection. Existing methods primarily address image enhancement with approaches that hinge on storing the full-size input. In contrast, we introduce the Capsule Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder (CE-VAE), a novel architecture designed to efficiently compress and enhance degraded underwater images. Our attention-aware image encoder can project the input image onto a latent space representation while being able to run online on a remote device. The only information that needs to be stored on the device or sent to a beacon is a compressed representation. There is a dual-decoder module that performs offline, full-size enhanced image generation. One branch reconstructs spatial details from the compressed latent space, while the second branch utilizes a capsule-clustering layer to capture entity-level structures and complex spatial relationships. This parallel decoding strategy enables the model to balance fine-detail preservation with context-aware enhancements. CE-VAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image enhancement on six benchmark datasets, providing up to 3x higher compression efficiency than existing approaches.

      <title>MaGS: Reconstructing and Simulating Dynamic 3D Objects with Mesh-adsorbed Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction and simulation, although interrelated, have distinct objectives: reconstruction requires a flexible 3D representation that can adapt to diverse scenes, while simulation needs a structured representation to model motion principles effectively. This paper introduces the Mesh-adsorbed Gaussian Splatting (MaGS) method to address this challenge. MaGS constrains 3D Gaussians to roam near the mesh, creating a mutually adsorbed mesh-Gaussian 3D representation. Such representation harnesses both the rendering flexibility of 3D Gaussians and the structured property of meshes. To achieve this, we introduce RMD-Net, a network that learns motion priors from video data to refine mesh deformations, alongside RGD-Net, which models the relative displacement between the mesh and Gaussians to enhance rendering fidelity under mesh constraints. To generalize to novel, user-defined deformations beyond input video without reliance on temporal data, we propose MPE-Net, which leverages inherent mesh information to bootstrap RMD-Net and RGD-Net. Due to the universality of meshes, MaGS is compatible with various deformation priors such as ARAP, SMPL, and soft physics simulation. Extensive experiments on the D-NeRF, DG-Mesh, and PeopleSnapshot datasets demonstrate that MaGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and simulation.</description>

      <title>Cinematic Gaussians: Real-Time HDR Radiance Fields with Depth of Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiance field methods represent the state of the art in reconstructing complex scenes from multi-view photos. However, these reconstructions often suffer from one or both of the following limitations: First, they typically represent scenes in low dynamic range (LDR), which restricts their use to evenly lit environments and hinders immersive viewing experiences. Secondly, their reliance on a pinhole camera model, assuming all scene elements are in focus in the input images, presents practical challenges and complicates refocusing during novel-view synthesis. Addressing these limitations, we present a lightweight method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes multi-view LDR images of a scene with varying exposure times, apertures, and focus distances as input to reconstruct a high-dynamic-range (HDR) radiance field. By incorporating analytical convolutions of Gaussians based on a thin-lens camera model as well as a tonemapping module, our reconstructions enable the rendering of HDR content with flexible refocusing capabilities. We demonstrate that our combined treatment of HDR and depth of field facilitates real-time cinematic rendering, outperforming the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Real-world Image Dehazing with Coherence-based Label Generator and Cooperative Unfolding Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07966v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world Image Dehazing (RID) aims to alleviate haze-induced degradation in real-world settings. This task remains challenging due to the complexities in accurately modeling real haze distributions and the scarcity of paired real-world data. To address these challenges, we first introduce a cooperative unfolding network that jointly models atmospheric scattering and image scenes, effectively integrating physical knowledge into deep networks to restore haze-contaminated details. Additionally, we propose the first RID-oriented iterative mean-teacher framework, termed the Coherence-based Label Generator, to generate high-quality pseudo labels for network training. Specifically, we provide an optimal label pool to store the best pseudo-labels during network training, leveraging both global and local coherence to select high-quality candidates and assign weights to prioritize haze-free regions. We verify the effectiveness of our method, with experiments demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on RID tasks.

      <title>Interpreting the Weight Space of Customized Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the space of weights spanned by a large collection of customized diffusion models. We populate this space by creating a dataset of over 60,000 models, each of which is a base model fine-tuned to insert a different person's visual identity. We model the underlying manifold of these weights as a subspace, which we term weights2weights. We demonstrate three immediate applications of this space that result in new diffusion models -- sampling, editing, and inversion. First, sampling a set of weights from this space results in a new model encoding a novel identity. Next, we find linear directions in this space corresponding to semantic edits of the identity (e.g., adding a beard), resulting in a new model with the original identity edited. Finally, we show that inverting a single image into this space encodes a realistic identity into a model, even if the input image is out of distribution (e.g., a painting). We further find that these linear properties of the diffusion model weight space extend to other visual concepts. Our results indicate that the weight space of fine-tuned diffusion models can behave as an interpretable meta-latent space producing new models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated an excellent understanding of images and 3D data. However, both modalities have shortcomings in holistically capturing the appearance and geometry of objects. Meanwhile, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which encode information within the weights of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), have emerged as an increasingly widespread modality that simultaneously encodes the geometry and photorealistic appearance of objects. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of ingesting NeRF into MLLM. We create LLaNA, the first general-purpose NeRF-language assistant capable of performing new tasks such as NeRF captioning and Q\&amp;A. Notably, our method directly processes the weights of the NeRF's MLP to extract information about the represented objects without the need to render images or materialize 3D data structures. Moreover, we build a dataset of NeRFs with text annotations for various NeRF-language tasks with no human intervention. Based on this dataset, we develop a benchmark to evaluate the NeRF understanding capability of our method. Results show that processing NeRF weights performs favourably against extracting 2D or 3D representations from NeRFs.</description>

      <title>VLM Agents Generate Their Own Memories: Distilling Experience into Embodied Programs of Thought</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14596v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the trajectory into a generalized program of thoughts by correcting inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These programs of thought are iteratively improved through human feedback while the agent executes the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting examples significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent's library of examples grows, it becomes more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the SOTA in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over few-shot GPT4V. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such programs of thought.</description>

      <title>Improving EO Foundation Models with Confidence Assessment for enhanced Semantic segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confidence assessments of semantic segmentation algorithms are important. Ideally, deep learning models should have the ability to predict in advance whether their output is likely to be incorrect. Assessing the confidence levels of model predictions in Earth Observation (EO) classification is essential, as it can enhance semantic segmentation performance and help prevent further exploitation of the results in case of erroneous prediction. The model we developed, Confidence Assessment for enhanced Semantic segmentation (CAS), evaluates confidence at both the segment and pixel levels, providing both labels and confidence scores as output. Our model, CAS, identifies segments with incorrect predicted labels using the proposed combined confidence metric, refines the model, and enhances its performance. This work has significant applications, particularly in evaluating EO Foundation Models on semantic segmentation downstream tasks, such as land cover classification using Sentinel-2 satellite data. The evaluation results show that this strategy is effective and that the proposed model CAS outperforms other baseline models.</description>

Abstract: The primary aim of this manuscript is to underscore a significant limitation in current deep learning models, particularly vision models. Unlike human vision, which efficiently selects only the essential visual areas for further processing, leading to high speed and low energy consumption, deep vision models process the entire image. In this work, we examine this issue from a broader perspective and propose two solutions that could pave the way for the next generation of more efficient vision models. In the first solution, convolution and pooling operations are selectively applied to altered regions, with a change map sent to subsequent layers. This map indicates which computations need to be repeated. In the second solution, only the modified regions are processed by a semantic segmentation model, and the resulting segments are inserted into the corresponding areas of the previous output map.

      <title>More Distinctively Black and Feminine Faces Lead to Increased Stereotyping in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, adeptly integrate text and vision modalities. This integration enhances Large Language Models' ability to mimic human perception, allowing them to process image inputs. Despite VLMs' advanced capabilities, however, there is a concern that VLMs inherit biases of both modalities in ways that make biases more pervasive and difficult to mitigate. Our study explores how VLMs perpetuate homogeneity bias and trait associations with regards to race and gender. When prompted to write stories based on images of human faces, GPT-4V describes subordinate racial and gender groups with greater homogeneity than dominant groups and relies on distinct, yet generally positive, stereotypes. Importantly, VLM stereotyping is driven by visual cues rather than group membership alone such that faces that are rated as more prototypically Black and feminine are subject to greater stereotyping. These findings suggest that VLMs may associate subtle visual cues related to racial and gender groups with stereotypes in ways that could be challenging to mitigate. We explore the underlying reasons behind this behavior and discuss its implications and emphasize the importance of addressing these biases as VLMs come to mirror human perception.</description>

      <title>AutoAD-Zero: A Training-Free Framework for Zero-Shot Audio Description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our objective is to generate Audio Descriptions (ADs) for both movies and TV series in a training-free manner. We use the power of off-the-shelf Visual-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), and develop visual and text prompting strategies for this task. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We demonstrate that a VLM can successfully name and refer to characters if directly prompted with character information through visual indications without requiring any fine-tuning; (ii) A two-stage process is developed to generate ADs, with the first stage asking the VLM to comprehensively describe the video, followed by a second stage utilising a LLM to summarise dense textual information into one succinct AD sentence; (iii) A new dataset for TV audio description is formulated. Our approach, named AutoAD-Zero, demonstrates outstanding performance (even competitive with some models fine-tuned on ground truth ADs) in AD generation for both movies and TV series, achieving state-of-the-art CRITIC scores.</description>

      <title>EMatch: A Unified Framework for Event-based Optical Flow and Stereo Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event cameras have shown promise in vision applications like optical flow estimation and stereo matching, with many specialized architectures leveraging the asynchronous and sparse nature of event data. However, existing works only focus event data within the confines of task-specific domains, overlooking how tasks across the temporal and spatial domains can reinforce each other. In this paper, we reformulate event-based flow estimation and stereo matching as a unified dense correspondence matching problem, enabling us to solve both tasks within a single model by directly matching features in a shared representation space. Specifically, our method utilizes a Temporal Recurrent Network to aggregate event features across temporal or spatial domains, and a Spatial Contextual Attention to enhance knowledge transfer across event flows via temporal or spatial interactions. By utilizing a shared feature similarities module that integrates knowledge from event streams via temporal or spatial interactions, our network performs optical flow estimation from temporal event segment inputs and stereo matching from spatial event segment inputs simultaneously. We demonstrate that our unified model inherently supports multi-task fusion and cross-task transfer. Without the need for retraining for specific task, our model can effectively handle both optical flow and stereo estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.</description>

      <title>WaveMamba: Spatial-Spectral Wavelet Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) has proven to be a powerful tool for capturing detailed spectral and spatial information across diverse applications. Despite the advancements in Deep Learning (DL) and Transformer architectures for HSI classification, challenges such as computational efficiency and the need for extensive labeled data persist. This paper introduces WaveMamba, a novel approach that integrates wavelet transformation with the spatial-spectral Mamba architecture to enhance HSI classification. WaveMamba captures both local texture patterns and global contextual relationships in an end-to-end trainable model. The Wavelet-based enhanced features are then processed through the state-space architecture to model spatial-spectral relationships and temporal dependencies. The experimental results indicate that WaveMamba surpasses existing models, achieving an accuracy improvement of 4.5\% on the University of Houston dataset and a 2.0\% increase on the Pavia University dataset.</description>

      <title>BooW-VTON: Boosting In-the-Wild Virtual Try-On via Mask-Free Pseudo Data Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on is an increasingly popular and important task to generate realistic try-on images of the specific person. Recent methods model virtual try-on as image mask-inpaint task, which requires masking the person image and results in significant loss of spatial information. Especially, for in-the-wild try-on scenarios with complex poses and occlusions, mask-based methods often introduce noticeable artifacts. Our research found that a mask-free approach can fully leverage spatial and lighting information from the original person image, enabling high-quality virtual try-on. Consequently, we propose a novel training paradigm for a mask-free try-on diffusion model. We ensure the model's mask-free try-on capability by creating high-quality pseudo-data and further enhance its handling of complex spatial information through effective in-the-wild data augmentation. Besides, a try-on localization loss is designed to concentrate on try-on area while suppressing garment features in non-try-on areas, ensuring precise rendering of garments and preservation of fore/back-ground. In the end, we introduce BooW-VTON, the mask-free virtual try-on diffusion model, which delivers SOTA try-on quality without parsing cost. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated superior performance in wild scenarios with such a low-demand input.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Hallucinations to Reduce Manual Prompt Dependency in Promptable Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Promptable segmentation typically requires instance-specific manual prompts to guide the segmentation of each desired object. To minimize such a need, task-generic promptable segmentation has been introduced, which employs a single task-generic prompt to segment various images of different objects in the same task. Current methods use Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to reason detailed instance-specific prompts from a task-generic prompt for improving segmentation accuracy. The effectiveness of this segmentation heavily depends on the precision of these derived prompts. However, MLLMs often suffer hallucinations during reasoning, resulting in inaccurate prompting. While existing methods focus on eliminating hallucinations to improve a model, we argue that MLLM hallucinations can reveal valuable contextual insights when leveraged correctly, as they represent pre-trained large-scale knowledge beyond individual images. In this paper, we utilize hallucinations to mine task-related information from images and verify its accuracy for enhancing precision of the generated prompts. Specifically, we introduce an iterative Prompt-Mask Cycle generation framework (ProMaC) with a prompt generator and a mask generator.The prompt generator uses a multi-scale chain of thought prompting, initially exploring hallucinations for extracting extended contextual knowledge on a test image.These hallucinations are then reduced to formulate precise instance-specific prompts, directing the mask generator to produce masks that are consistent with task semantics by mask semantic alignment. The generated masks iteratively induce the prompt generator to focus more on task-relevant image areas and reduce irrelevant hallucinations, resulting jointly in better prompts and masks. Experiments on 5 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ProMaC. Code given in https://lwpyh.github.io/ProMaC/.</description>

Abstract: CycleGAN provides a framework to train image-to-image translation with unpaired datasets using cycle consistency loss [4]. While results are great in many applications, the pixel level cycle consistency can potentially be problematic and causes unrealistic images in certain cases. In this project, we propose three simple modifications to cycle consistency, and show that such an approach achieves better results with fewer artifacts.</description>

      <title>TIMotion: Temporal and Interactive Framework for Efficient Human-Human Motion Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human-human motion generation is essential for understanding humans as social beings. Current methods fall into two main categories: single-person-based methods and separate modeling-based methods. To delve into this field, we abstract the overall generation process into a general framework MetaMotion, which consists of two phases: temporal modeling and interaction mixing. For temporal modeling, the single-person-based methods concatenate two people into a single one directly, while the separate modeling-based methods skip the modeling of interaction sequences. The inadequate modeling described above resulted in sub-optimal performance and redundant model parameters. In this paper, we introduce TIMotion (Temporal and Interactive Modeling), an efficient and effective framework for human-human motion generation. Specifically, we first propose Causal Interactive Injection to model two separate sequences as a causal sequence leveraging the temporal and causal properties. Then we present Role-Evolving Scanning to adjust to the change in the active and passive roles throughout the interaction. Finally, to generate smoother and more rational motion, we design Localized Pattern Amplification to capture short-term motion patterns. Extensive experiments on InterHuman and InterX demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. The project code will be released upon acceptance.

      <title>When to Extract ReID Features: A Selective Approach for Improved Multiple Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting and matching Re-Identification (ReID) features is used by many state-of-the-art (SOTA) Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) methods, particularly effective against frequent and long-term occlusions. While end-to-end object detection and tracking have been the main focus of recent research, they have yet to outperform traditional methods in benchmarks like MOT17 and MOT20. Thus, from an application standpoint, methods with separate detection and embedding remain the best option for accuracy, modularity, and ease of implementation, though they are impractical for edge devices due to the overhead involved. In this paper, we investigate a selective approach to minimize the overhead of feature extraction while preserving accuracy, modularity, and ease of implementation. This approach can be integrated into various SOTA methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to StrongSORT and Deep OC-SORT. Experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets show that our mechanism retains the advantages of feature extraction during occlusions while significantly reducing runtime. Additionally, it improves accuracy by preventing confusion in the feature-matching stage, particularly in cases of deformation and appearance similarity, which are common in DanceTrack. https://github.com/emirhanbayar/Fast-StrongSORT, https://github.com/emirhanbayar/Fast-Deep-OC-SORT</description>

      <title>AFFSegNet: Adaptive Feature Fusion Segmentation Network for Microtumors and Multi-Organ Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation, a crucial task in computer vision, facilitates the automated delineation of anatomical structures and pathologies, supporting clinicians in diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Notably, transformers employing shifted window-based self-attention have demonstrated exceptional performance. However, their reliance on local window attention limits the fusion of local and global contextual information, crucial for segmenting microtumors and miniature organs. To address this limitation, we propose the Adaptive Semantic Segmentation Network (ASSNet), a transformer architecture that effectively integrates local and global features for precise medical image segmentation. ASSNet comprises a transformer-based U-shaped encoder-decoder network. The encoder utilizes shifted window self-attention across five resolutions to extract multi-scale features, which are then propagated to the decoder through skip connections. We introduce an augmented multi-layer perceptron within the encoder to explicitly model long-range dependencies during feature extraction. Recognizing the constraints of conventional symmetrical encoder-decoder designs, we propose an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) decoder to complement our encoder. This decoder incorporates three key components: the Long Range Dependencies (LRD) block, the Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) block, and the Adaptive Semantic Center (ASC) block. These components synergistically facilitate the effective fusion of multi-scale features extracted by the decoder while capturing long-range dependencies and refining object boundaries. Comprehensive experiments on diverse medical image segmentation tasks, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor segmentation, demonstrate that ASSNet achieves state-of-the-art results.

      <title>IRASNet: Improved Feature-Level Clutter Reduction for Domain Generalized SAR-ATR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, computer-aided design models and electromagnetic simulations have been used to augment synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for deep learning. However, an automatic target recognition (ATR) model struggles with domain shift when using synthetic data because the model learns specific clutter patterns present in such data, which disturbs performance when applied to measured data with different clutter distributions. This study proposes a framework particularly designed for domain-generalized SAR-ATR called IRASNet, enabling effective feature-level clutter reduction and domain-invariant feature learning. First, we propose a clutter reduction module (CRM) that maximizes the signal-to-clutter ratio on feature maps. The module reduces the impact of clutter at the feature level while preserving target and shadow information, thereby improving ATR performance. Second, we integrate adversarial learning with CRM to extract clutter-reduced domain-invariant features. The integration bridges the gap between synthetic and measured datasets without requiring measured data during training. Third, we improve feature extraction from target and shadow regions by implementing a positional supervision task using mask ground truth encoding. The improvement enhances the ability of the model to discriminate between classes. Our proposed IRASNet presents new state-of-the-art public SAR datasets utilizing target and shadow information to achieve superior performance across various test conditions. IRASNet not only enhances generalization performance but also significantly improves feature-level clutter reduction, making it a valuable advancement in the field of radar image pattern recognition.</description>

      <title>Boosting Weakly-Supervised Referring Image Segmentation via Progressive Comprehension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the weakly-supervised referring image segmentation (WRIS) problem, and focuses on a challenging setup where target localization is learned directly from image-text pairs. We note that the input text description typically already contains detailed information on how to localize the target object, and we also observe that humans often follow a step-by-step comprehension process (\ie, progressively utilizing target-related attributes and relations as cues) to identify the target object. Hence, we propose a novel Progressive Comprehension Network (PCNet) to leverage target-related textual cues from the input description for progressively localizing the target object. Specifically, we first use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose the input text description into short phrases. These short phrases are taken as target-related cues and fed into a Conditional Referring Module (CRM) in multiple stages, to allow updating the referring text embedding and enhance the response map for target localization in a multi-stage manner. Based on the CRM, we then propose a Region-aware Shrinking (RaS) loss to constrain the visual localization to be conducted progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner across different stages. Finally, we introduce an Instance-aware Disambiguation (IaD) loss to suppress instance localization ambiguity by differentiating overlapping response maps generated by different referring texts on the same image. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms SOTA methods on three common benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Screen Time Identification in Children with a Multi-View Vision Language Model and Screen Time Tracker</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Being able to accurately monitor the screen exposure of young children is important for research on phenomena linked to screen use such as childhood obesity, physical activity, and social interaction. Most existing studies rely upon self-report or manual measures from bulky wearable sensors, thus lacking efficiency and accuracy in capturing quantitative screen exposure data. In this work, we developed a novel sensor informatics framework that utilizes egocentric images from a wearable sensor, termed the screen time tracker (STT), and a vision language model (VLM). In particular, we devised a multi-view VLM that takes multiple views from egocentric image sequences and interprets screen exposure dynamically. We validated our approach by using a dataset of children's free-living activities, demonstrating significant improvement over existing methods in plain vision language models and object detection models. Results supported the promise of this monitoring approach, which could optimize behavioral research on screen exposure in children's naturalistic settings.</description>

      <title>Efficient Diffusion as Low Light Enhancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational burden of the iterative sampling process remains a major challenge in diffusion-based Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE). Current acceleration methods, whether training-based or training-free, often lead to significant performance degradation, highlighting the trade-off between performance and efficiency. In this paper, we identify two primary factors contributing to performance degradation: fitting errors and the inference gap. Our key insight is that fitting errors can be mitigated by linearly extrapolating the incorrect score functions, while the inference gap can be reduced by shifting the Gaussian flow to a reflectance-aware residual space. Based on the above insights, we design Reflectance-Aware Trajectory Refinement (RATR) module, a simple yet effective module to refine the teacher trajectory using the reflectance component of images. Following this, we introduce \textbf{Re}flectance-aware \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{Di}stilled \textbf{T}rajectory (\textbf{ReDDiT}), an efficient and flexible distillation framework tailored for LLIE. Our framework achieves comparable performance to previous diffusion-based methods with redundant steps in just 2 steps while establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with 8 or 4 steps.

      <title>Lightweight Frequency Masker for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to first pre-train the model on a large-scale source-domain dataset, and then transfer the model to data-scarce target-domain datasets for pixel-level segmentation. The significant domain gap between the source and target datasets leads to a sharp decline in the performance of existing few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods in cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we discover an intriguing phenomenon: simply filtering different frequency components for target domains can lead to a significant performance improvement, sometimes even as high as 14% mIoU. Then, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation, and find such improvements stem from the reduced inter-channel correlation in feature maps, which benefits CD-FSS with enhanced robustness against domain gaps and larger activated regions for segmentation. Based on this, we propose a lightweight frequency masker, which further reduces channel correlations by an Amplitude-Phase Masker (APM) module and an Adaptive Channel Phase Attention (ACPA) module. Notably, APM introduces only 0.01% additional parameters but improves the average performance by over 10%, and ACPA imports only 2.5% parameters but further improves the performance by over 1.5%, which significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art CD-FSS methods.</description>

      <title>PointRecon: Online Point-based 3D Reconstruction via Ray-based 2D-3D Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel online, point-based 3D reconstruction method from posed monocular RGB videos. Our model maintains a global point cloud representation of the scene, continuously updating the features and 3D locations of points as new images are observed. It expands the point cloud with newly detected points while carefully removing redundancies. The point cloud updates and the depth predictions for new points are achieved through a novel ray-based 2D-3D feature matching technique, which is robust against errors in previous point position predictions. In contrast to offline methods, our approach processes infinite-length sequences and provides real-time updates. Additionally, the point cloud imposes no pre-defined resolution or scene size constraints, and its unified global representation ensures view consistency across perspectives. Experiments on the ScanNet dataset show that our method achieves comparable quality among online MVS approaches. Project page: https://arthurhero.github.io/projects/pointrecon</description>

      <title>Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting for Few-Shot Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, the 3DGS model tends to overfit when trained with sparse posed views, limiting its generalization ability to novel views. In this paper, we alleviate the overfitting problem, presenting a Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS) approach. Our method encompasses a $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and a $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model. The $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model serves as an ensemble of 3DGS models that generates novel-view images during inference. We achieve the self-ensembling by introducing an uncertainty-aware perturbation strategy at the training state. We complement the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model with the $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model, which is dynamically perturbed based on the uncertainties of novel-view renderings across different training steps. The perturbation yields diverse temporal samples in the Gaussian parameter space without additional training costs. The geometry of the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model is regularized by penalizing discrepancies between the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and these temporal samples. Therefore, our SE-GS conducts an effective and efficient regularization across a large number of 3DGS models, resulting in a robust ensemble, the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model. Our experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets show that our approach improves NVS quality with few-shot training views, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>TIPO: Text to Image with Text Presampling for Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TIPO (Text to Image with text pre-sampling for Prompt Optimization) is an innovative framework designed to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation by language model (LM) for automatic prompt engineering. By refining and extending user-provided prompts, TIPO bridges the gap between simple inputs and the detailed prompts required for high-quality image generation. Unlike previous approaches that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO adjusts user input prompts with the distribution of a trained prompt dataset, eliminating the need for complex runtime cost via lightweight model. This pre-sampling approach enables efficient and scalable prompt optimization, grounded in the model's training distribution. Experimental results demonstrate TIPO's effectiveness in improving aesthetic scores, reducing image corruption, and better aligning generated images with dataset distributions. These findings highlight the critical role of prompt engineering in T2I systems and open avenues for broader applications of automatic prompt refinement.</description>

      <title>BillBoard Splatting (BBSplat): Learnable Textured Primitives for Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present billboard Splatting (BBSplat) - a novel approach for 3D scene representation based on textured geometric primitives. BBSplat represents the scene as a set of optimizable textured planar primitives with learnable RGB textures and alpha-maps to control their shape. BBSplat primitives can be used in any Gaussian Splatting pipeline as drop-in replacements for Gaussians. Our method's qualitative and quantitative improvements over 3D and 2D Gaussians are most noticeable when fewer primitives are used, when BBSplat achieves over 1200 FPS. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, unlocking an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in storage space of the model. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&amp;Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360. We demonstrate improvements on PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics compared to the state-of-the-art, especially for the case when fewer primitives are used, which, on the other hand, leads to up to 2 times inference speed improvement for the same rendering quality.</description>

      <title>Saliency Map-based Image Retrieval using Invariant Krawtchouk Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of digital devices equipped with cameras and the rapid development of Internet technology, numerous content-based image retrieval systems and novel image feature extraction techniques have emerged in recent years. This paper introduces a saliency map-based image retrieval approach using invariant Krawtchouk moments (SM-IKM) to enhance retrieval speed and accuracy. The proposed method applies a global contrast-based salient region detection algorithm to create a saliency map that effectively isolates the foreground from the background. It then combines multiple orders of invariant Krawtchouk moments (IKM) with local binary patterns (LBPs) and color histograms to comprehensively represent the foreground and background. Additionally, it incorporates LBPs derived from the saliency map to improve discriminative power, facilitating more precise image differentiation. A bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) model is employed to generate a codebook for classification and discrimination. By using compact IKMs in the BoVW framework and integrating a range of region-based feature-including color histograms, LBPs, and saliency map-enhanced LBPs, our proposed SM-IKM achieves efficient and accurate image retrieval. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, such as Caltech 101 and Wang, demonstrate that SM-IKM outperforms recent state-of-the-art retrieval methods. The source code for SM-IKM is available at github.com/arnejad/SMIKM.</description>

      <title>Improving the accuracy of automated labeling of specimen images datasets via a confidence-based process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The digitization of natural history collections over the past three decades has unlocked a treasure trove of specimen imagery and metadata. There is great interest in making this data more useful by further labeling it with additional trait data, and modern deep learning machine learning techniques utilizing convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and similar networks show particular promise to reduce the amount of required manual labeling by human experts, making the process much faster and less expensive. However, in most cases, the accuracy of these approaches is too low for reliable utilization of the automatic labeling, typically in the range of 80-85% accuracy. In this paper, we present and validate an approach that can greatly improve this accuracy, essentially by examining the confidence that the network has in the generated label as well as utilizing a user-defined threshold to reject labels that fall below a chosen level. We demonstrate that a naive model that produced 86% initial accuracy can achieve improved performance - over 95% accuracy (rejecting about 40% of the labels) or over 99% accuracy (rejecting about 65%) by selecting higher confidence thresholds. This gives flexibility to adapt existing models to the statistical requirements of various types of research and has the potential to move these automatic labeling approaches from being unusably inaccurate to being an invaluable new tool. After validating the approach in a number of ways, we annotate the reproductive state of a large dataset of over 600,000 herbarium specimens. The analysis of the results points at under-investigated correlations as well as general alignment with known trends. By sharing this new dataset alongside this work, we want to allow ecologists to gather insights for their own research questions, at their chosen point of accuracy/coverage trade-off.</description>

      <title>FitDiT: Advancing the Authentic Garment Details for High-fidelity Virtual Try-on</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although image-based virtual try-on has made considerable progress, emerging approaches still encounter challenges in producing high-fidelity and robust fitting images across diverse scenarios. These methods often struggle with issues such as texture-aware maintenance and size-aware fitting, which hinder their overall effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel garment perception enhancement technique, termed FitDiT, designed for high-fidelity virtual try-on using Diffusion Transformers (DiT) allocating more parameters and attention to high-resolution features. First, to further improve texture-aware maintenance, we introduce a garment texture extractor that incorporates garment priors evolution to fine-tune garment feature, facilitating to better capture rich details such as stripes, patterns, and text. Additionally, we introduce frequency-domain learning by customizing a frequency distance loss to enhance high-frequency garment details. To tackle the size-aware fitting issue, we employ a dilated-relaxed mask strategy that adapts to the correct length of garments, preventing the generation of garments that fill the entire mask area during cross-category try-on. Equipped with the above design, FitDiT surpasses all baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. It excels in producing well-fitting garments with photorealistic and intricate details, while also achieving competitive inference times of 4.57 seconds for a single 1024x768 image after DiT structure slimming, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>TDSM: Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching in Zero-Shot Action Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We firstly present a diffusion-based action recognition with zero-shot learning for skeleton inputs. In zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, aligning skeleton features with the text features of action labels is essential for accurately predicting unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment between skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these spaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated from the remarkable performance of text-to-image diffusion models, we leverage their alignment capabilities between different modalities mostly by focusing on the training process during reverse diffusion rather than using their generative power. Based on this, our framework is designed as a Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM) method which aligns skeleton features with text prompts through reverse diffusion, embedding the prompts into the unified skeleton-text latent space to achieve robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a novel triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing apart incorrect ones. Our TDSM significantly outperforms the very recent state-of-the-art methods with large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through effective skeleton-text matching.</description>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) is one of the most promising novel 3D representations that has received great interest in computer graphics and computer vision. While various systems have introduced editing capabilities for 3D GS, such as those guided by text prompts, fine-grained control over deformation remains an open challenge. In this work, we present a novel sketch-guided 3D GS deformation system that allows users to intuitively modify the geometry of a 3D GS model by drawing a silhouette sketch from a single viewpoint. Our approach introduces a new deformation method that combines cage-based deformations with a variant of Neural Jacobian Fields, enabling precise, fine-grained control. Additionally, it leverages large-scale 2D diffusion priors and ControlNet to ensure the generated deformations are semantically plausible. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and showcase its ability to animate static 3D GS models as one of its key applications.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Lossless Image Compression: Next-Pixel Prediction in Language Space is All You Need</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have recently witnessed that ``Intelligence" and `` Compression" are the two sides of the same coin, where the language large model (LLM) with unprecedented intelligence is a general-purpose lossless compressor for various data modalities. This attribute particularly appeals to the lossless image compression community, given the increasing need to compress high-resolution images in the current streaming media era. Consequently, a spontaneous envision emerges: Can the compression performance of the LLM elevate lossless image compression to new heights? However, our findings indicate that the naive application of LLM-based lossless image compressors suffers from a considerable performance gap compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) codecs on common benchmark datasets. In light of this, we are dedicated to fulfilling the unprecedented intelligence (compression) capacity of the LLM for lossless image compression tasks, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical and practical compression performance. Specifically, we propose P$^{2}$-LLM, a next-pixel prediction-based LLM, which integrates various elaborated insights and methodologies, \textit{e.g.,} pixel-level priors, the in-context ability of LLM, and a pixel-level semantic preservation strategy, to enhance the understanding capacity of pixel sequences for better next-pixel predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that P$^{2}$-LLM can beat SOTA classical and learned codecs.</description>

      <title>STREAM: A Universal State-Space Model for Sparse Geometric Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Handling sparse and unstructured geometric data, such as point clouds or event-based vision, is a pressing challenge in the field of machine vision. Recently, sequence models such as Transformers and state-space models entered the domain of geometric data. These methods require specialized preprocessing to create a sequential view of a set of points. Furthermore, prior works involving sequence models iterate geometric data with either uniform or learned step sizes, implicitly relying on the model to infer the underlying geometric structure. In this work, we propose to encode geometric structure explicitly into the parameterization of a state-space model. State-space models are based on linear dynamics governed by a one-dimensional variable such as time or a spatial coordinate. We exploit this dynamic variable to inject relative differences of coordinates into the step size of the state-space model. The resulting geometric operation computes interactions between all pairs of N points in O(N) steps. Our model deploys the Mamba selective state-space model with a modified CUDA kernel to efficiently map sparse geometric data to modern hardware. The resulting sequence model, which we call STREAM, achieves competitive results on a range of benchmarks from point-cloud classification to event-based vision and audio classification. STREAM demonstrates a powerful inductive bias for sparse geometric data by improving the PointMamba baseline when trained from scratch on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN point cloud analysis datasets. It further achieves, for the first time, 100% test accuracy on all 11 classes of the DVS128 Gestures dataset.</description>

      <title>Maps from Motion (MfM): Generating 2D Semantic Maps from Sparse Multi-view Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: World-wide detailed 2D maps require enormous collective efforts. OpenStreetMap is the result of 11 million registered users manually annotating the GPS location of over 1.75 billion entries, including distinctive landmarks and common urban objects. At the same time, manual annotations can include errors and are slow to update, limiting the map's accuracy. Maps from Motion (MfM) is a step forward to automatize such time-consuming map making procedure by computing 2D maps of semantic objects directly from a collection of uncalibrated multi-view images. From each image, we extract a set of object detections, and estimate their spatial arrangement in a top-down local map centered in the reference frame of the camera that captured the image. Aligning these local maps is not a trivial problem, since they provide incomplete, noisy fragments of the scene, and matching detections across them is unreliable because of the presence of repeated pattern and the limited appearance variability of urban objects. We address this with a novel graph-based framework, that encodes the spatial and semantic distribution of the objects detected in each image, and learns how to combine them to predict the objects' poses in a global reference system, while taking into account all possible detection matches and preserving the topology observed in each image. Despite the complexity of the problem, our best model achieves global 2D registration with an average accuracy within 4 meters (i.e., below GPS accuracy) even on sparse sequences with strong viewpoint change, on which COLMAP has an 80% failure rate. We provide extensive evaluation on synthetic and real-world data, showing how the method obtains a solution even in scenarios where standard optimization techniques fail.</description>

      <title>From Text to Pose to Image: Improving Diffusion Model Control and Quality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last two years, text-to-image diffusion models have become extremely popular. As their quality and usage increase, a major concern has been the need for better output control. In addition to prompt engineering, one effective method to improve the controllability of diffusion models has been to condition them on additional modalities such as image style, depth map, or keypoints. This forms the basis of ControlNets or Adapters. When attempting to apply these methods to control human poses in outputs of text-to-image diffusion models, two main challenges have arisen. The first challenge is generating poses following a wide range of semantic text descriptions, for which previous methods involved searching for a pose within a dataset of (caption, pose) pairs. The second challenge is conditioning image generation on a specified pose while keeping both high aesthetic and high pose fidelity. In this article, we fix these two main issues by introducing a text-to-pose (T2P) generative model alongside a new sampling algorithm, and a new pose adapter that incorporates more pose keypoints for higher pose fidelity. Together, these two new state-of-the-art models enable, for the first time, a generative text-to-pose-to-image framework for higher pose control in diffusion models. We release all models and the code used for the experiments at https://github.com/clement-bonnet/text-to-pose.</description>

      <title>GraphCL: Graph-based Clustering for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has made notable advancements in medical image segmentation (MIS), particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data and significantly enhancing data utilization efficiency. Previous methods primarily focus on complex training strategies to utilize unlabeled data but neglect the importance of graph structural information. Different from existing methods, we propose a graph-based clustering for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (GraphCL) by jointly modeling graph data structure in a unified deep model. The proposed GraphCL model enjoys several advantages. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model the data structure information for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS). Secondly, to get the clustered features across different graphs, we integrate both pairwise affinities between local image features and raw features as inputs. Extensive experimental results on three standard benchmarks show that the proposed GraphCL algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods.</description>

      <title>AGLP: A Graph Learning Perspective for Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA), the model aims to leverage partially labeled target domain data along with a large amount of labeled source domain data to enhance its generalization capability for the target domain. A key advantage of SSDA is its ability to significantly reduce reliance on labeled data, thereby lowering the costs and time associated with data preparation. Most existing SSDA methods utilize information from domain labels and class labels but overlook the structural information of the data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a graph learning perspective (AGLP) for semi-supervised domain adaptation. We apply the graph convolutional network to the instance graph which allows structural information to propagate along the weighted graph edges. The proposed AGLP model has several advantages. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model structural information in SSDA. Second, the proposed model can effectively learn domain-invariant and semantic representations, reducing domain discrepancies in SSDA. Extensive experimental results on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed AGLP algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscopy structure segmentation, such as detecting cells or nuclei, generally requires a human to draw a ground truth contour around each instance. Weakly supervised approaches (e.g. consisting of only single point labels) have the potential to reduce this workload significantly. Our approach uses individual point labels for an entropy estimation to approximate an underlying distribution of cell pixels. We infer full cell masks from this distribution, and use Mask-RCNN to produce an instance segmentation output. We compare this point--annotated approach with training on the full ground truth masks. We show that our method achieves a comparatively good level of performance, despite a 95% reduction in pixel labels.</description>

      <title>Panther: Illuminate the Sight of Multimodal LLMs with Instruction-Guided Visual Prompts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are closing the gap to human visual perception capability rapidly, while, still lag behind on attending to subtle images details or locating small objects precisely, etc. Common schemes to tackle these issues include deploying multiple vision encoders or operating on original high-resolution images. Few studies have concentrated on taking the textual instruction into improving visual representation, resulting in losing focus in some vision-centric tasks, a phenomenon we herein termed as Amblyopia. In this work, we introduce Panther, a MLLM that closely adheres to user instruction and locates targets of interests precisely, with the finesse of a black panther. Specifically, Panther comprises three integral components: Panther-VE, Panther-Bridge, and Panther-Decoder. Panther-VE integrates user instruction information at the early stages of the vision encoder, thereby extracting the most relevant and useful visual representations. The Panther-Bridge module, equipped with powerful filtering capabilities, significantly reduces redundant visual information, leading to a substantial savings in training costs. The Panther-Decoder is versatile and can be employed with any decoder-only architecture of LLMs without discrimination. Experimental results, particularly on vision-centric benchmarks, have demonstrated the effectiveness of Panther.</description>

      <title>Quantization without Tears</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks, while achieving remarkable success across diverse tasks, demand significant resources, including computation, GPU memory, bandwidth, storage, and energy. Network quantization, as a standard compression and acceleration technique, reduces storage costs and enables potential inference acceleration by discretizing network weights and activations into a finite set of integer values. However, current quantization methods are often complex and sensitive, requiring extensive task-specific hyperparameters, where even a single misconfiguration can impair model performance, limiting generality across different models and tasks. In this paper, we propose Quantization without Tears (QwT), a method that simultaneously achieves quantization speed, accuracy, simplicity, and generality. The key insight of QwT is to incorporate a lightweight additional structure into the quantized network to mitigate information loss during quantization. This structure consists solely of a small set of linear layers, keeping the method simple and efficient. More importantly, it provides a closed-form solution, allowing us to improve accuracy effortlessly under 2 minutes. Extensive experiments across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks demonstrate that QwT is both highly effective and versatile. In fact, our approach offers a robust solution for network quantization that combines simplicity, accuracy, and adaptability, which provides new insights for the design of novel quantization paradigms.</description>

      <title>Deep ReLU Networks Have Surprisingly Simple Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A ReLU network is a piecewise linear function over polytopes. Figuring out the properties of such polytopes is of fundamental importance for the research and development of neural networks. So far, either theoretical or empirical studies on polytopes only stay at the level of counting their number, which is far from a complete characterization. Here, we propose to study the shapes of polytopes via the number of faces of the polytope. Then, by computing and analyzing the histogram of faces across polytopes, we find that a ReLU network has relatively simple polytopes under both initialization and gradient descent, although these polytopes can be rather diverse and complicated by a specific design. This finding can be appreciated as a kind of generalized implicit bias, subjected to the intrinsic geometric constraint in space partition of a ReLU network. Next, we perform a combinatorial analysis to explain why adding depth does not generate a more complicated polytope by bounding the average number of faces of polytopes with the dimensionality. Our results concretely reveal what kind of simple functions a network learns and what will happen when a network goes deep. Also, by characterizing the shape of polytopes, the number of faces can be a novel leverage for other problems, \textit{e.g.}, serving as a generic tool to explain the power of popular shortcut networks such as ResNet and analyzing the impact of different regularization strategies on a network's space partition.</description>

      <title>GuideGen: A Text-Guided Framework for Full-torso Anatomy and CT Volume Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently emerging conditional diffusion models seem promising for mitigating the labor and expenses in building large 3D medical imaging datasets. However, previous studies on 3D CT generation have yet to fully capitalize on semantic and textual conditions, and they have primarily focused on specific organs characterized by a local structure and fixed contrast. In this work, we present GuideGen, a controllable framework that generates anatomical masks and corresponding CT volumes for the entire torso-from chest to pelvis-based on free-form text prompts. Our approach includes three core components: a text-conditional semantic synthesizer for creating realistic full-torso anatomies; a contrast-aware autoencoder for detailed, high-fidelity feature extraction across varying contrast levels; and a latent feature generator that ensures alignment between CT images, anatomical semantics and input prompts. To train and evaluate GuideGen, we compile a multi-modality cancer imaging dataset with paired CT and clinical descriptions from 12 public TCIA datasets and one private real-world dataset. Comprehensive evaluations across generation quality, cross-modality alignment, and data usability on multi-organ and tumor segmentation tasks demonstrate GuideGen's superiority over existing CT generation methods.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Alignment for Medical Federated Vision-Language Pre-training Under Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has emerged as an effective scheme for multimodal representation learning, but its reliance on large-scale multimodal data poses significant challenges for medical applications. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution to scale up the dataset for medical VLP while preserving data privacy. However, we observe that client data heterogeneity in real-world scenarios could cause models to learn biased cross-modal alignment during local pre-training. This would limit the transferability of the federally learned representation model on downstream tasks. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Distributionally Robust Alignment (FedDRA), a framework for federated VLP that achieves robust vision-language alignment under heterogeneous conditions. Based on client datasets, we construct a distribution family that encompasses potential test-time domains, and apply a distributionally robust framework to optimize the pre-trained model's performance across this distribution space. This approach bridges the gap between pre-training samples and downstream applications. To avoid over-fitting on client-specific information, we use anchor representation from the global model to guide the local training, and adopt a two-stage approach to first tune deeper layers before updating the entire network. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDRA's effectiveness in enhancing medical federated VLP under data heterogeneity. Our method also adapts well to various medical pre-training methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Branch Generative Models for Multichannel Imaging with an Application to PET/CT Synergistic Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for learned synergistic reconstruction of medical images using multi-branch generative models. Leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs), our model learns from pairs of images simultaneously, enabling effective denoising and reconstruction. Synergistic image reconstruction is achieved by incorporating the trained models in a regularizer that evaluates the distance between the images and the model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) datasets, showcasing improved image quality for low-dose imaging. Despite challenges such as patch decomposition and model limitations, our results underscore the potential of generative models for enhancing medical imaging reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical localization with panoramic views and triplet loss functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to tackle visual localization, which is essential for the safe navigation of mobile robots. The solution we propose employs panoramic images and triplet convolutional neural networks. We seek to exploit the properties of such architectures to address both hierarchical and global localization in indoor environments, which are prone to visual aliasing and other phenomena. Considering their importance in these architectures, a complete comparative evaluation of different triplet loss functions is performed. The experimental section proves that triplet networks can be trained with a relatively low number of images captured under a specific lighting condition and even so, the resulting networks are a robust tool to perform visual localization under dynamic conditions. Our approach has been evaluated against some of these effects, such as changes in the lighting conditions, occlusions, noise and motion blurring. Furthermore, to explore the limits of our approach, triplet networks have been tested in different indoor environments simultaneously. In all the cases, these architectures have demonstrated a great capability to generalize to diverse and challenging scenarios. The code used in the experiments is available at https://github.com/MarcosAlfaro/TripletNetworksIndoorLocalization.git.</description>

      <title>UnMarker: A Universal Attack on Defensive Image Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reports regarding the misuse of Generative AI (GenAI) to create deepfakes are frequent. Defensive watermarking enables GenAI providers to hide fingerprints in their images and use them later for deepfake detection. Yet, its potential has not been fully explored. We present UnMarker -- the first practical universal attack on defensive watermarking. Unlike existing attacks, UnMarker requires no detector feedback, no unrealistic knowledge of the watermarking scheme or similar models, and no advanced denoising pipelines that may not be available. Instead, being the product of an in-depth analysis of the watermarking paradigm revealing that robust schemes must construct their watermarks in the spectral amplitudes, UnMarker employs two novel adversarial optimizations to disrupt the spectra of watermarked images, erasing the watermarks. Evaluations against SOTA schemes prove UnMarker's effectiveness. It not only defeats traditional schemes while retaining superior quality compared to existing attacks but also breaks semantic watermarks that alter an image's structure, reducing the best detection rate to $43\%$ and rendering them useless. To our knowledge, UnMarker is the first practical attack on semantic watermarks, which have been deemed the future of defensive watermarking. Our findings show that defensive watermarking is not a viable defense against deepfakes, and we urge the community to explore alternatives.</description>

      <title>Constrained Diffusion Models via Dual Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have attained prominence for their ability to synthesize a probability distribution for a given dataset via a diffusion process, enabling the generation of new data points with high fidelity. However, diffusion processes are prone to generating samples that reflect biases in a training dataset. To address this issue, we develop constrained diffusion models by imposing diffusion constraints based on desired distributions that are informed by requirements. Specifically, we cast the training of diffusion models under requirements as a constrained distribution optimization problem that aims to reduce the distribution difference between original and generated data while obeying constraints on the distribution of generated data. We show that our constrained diffusion models generate new data from a mixture data distribution that achieves the optimal trade-off among objective and constraints. To train constrained diffusion models, we develop a dual training algorithm and characterize the optimality of the trained constrained diffusion model. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our constrained models in two constrained generation tasks: (i) we consider a dataset with one or more underrepresented classes where we train the model with constraints to ensure fairly sampling from all classes during inference; (ii) we fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model to sample from a new dataset while avoiding overfitting.</description>

      <title>Data Diet: Can Trimming PET/CT Datasets Enhance Lesion Segmentation?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13548v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we describe our approach to compete in the autoPET3 datacentric track. While conventional wisdom suggests that larger datasets lead to better model performance, recent studies indicate that excluding certain training samples can enhance model accuracy. We find that in the autoPETIII dataset, a model that is trained on the entire dataset exhibits undesirable characteristics by producing a large number of false positives particularly for PSMA-PETs. We counteract this by removing the easiest samples from the training dataset as measured by the model loss before retraining from scratch. Using the proposed approach we manage to drive down the false negative volume and improve upon the baseline model in both false negative volume and dice score on the preliminary test set. Code and pre-trained models are available at github.com/alexanderjaus/autopet3_datadiet.</description>

      <title>Unveil Benign Overfitting for Transformer in Vision: Training Dynamics, Convergence, and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated great power in the recent development of large foundational models. In particular, the Vision Transformer (ViT) has brought revolutionary changes to the field of vision, achieving significant accomplishments on the experimental side. However, their theoretical capabilities, particularly in terms of generalization when trained to overfit training data, are still not fully understood. To address this gap, this work delves deeply into the benign overfitting perspective of transformers in vision. To this end, we study the optimization of a Transformer composed of a self-attention layer with softmax followed by a fully connected layer under gradient descent on a certain data distribution model. By developing techniques that address the challenges posed by softmax and the interdependent nature of multiple weights in transformer optimization, we successfully characterized the training dynamics and achieved generalization in post-training. Our results establish a sharp condition that can distinguish between the small test error phase and the large test error regime, based on the signal-to-noise ratio in the data model. The theoretical results are further verified by experimental simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to characterize benign overfitting for Transformers.</description>

      <title>Controlling Language and Diffusion Models by Transporting Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23054</link>

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of large generative models and their ever more widespread deployment have raised concerns about their reliability, safety, and potential misuse. To address these issues, recent works have proposed to control model generation by steering model activations in order to effectively induce or prevent the emergence of concepts or behaviors in the generated output. In this paper we introduce Activation Transport (AcT), a general framework to steer activations guided by optimal transport theory that generalizes many previous activation-steering works. AcT is modality-agnostic and provides fine-grained control over the model behavior with negligible computational overhead, while minimally impacting model abilities. We experimentally show the effectiveness and versatility of our approach by addressing key challenges in large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models (T2Is). For LLMs, we show that AcT can effectively mitigate toxicity, induce arbitrary concepts, and increase their truthfulness. In T2Is, we show how AcT enables fine-grained style control and concept negation.</description>

      <title>Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24060v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Sketched Equivariant Imaging Regularization and Deep Internal Learning for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We then extend our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework -- Sketched Equivariant Deep Image Prior (Sk-EI-DIP), which can be efficiently applied for single-image and task-adapted reconstruction. Additionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient approach for accelerating both EI-DIP and Sk-EI-DIP via optimizing only the normalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve order-of-magnitude computational acceleration over standard EI-based counterpart in single-input setting, and network adaptation at test time.</description>

      <title>HistoEncoder: a digital pathology foundation model for prostate cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are trained on massive amounts of data to distinguish complex patterns and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks with minimal computational resources. Here, we develop a foundation model for prostate cancer digital pathology called HistoEncoder by pre-training on 48 million prostate tissue tile images. We demonstrate that HistoEncoder features extracted from tile images with similar histological patterns map closely together in the feature space. HistoEncoder outperforms models pre-trained with natural images, even without fine-tuning or with 1000 times less training data. We describe two use cases that leverage the capabilities of HistoEncoder by fine-tuning the model with a limited amount of data and computational resources. First, we show how HistoEncoder can be used to automatically annotate large-scale datasets with high accuracy. Second, we combine histomics with commonly used clinical nomograms, significantly improving prostate cancer-specific death survival models. Foundation models such as HistoEncoder can allow organizations with limited resources to build effective clinical software tools without needing extensive datasets or significant amounts of computing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Brain Imaging Analysis for Alzheimer's and Dementia Detection Using Convolution-Derivative Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and results in detrimental structural changes in human brains. Detecting these changes is crucial for early diagnosis and timely intervention of disease progression. Jacobian maps, derived from spatial normalization in voxel-based morphometry (VBM), have been instrumental in interpreting volume alterations associated with AD. However, the computational cost of generating Jacobian maps limits its clinical adoption. In this study, we explore alternative methods and propose Sobel kernel angle difference (SKAD) as a computationally efficient alternative. SKAD is a derivative operation that offers an optimized approach to quantifying volumetric alterations through localized analysis of the gradients. By efficiently extracting gradient amplitude changes at critical spatial regions, this derivative operation captures regional volume variations Evaluation of SKAD over various medical datasets demonstrates that it is 6.3x faster than Jacobian maps while still maintaining comparable accuracy. This makes it an efficient and competitive approach in neuroimaging research and clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning for radio-astronomy source classification: a benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) telescope marks a significant step forward in radio astronomy, presenting new opportunities and challenges for data analysis. Traditional visual models pretrained on optical photography images may not perform optimally on radio interferometry images, which have distinct visual characteristics.
  Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising approach to address this issue, leveraging the abundant unlabeled data in radio astronomy to train neural networks that learn useful representations from radio images. This study explores the application of SSL to radio astronomy, comparing the performance of SSL-trained models with that of traditional models pretrained on natural images, evaluating the importance of data curation for SSL, and assessing the potential benefits of self-supervision to different domain-specific radio astronomy datasets.
  Our results indicate that, SSL-trained models achieve significant improvements over the baseline in several downstream tasks, especially in the linear evaluation setting; when the entire backbone is fine-tuned, the benefits of SSL are less evident but still outperform pretraining. These findings suggest that SSL can play a valuable role in efficiently enhancing the analysis of radio astronomical data.

      <title>Adversarial Poisoning Attack on Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and the increasing availability of quantum computers through cloud providers, addressing the potential security risks associated with QML has become an urgent priority. One key concern in the QML domain is the threat of data poisoning attacks in the current quantum cloud setting. Adversarial access to training data could severely compromise the integrity and availability of QML models. Classical data poisoning techniques require significant knowledge and training to generate poisoned data, and lack noise resilience, making them ineffective for QML models in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we first propose a simple yet effective technique to measure intra-class encoder state similarity (ESS) by analyzing the outputs of encoding circuits. Leveraging this approach, we introduce a quantum indiscriminate data poisoning attack, QUID. Through extensive experiments conducted in both noiseless and noisy environments (e.g., IBM\_Brisbane's noise), across various architectures and datasets, QUID achieves up to $92\%$ accuracy degradation in model performance compared to baseline models and up to $75\%$ accuracy degradation compared to random label-flipping. We also tested QUID against state-of-the-art classical defenses, with accuracy degradation still exceeding $50\%$, demonstrating its effectiveness. This work represents the first attempt to reevaluate data poisoning attacks in the context of QML.</description>
