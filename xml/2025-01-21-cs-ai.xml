      <title>Exploring the Implementation of AI in Early Onset Interviews to Help Mitigate Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in early-stage recruitment interviews in order to reduce inherent bias, specifically sentiment bias. Traditional interviewers are often subject to several biases, including interviewer bias, social desirability effects, and even confirmation bias. In turn, this leads to non-inclusive hiring practices, and a less diverse workforce. This study further analyzes various AI interventions that are present in the marketplace today such as multimodal platforms and interactive candidate assessment tools in order to gauge the current market usage of AI in early-stage recruitment. However, this paper aims to use a unique AI system that was developed to transcribe and analyze interview dynamics, which emphasize skill and knowledge over emotional sentiments. Results indicate that AI effectively minimizes sentiment-driven biases by 41.2%, suggesting its revolutionizing power in companies' recruitment processes for improved equity and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Evolving Deeper LLM Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an evolutionary search strategy for scaling inference time compute in Large Language Models. The proposed approach, Mind Evolution, uses a language model to generate, recombine and refine candidate responses. The proposed approach avoids the need to formalize the underlying inference problem whenever a solution evaluator is available. Controlling for inference cost, we find that Mind Evolution significantly outperforms other inference strategies such as Best-of-N and Sequential Revision in natural language planning tasks. In the TravelPlanner and Natural Plan benchmarks, Mind Evolution solves more than 98% of the problem instances using Gemini 1.5 Pro without the use of a formal solver.</description>

      <title>Towards A Litmus Test for Common Sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a planned series aimed at envisioning a path to safe and beneficial artificial intelligence. Building on the conceptual insights of "Common Sense Is All You Need," we propose a more formal litmus test for common sense, adopting an axiomatic approach that combines minimal prior knowledge (MPK) constraints with diagonal or Godel-style arguments to create tasks beyond the agent's known concept set. We discuss how this approach applies to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), acknowledging training/test data constraints, physical or virtual embodiment, and large language models (LLMs). We also integrate observations regarding emergent deceptive hallucinations, in which more capable AI systems may intentionally fabricate plausible yet misleading outputs to disguise knowledge gaps. The overarching theme is that scaling AI without ensuring common sense risks intensifying such deceptive tendencies, thereby undermining safety and trust. Aligning with the broader goal of developing beneficial AI without causing harm, our axiomatic litmus test not only diagnoses whether an AI can handle truly novel concepts but also provides a stepping stone toward an ethical, reliable foundation for future safe, beneficial, and aligned artificial intelligence.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a prototyping testbed, GenSC-6G, developed to generate a comprehensive dataset that supports the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and semantic communication for emerging sixth-generation (6G) applications. The GenSC-6G dataset is designed with noise-augmented synthetic data optimized for semantic decoding, classification, and localization tasks, significantly enhancing flexibility for diverse AI-driven communication applications. This adaptable prototype supports seamless modifications across baseline models, communication modules, and goal-oriented decoders. Case studies demonstrate its application in lightweight classification, semantic upsampling, and edge-based language inference under noise conditions. The GenSC-6G dataset serves as a scalable and robust resource for developing goal-oriented communication systems tailored to the growing demands of 6G networks.</description>

      <title>ForestProtector: An IoT Architecture Integrating Machine Vision and Deep Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Wildfire Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of forest fires is crucial to minimizing the environmental and socioeconomic damage they cause. Indeed, a fire's duration directly correlates with the difficulty and cost of extinguishing it. For instance, a fire burning for 1 minute might require 1 liter of water to extinguish, while a 2-minute fire could demand 100 liters, and a 10-minute fire might necessitate 1,000 liters. On the other hand, existing fire detection systems based on novel technologies (e.g., remote sensing, PTZ cameras, UAVs) are often expensive and require human intervention, making continuous monitoring of large areas impractical. To address this challenge, this work proposes a low-cost forest fire detection system that utilizes a central gateway device with computer vision capabilities to monitor a 360{\deg} field of view for smoke at long distances. A deep reinforcement learning agent enhances surveillance by dynamically controlling the camera's orientation, leveraging real-time sensor data (smoke levels, ambient temperature, and humidity) from distributed IoT devices. This approach enables automated wildfire monitoring across expansive areas while reducing false positives.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Crash Frequency Modeling Based on Augmented Multi-Type Data by Hybrid VAE-Diffusion-Based Generative Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crash frequency modelling analyzes the impact of factors like traffic volume, road geometry, and environmental conditions on crash occurrences. Inaccurate predictions can distort our understanding of these factors, leading to misguided policies and wasted resources, which jeopardize traffic safety. A key challenge in crash frequency modelling is the prevalence of excessive zero observations, caused by underreporting, the low probability of crashes, and high data collection costs. These zero observations often reduce model accuracy and introduce bias, complicating safety decision making. While existing approaches, such as statistical methods, data aggregation, and resampling, attempt to address this issue, they either rely on restrictive assumptions or result in significant information loss, distorting crash data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid VAE-Diffusion neural network, designed to reduce zero observations and handle the complexities of multi-type tabular crash data (count, ordinal, nominal, and real-valued variables). We assess the synthetic data quality generated by this model through metrics like similarity, accuracy, diversity, and structural consistency, and compare its predictive performance against traditional statistical models. Our findings demonstrate that the hybrid VAE-Diffusion model outperforms baseline models across all metrics, offering a more effective approach to augmenting crash data and improving the accuracy of crash frequency predictions. This study highlights the potential of synthetic data to enhance traffic safety by improving crash frequency modelling and informing better policy decisions.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Prediction of Secondary Crashes by Rebalancing Dynamic and Static Data with Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data imbalance is a common issue in analyzing and predicting sudden traffic events. Secondary crashes constitute only a small proportion of all crashes. These secondary crashes, triggered by primary crashes, significantly exacerbate traffic congestion and increase the severity of incidents. However, the severe imbalance of secondary crash data poses significant challenges for prediction models, affecting their generalization ability and prediction accuracy. Existing methods fail to fully address the complexity of traffic crash data, particularly the coexistence of dynamic and static features, and often struggle to effectively handle data samples of varying lengths. Furthermore, most current studies predict the occurrence probability and spatiotemporal distribution of secondary crashes separately, lacking an integrated solution. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid model named VarFusiGAN-Transformer, aimed at improving the fidelity of secondary crash data generation and jointly predicting the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of secondary crashes. The VarFusiGAN-Transformer model employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the generation of multivariate long-time series data, incorporating a static data generator and an auxiliary discriminator to model the joint distribution of dynamic and static features. In addition, the model's prediction module achieves simultaneous prediction of both the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of secondary crashes. Compared to existing methods, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance in generating high-fidelity data and improving prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>AirRAG: Activating Intrinsic Reasoning for Retrieval Augmented Generation via Tree-based Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the autonomous decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) demonstrates superior performance in reasoning tasks. Despite the successes of iterative or recursive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), they often are trapped in a single solution space when confronted with complex tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel thinking pattern in RAG which integrates system analysis with efficient reasoning actions, significantly activating intrinsic reasoning capabilities and expanding the solution space of specific tasks via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), dubbed AirRAG. Specifically, our approach designs five fundamental reasoning actions that are expanded to a wide tree-based reasoning spaces using MCTS. The extension also uses self-consistency verification to explore potential reasoning paths and implement inference scaling. In addition, computationally optimal strategies are used to apply more inference computation to key actions to achieve further performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AirRAG through considerable performance gains over complex QA datasets. Furthermore, AirRAG is flexible and lightweight, making it easy to integrate with other advanced technologies.</description>

      <title>A Survey on LLM Test-Time Compute via Search: Tasks, LLM Profiling, Search Algorithms, and Relevant Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM test-time compute (or LLM inference) via search has emerged as a promising research area with rapid developments. However, current frameworks often adopt distinct perspectives on three key aspects (task definition, LLM profiling, and search procedures), making direct comparisons challenging. Moreover, the search algorithms employed often diverge from standard implementations, and their specific characteristics are not thoroughly specified. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive technical review that unifies task definitions and provides modular definitions of LLM profiling and search procedures. The definitions enable precise comparisons of various LLM inference frameworks while highlighting their departures from conventional search algorithms. We also discuss the applicability, performance, and efficiency of these methods.

      <title>LLM Reasoner and Automated Planner: A new NPC approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In domains requiring intelligent agents to emulate plausible human-like behaviour, such as formative simulations, traditional techniques like behaviour trees encounter significant challenges. Large Language Models (LLMs), despite not always yielding optimal solutions, usually offer plausible and human-like responses to a given problem. In this paper, we exploit this capability and propose a novel architecture that integrates an LLM for decision-making with a classical automated planner that can generate sound plans for that decision. The combination aims to equip an agent with the ability to make decisions in various situations, even if they were not anticipated during the design phase.</description>

      <title>Infrastructure for AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasingly many AI systems can plan and execute interactions in open-ended environments, such as making phone calls or buying online goods. As developers grow the space of tasks that such AI agents can accomplish, we will need tools both to unlock their benefits and manage their risks. Current tools are largely insufficient because they are not designed to shape how agents interact with existing institutions (e.g., legal and economic systems) or actors (e.g., digital service providers, humans, other AI agents). For example, alignment techniques by nature do not assure counterparties that some human will be held accountable when a user instructs an agent to perform an illegal action. To fill this gap, we propose the concept of agent infrastructure: technical systems and shared protocols external to agents that are designed to mediate and influence their interactions with and impacts on their environments. Agent infrastructure comprises both new tools and reconfigurations or extensions of existing tools. For example, to facilitate accountability, protocols that tie users to agents could build upon existing systems for user authentication, such as OpenID. Just as the Internet relies on infrastructure like HTTPS, we argue that agent infrastructure will be similarly indispensable to ecosystems of agents. We identify three functions for agent infrastructure: 1) attributing actions, properties, and other information to specific agents, their users, or other actors; 2) shaping agents' interactions; and 3) detecting and remedying harmful actions from agents. We propose infrastructure that could help achieve each function, explaining use cases, adoption, limitations, and open questions. Making progress on agent infrastructure can prepare society for the adoption of more advanced agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology have been transformative for the field of education. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Bard can be leveraged to automate boilerplate tasks, create content for personalised teaching, and handle repetitive tasks to allow more time for creative thinking. However, it is important to develop guidelines, policies, and assessment methods in the education sector to ensure the responsible integration of these tools. In this article, thematic analysis has been performed on seven essays obtained from professionals in the education sector to understand the advantages and pitfalls of using GenAI models such as ChatGPT and Bard in education. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has been performed on the essays to extract further insights from the text. The study found several themes which highlight benefits and drawbacks of GenAI tools, as well as suggestions to overcome these limitations and ensure that students are using these tools in a responsible and ethical manner.</description>

      <title>Topology-Driven Attribute Recovery for Attribute Missing Graph Learning in Social Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of information technology, the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) has fostered the integration of physical devices and social networks, deepening the study of complex interaction patterns. Text Attribute Graphs (TAGs) capture both topological structures and semantic attributes, enhancing the analysis of complex interactions within the SIoT. However, existing graph learning methods are typically designed for complete attributed graphs, and the common issue of missing attributes in Attribute Missing Graphs (AMGs) increases the difficulty of analysis tasks. To address this, we propose the Topology-Driven Attribute Recovery (TDAR) framework, which leverages topological data for AMG learning. TDAR introduces an improved pre-filling method for initial attribute recovery using native graph topology. Additionally, it dynamically adjusts propagation weights and incorporates homogeneity strategies within the embedding space to suit AMGs' unique topological structures, effectively reducing noise during information propagation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that TDAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attribute reconstruction and downstream tasks, offering a robust solution to the challenges posed by AMGs. The code is available at https://github.com/limengran98/TDAR.</description>

      <title>CSSDM Ontology to Enable Continuity of Care Data Interoperability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of digital technologies and recent global pandemic scenarios have led to a growing focus on how these technologies can enhance healthcare service delivery and workflow to address crises. Action plans that consolidate existing digital transformation programs are being reviewed to establish core infrastructure and foundations for sustainable healthcare solutions. Reforming health and social care to personalize home care, for example, can help avoid treatment in overcrowded acute hospital settings and improve the experiences and outcomes for both healthcare professionals and service users. In this information-intensive domain, addressing the interoperability challenge through standards-based roadmaps is crucial for enabling effective connections between health and social care services. This approach facilitates safe and trustworthy data workflows between different healthcare system providers. In this paper, we present a methodology for extracting, transforming, and loading data through a semi-automated process using a Common Semantic Standardized Data Model (CSSDM) to create personalized healthcare knowledge graph (KG). The CSSDM is grounded in the formal ontology of ISO 13940 ContSys and incorporates FHIR-based specifications to support structural attributes for generating KGs. We propose that the CSSDM facilitates data harmonization and linking, offering an alternative approach to interoperability. This approach promotes a novel form of collaboration between companies developing health information systems and cloud-enabled health services. Consequently, it provides multiple stakeholders with access to high-quality data and information sharing.</description>

Abstract: Generative AI has had a profound impact on biomedicine and health, both in professional work and in education. Based on large language models (LLMs), generative AI has been found to perform as well as humans in simulated situations taking medical board exams, answering clinical questions, solving clinical cases, applying clinical reasoning, and summarizing information. Generative AI is also being used widely in education, performing well in academic courses and their assessments. This review summarizes the successes of LLMs and highlights some of their challenges in the context of education, most notably aspects that may undermines the acquisition of knowledge and skills for professional work. It then provides recommendations for best practices overcoming shortcomings for LLM use in education. Although there are challenges for use of generative AI in education, all students and faculty, in biomedicine and health and beyond, must have understanding and be competent in its use.</description>

      <title>Temporal Causal Reasoning with (Non-Recursive) Structural Equation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural Equation Models (SEM) are the standard approach to representing causal dependencies between variables in causal models. In this paper we propose a new interpretation of SEMs when reasoning about Actual Causality, in which SEMs are viewed as mechanisms transforming the dynamics of exogenous variables into the dynamics of endogenous variables. This allows us to combine counterfactual causal reasoning with existing temporal logic formalisms, and to introduce a temporal logic, CPLTL, for causal reasoning about such structures. We show that the standard restriction to so-called \textit{recursive} models (with no cycles in the dependency graph) is not necessary in our approach, allowing us to reason about mutually dependent processes and feedback loops. Finally, we introduce new notions of model equivalence for temporal causal models, and show that CPLTL has an efficient model-checking procedure.</description>

      <title>An Ontology for Social Determinants of Education (SDoEd) based on Human-AI Collaborative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of computational ontologies is well-established in the field of Medical Informatics. The topic of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) has also received extensive attention. Work at the intersection of ontologies and SDoH has been published. However, a standardized framework for Social Determinants of Education (SDoEd) is lacking. In this paper, we are closing the gap by introducing an SDoEd ontology for creating a precise conceptualization of the interplay between life circumstances of students and their possible educational achievements. The ontology was developed utilizing suggestions from ChatGPT-3.5-010422 and validated using peer-reviewed research articles. The first version of developed ontology was evaluated by human experts in the field of education and validated using standard ontology evaluation software. This version of the SDoEd ontology contains 231 domain concepts, 10 object properties, and 24 data properties</description>

      <title>Large language models for automated scholarly paper review: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted human society, influencing various domains. Among them, academia is not simply a domain affected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs. In academic publications, this phenomenon is represented during the incorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts. We proposed the concept of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) in our previous paper. As the incorporation grows, it now enters the coexistence phase of ASPR and peer review, which is described in that paper. LLMs hold transformative potential for the full-scale implementation of ASPR, but they also pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey paper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin with a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review what ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the incorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods, new datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for ASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and investigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR. Lastly, we discuss the challenges associated with the development of LLMs for ASPR. We hope this survey can serve as an inspirational reference for the researchers and promote the progress of ASPR for its actual implementation.</description>

      <title>OmniThink: Expanding Knowledge Boundaries in Machine Writing through Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, utility, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, repetitive, and unoriginal outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they progressively deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles.</description>

      <title>VERITAS: Verifying the Performance of AI-native Transceiver Actions in Base-Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native receivers prove significant performance improvement in high noise regimes and can potentially reduce communication overhead compared to the traditional receiver. However, their performance highly depends on the representativeness of the training dataset. A major issue is the uncertainty of whether the training dataset covers all test environments and waveform configurations, and thus, whether the trained model is robust in practical deployment conditions. To this end, we propose a joint measurement-recovery framework for AI-native transceivers post deployment, called VERITAS, that continuously looks for distribution shifts in the received signals and triggers finite re-training spurts. VERITAS monitors the wireless channel using 5G pilots fed to an auxiliary neural network that detects out-of-distribution channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread. As soon as such a change is detected, a traditional (reference) receiver is activated, which runs for a period of time in parallel to the AI-native receiver. Finally, VERTIAS compares the bit probabilities of the AI-native and the reference receivers for the same received data inputs, and decides whether or not a retraining process needs to be initiated. Our evaluations reveal that VERITAS can detect changes in the channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread with 99%, 97%, and 69% accuracies, respectively, followed by timely initiation of retraining for 86%, 93.3%, and 94.8% of inputs in channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread test sets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the De-identification of Personally Identifiable Information in Educational Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as names, is a critical requirement in learning technologies to safeguard student and teacher privacy and maintain trust. Accurate PII detection is an essential step toward anonymizing sensitive information while preserving the utility of educational data. Motivated by recent advancements in artificial intelligence, our study investigates the GPT-4o-mini model as a cost-effective and efficient solution for PII detection tasks. We explore both prompting and fine-tuning approaches and compare GPT-4o-mini's performance against established frameworks, including Microsoft Presidio and Azure AI Language. Our evaluation on two public datasets, CRAPII and TSCC, demonstrates that the fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini model achieves superior performance, with a recall of 0.9589 on CRAPII. Additionally, fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini significantly improves precision scores (a threefold increase) while reducing computational costs to nearly one-tenth of those associated with Azure AI Language. Furthermore, our bias analysis reveals that the fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini model consistently delivers accurate results across diverse cultural backgrounds and genders. The generalizability analysis using the TSCC dataset further highlights its robustness, achieving a recall of 0.9895 with minimal additional training data from TSCC. These results emphasize the potential of fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini as an accurate and cost-effective tool for PII detection in educational data. It offers robust privacy protection while preserving the data's utility for research and pedagogical analysis. Our code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/AnonJD/PrivacyAI</description>

      <title>Boosting Tool Use of Large Language Models via Iterative Reinforced Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising approach to enhance their capabilities. Effectively leveraging this potential for complex tasks hinges crucially on improving their ability to use tools. Synthesizing tool use data by simulating the real world is an effective approach. Nevertheless, our investigation reveals that training gains significantly decay as the scale of these data increases. The primary factor is the model's poor performance (a.k.a deficiency) in complex scenarios, which hinders learning from data using SFT. Driven by this objective, we propose an iterative reinforced fine-tuning strategy to continually guide the model to alleviate it. Specifically, we first identify deficiency-related data based on feedback from the policy model, then perform a Monte Carlo Tree Search to collect fine-grained preference pairs to pinpoint deficiencies. Subsequently, we update the policy model using preference optimization to align with ground truth and misalign with deficiencies. This process can be iterated. Moreover, before the iteration, we propose an easy-to-hard warm-up SFT strategy to facilitate learning from challenging data. The experiments demonstrate our models go beyond the same parametric models, outperforming many larger open-source and closed-source models. Additionally, it has achieved notable training gains in complex tool use scenarios.</description>

      <title>LeMo: Enabling LEss Token Involvement for MOre Context Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating demand for long-context applications has intensified the necessity of extending the LLM context windows. Despite recent fine-tuning approaches successfully expanding context lengths, their high memory footprints, especially for activations, present a critical practical limitation. Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods prioritize reducing parameter update overhead over addressing activation memory constraints. Similarly, existing sparsity mechanisms improve computational efficiency but overlook activation memory optimization due to the phenomenon of Shadowy Activation.
  In this paper, we propose LeMo, the first LLM fine-tuning system that explores and exploits a new token-level sparsity mechanism inherent in long-context scenarios, termed Contextual Token Sparsity. LeMo minimizes redundant token involvement by assessing the informativeness of token embeddings while preserving model accuracy. Specifically, LeMo introduces three key techniques: (1) Token Elimination, dynamically identifying and excluding redundant tokens across varying inputs and layers. (2) Pattern Prediction, utilizing well-trained predictors to approximate token sparsity patterns with minimal overhead. (3) Kernel Optimization, employing permutation-free and segment-based strategies to boost system performance. We implement LeMo as an end-to-end fine-tuning system compatible with various LLM architectures and other optimization techniques. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that LeMo reduces memory consumption by up to 1.93x and achieves up to 1.36x speedups, outperforming state-of-the-art fine-tuning systems.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Predict the Outcome of Judicial Decisions?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP) across diverse domains. However, their application in specialized tasks such as Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) for low-resource languages like Arabic remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by developing an Arabic LJP dataset, collected and preprocessed from Saudi commercial court judgments. We benchmark state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, including LLaMA-3.2-3B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, under varying configurations such as zero-shot, one-shot, and fine-tuning using QLoRA. Additionally, we used a comprehensive evaluation framework combining quantitative metrics (BLEU and ROUGE) and qualitative assessments (Coherence, legal language, clarity). Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned smaller models achieve comparable performance to larger models in task-specific contexts while offering significant resource efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of prompt engineering and fine-tuning on model outputs, providing insights into performance variability and instruction sensitivity. By making the dataset, implementation code, and models publicly available, we establish a robust foundation for future research in Arabic legal NLP.</description>

      <title>EVAL: EigenVector-based Average-reward Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, two objective functions have been developed extensively in the literature: discounted and averaged rewards. The generalization to an entropy-regularized setting has led to improved robustness and exploration for both of these objectives. Recently, the entropy-regularized average-reward problem was addressed using tools from large deviation theory in the tabular setting. This method has the advantage of linearity, providing access to both the optimal policy and average reward-rate through properties of a single matrix. In this paper, we extend that framework to more general settings by developing approaches based on function approximation by neural networks. This formulation reveals new theoretical insights into the relationship between different objectives used in RL. Additionally, we combine our algorithm with a posterior policy iteration scheme, showing how our approach can also solve the average-reward RL problem without entropy-regularization. Using classic control benchmarks, we experimentally find that our method compares favorably with other algorithms in terms of stability and rate of convergence.</description>

      <title>Multiple Choice Questions: Reasoning Makes Large Language Models (LLMs) More Self-Confident Even When They Are Wrong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most widely used methods to evaluate LLMs are Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) tests. MCQ benchmarks enable the testing of LLM knowledge on almost any topic at scale as the results can be processed automatically. To help the LLM answer, a few examples called few shots can be included in the prompt. Moreover, the LLM can be asked to answer the question directly with the selected option or to first provide the reasoning and then the selected answer, which is known as chain of thought. In addition to checking whether the selected answer is correct, the evaluation can look at the LLM-estimated probability of its response as an indication of the confidence of the LLM in the response. In this paper, we study how the LLM confidence in its answer depends on whether the model has been asked to answer directly or to provide the reasoning before answering. The results of the evaluation of questions on a wide range of topics in seven different models show that LLMs are more confident in their answers when they provide reasoning before the answer. This occurs regardless of whether the selected answer is correct. Our hypothesis is that this behavior is due to the reasoning that modifies the probability of the selected answer, as the LLM predicts the answer based on the input question and the reasoning that supports the selection made. Therefore, LLM estimated probabilities seem to have intrinsic limitations that should be understood in order to use them in evaluation procedures. Interestingly, the same behavior has been observed in humans, for whom explaining an answer increases confidence in its correctness.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generalization in Chain of Thought Reasoning for Smaller Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in smaller language models is a challenging natural language process problem yet highly desirable in many real-life applications. Existing CoT knowledge distillation methods often suffer from overly conservative memorization in smaller LLMs, leading to low generalization confidence. As fully preserving the CoT ability of teacher model is impossible, we hypothesize that adversarial CoT fine-tuning is crucial for developing smaller LLM with robust CoT generalization. To this end, we propose \textit{PRompt-Assisted Domain-Adversarial fine-tuning} (PRADA), a principled fine-tuning framework that integrates diverse CoT domains. Specifically, PRADA pioneers two CoT improvements in smaller LLM: (1) Recovering the domain-invariant feature insight which typically lost during distillation with domain adversarial fine-tuning; (2) Enhancing the domain adaptability of CoT prompt engineering by employing domain-adversarial approaches. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and empirically show that it significantly outperforms the state of the arts in a wide range of tasks. Moreover, our empirical findings reveal that the smaller LLM, when leveraging PRADA, aligns closely with domain knowledge, thereby improving the explainability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Generalized Single-Image-Based Morphing Attack Detection Using Deep Representations from Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face morphing attacks have posed severe threats to Face Recognition Systems (FRS), which are operated in border control and passport issuance use cases. Correspondingly, morphing attack detection algorithms (MAD) are needed to defend against such attacks. MAD approaches must be robust enough to handle unknown attacks in an open-set scenario where attacks can originate from various morphing generation algorithms, post-processing and the diversity of printers/scanners. The problem of generalization is further pronounced when the detection has to be made on a single suspected image. In this paper, we propose a generalized single-image-based MAD (S-MAD) algorithm by learning the encoding from Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. Compared to CNN-based architectures, ViT model has the advantage on integrating local and global information and hence can be suitable to detect the morphing traces widely distributed among the face region. Extensive experiments are carried out on face morphing datasets generated using publicly available FRGC face datasets. Several state-of-the-art (SOTA) MAD algorithms, including representative ones that have been publicly evaluated, have been selected and benchmarked with our ViT-based approach. Obtained results demonstrate the improved detection performance of the proposed S-MAD method on inter-dataset testing (when different data is used for training and testing) and comparable performance on intra-dataset testing (when the same data is used for training and testing) experimental protocol.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the challenges of developing large language models (LLMs) proficient in both multilingual understanding and medical knowledge. We demonstrate that simply translating medical data does not guarantee strong performance on clinical tasks in the target language. Our experiments reveal that the optimal language mix in training data varies significantly across different medical tasks. We find that larger models with carefully calibrated language ratios achieve superior performance on native-language clinical tasks. Furthermore, our results suggest that relying solely on fine-tuning may not be the most effective approach for incorporating new language knowledge into LLMs. Instead, data and computationally intensive pretraining methods may still be necessary to achieve optimal performance in multilingual medical settings. These findings provide valuable guidance for building effective and inclusive medical AI systems for diverse linguistic communities.</description>

      <title>CrossModalityDiffusion: Multi-Modal Novel View Synthesis with Unified Intermediate Representation</title>

Abstract: Geospatial imaging leverages data from diverse sensing modalities-such as EO, SAR, and LiDAR, ranging from ground-level drones to satellite views. These heterogeneous inputs offer significant opportunities for scene understanding but present challenges in interpreting geometry accurately, particularly in the absence of precise ground truth data. To address this, we propose CrossModalityDiffusion, a modular framework designed to generate images across different modalities and viewpoints without prior knowledge of scene geometry. CrossModalityDiffusion employs modality-specific encoders that take multiple input images and produce geometry-aware feature volumes that encode scene structure relative to their input camera positions. The space where the feature volumes are placed acts as a common ground for unifying input modalities. These feature volumes are overlapped and rendered into feature images from novel perspectives using volumetric rendering techniques. The rendered feature images are used as conditioning inputs for a modality-specific diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of novel images for the desired output modality. In this paper, we show that jointly training different modules ensures consistent geometric understanding across all modalities within the framework. We validate CrossModalityDiffusion's capabilities on the synthetic ShapeNet cars dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating accurate and consistent novel views across multiple imaging modalities and perspectives.</description>

      <title>From Explainability to Interpretability: Interpretable Policies in Reinforcement Learning Via Model Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in complex domains, however, the inherent black box nature of deep neural network policies raises significant challenges in understanding and trusting the decision-making processes. While existing explainable RL methods provide local insights, they fail to deliver a global understanding of the model, particularly in high-stakes applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel model-agnostic approach that bridges the gap between explainability and interpretability by leveraging Shapley values to transform complex deep RL policies into transparent representations. The proposed approach offers two key contributions: a novel approach employing Shapley values to policy interpretation beyond local explanations and a general framework applicable to off-policy and on-policy algorithms. We evaluate our approach with three existing deep RL algorithms and validate its performance in two classic control environments. The results demonstrate that our approach not only preserves the original models' performance but also generates more stable interpretable policies.</description>

      <title>ASTRA: A Scene-aware TRAnsformer-based model for trajectory prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ASTRA (A} Scene-aware TRAnsformer-based model for trajectory prediction), a light-weight pedestrian trajectory forecasting model that integrates the scene context, spatial dynamics, social inter-agent interactions and temporal progressions for precise forecasting. We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).</description>

      <title>SLIM: Sim-to-Real Legged Instructive Manipulation via Long-Horizon Visuomotor Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a low-cost quadruped manipulation system that solves long-horizon real-world tasks, trained by reinforcement learning purely in simulation. The system comprises 1) a hierarchical design of a high-level policy for visual-mobile manipulation following instructions, and a low-level policy for quadruped movement and limb-control, 2) a progressive policy expansion approach for solving the long-horizon task together with a teacher-student framework for efficient high-level training of the high-level visuomotor policy, and 3) a suite of techniques for minimizing sim-to-real gaps.
  With budget-friendly but limited reliability and performance hardware, and just one wrist-mounted RGB camera, the entire system fully trained in simulation achieves high success rates for long horizon tasks involving search, move, grasp, and drop-into, with fluid sim-to-real transfer in a wide variety of indoor and outdoor scenes and lighting conditions.Extensive real-world evaluations show that on the long horizon mobile manipulation tasks, our system achieves good performance when transferred to real both in terms of task success rate and execution efficiency. Finally, we discuss the necessity of our sim-to-real techniques for legged mobile manipulation, and show their ablation performance.</description>

      <title>Study on a Fast Solver for Combined Field Integral Equations of 3D Conducting Bodies Based on Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a graph neural networks (GNNs)-based fast solver (GraphSolver) for solving combined field integral equations (CFIEs) of 3D conducting bodies. Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions are employed to discretely and accurately represent the geometry of 3D conducting bodies. A concise and informative graph representation is then constructed by treating each RWG function as a node in the graph, enabling the flow of current between nodes. With the transformed graphs, GraphSolver is developed to directly predict real and imaginary parts of the x, y and z components of the surface current densities at each node (RWG function). Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of GraphSolver in solving CFIEs for 3D conducting bodies with varying levels of geometric complexity, including basic 3D targets, missile-shaped targets, and airplane-shaped targets.</description>

      <title>IE-Bench: Advancing the Measurement of Text-Driven Image Editing for Human Perception Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven image editing have been significant, yet the task of accurately evaluating these edited images continues to pose a considerable challenge. Different from the assessment of text-driven image generation, text-driven image editing is characterized by simultaneously conditioning on both text and a source image. The edited images often retain an intrinsic connection to the original image, which dynamically change with the semantics of the text. However, previous methods tend to solely focus on text-image alignment or have not aligned with human perception. In this work, we introduce the Text-driven Image Editing Benchmark suite (IE-Bench) to enhance the assessment of text-driven edited images. IE-Bench includes a database contains diverse source images, various editing prompts and the corresponding results different editing methods, and total 3,010 Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided by 25 human subjects. Furthermore, we introduce IE-QA, a multi-modality source-aware quality assessment method for text-driven image editing. To the best of our knowledge, IE-Bench offers the first IQA dataset and model tailored for text-driven image editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate IE-QA's superior subjective-alignments on the text-driven image editing task compared with previous metrics. We will make all related data and code available to the public.</description>

      <title>Dialogue Benchmark Generation from Knowledge Graphs with Cost-Effective Retrieval-Augmented LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dialogue benchmarks are crucial in training and evaluating chatbots engaging in domain-specific conversations. Knowledge graphs (KGs) represent semantically rich and well-organized data spanning various domains, such as DBLP, DBpedia, and YAGO. Traditionally, dialogue benchmarks have been manually created from documents, neglecting the potential of KGs in automating this process. Some question-answering benchmarks are automatically generated using extensive preprocessing from KGs, but they do not support dialogue generation. This paper introduces Chatty-Gen, a novel multi-stage retrieval-augmented generation platform for automatically generating high-quality dialogue benchmarks tailored to a specific domain using a KG. Chatty-Gen decomposes the generation process into manageable stages and uses assertion rules for automatic validation between stages. Our approach enables control over intermediate results to prevent time-consuming restarts due to hallucinations. It also reduces reliance on costly and more powerful commercial LLMs. Chatty-Gen eliminates upfront processing of the entire KG using efficient query-based retrieval to find representative subgraphs based on the dialogue context. Our experiments with several real and large KGs demonstrate that Chatty-Gen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems and ensures consistent model and system performance across multiple LLMs of diverse capabilities, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Llama 3, and Mistral.</description>

      <title>Steering Large Language Models with Feature Guided Activation Additions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective and reliable control over large language model (LLM) behavior is a significant challenge. While activation steering methods, which add steering vectors to a model's hidden states, are a promising approach, existing techniques often lack precision and interpretability in how they influence model outputs. We introduce Feature Guided Activation Additions (FGAA), a novel activation steering method that leverages insights from Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and Sparse Autoencoder-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS). By operating in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) and employing optimization techniques to select desired SAE features, FGAA constructs precise steering vectors that provide better steering effects while maintaining coherence of steered model outputs. In this regard, evaluations on Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B models across various steering tasks demonstrate that FGAA outperforms existing steering methods of CAA, SAE decoder steering, and SAE-TS. Our results also highlight important trade-offs between steering scale and general model capabilities that are consistent across all tested steering methods.</description>

      <title>HEART: Achieving Timely Multi-Model Training for Vehicle-Edge-Cloud-Integrated Hierarchical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of AI-enabled Internet of Vehicles (IoV) calls for efficient machine learning (ML) solutions that can handle high vehicular mobility and decentralized data. This has motivated the emergence of Hierarchical Federated Learning over vehicle-edge-cloud architectures (VEC-HFL). Nevertheless, one aspect which is underexplored in the literature on VEC-HFL is that vehicles often need to execute multiple ML tasks simultaneously, where this multi-model training environment introduces crucial challenges. First, improper aggregation rules can lead to model obsolescence and prolonged training times. Second, vehicular mobility may result in inefficient data utilization by preventing the vehicles from returning their models to the network edge. Third, achieving a balanced resource allocation across diverse tasks becomes of paramount importance as it majorly affects the effectiveness of collaborative training. We take one of the first steps towards addressing these challenges via proposing a framework for multi-model training in dynamic VEC-HFL with the goal of minimizing global training latency while ensuring balanced training across various tasks-a problem that turns out to be NP-hard. To facilitate timely model training, we introduce a hybrid synchronous-asynchronous aggregation rule. Building on this, we present a novel method called Hybrid Evolutionary And gReedy allocaTion (HEART). The framework operates in two stages: first, it achieves balanced task scheduling through a hybrid heuristic approach that combines improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA); second, it employs a low-complexity greedy algorithm to determine the training priority of assigned tasks on vehicles. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HEART over existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm where clients collaboratively train a model while keeping their own data private. With an increasing scale of clients and models, FL encounters two key challenges, client drift due to a high degree of statistical/system heterogeneity, and lack of adaptivity. However, most existing FL research is based on unrealistic assumptions that virtually ignore system heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose Client-Centric Federated Adaptive Optimization, which is a class of novel federated adaptive optimization approaches. We enable several features in this framework such as arbitrary client participation, asynchronous server aggregation, and heterogeneous local computing, which are ubiquitous in real-world FL systems but are missed in most existing works. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis of our proposed framework for general nonconvex objectives, which is shown to converge with the best-known rate. Extensive experiments show that our approaches consistently outperform the baseline by a large margin across benchmarks.</description>

      <title>AI Explainability for Power Electronics: From a Lipschitz Continuity Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lifecycle management of power converters continues to thrive with emerging artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, yet AI mathematical explainability remains unexplored in power electronics (PE) community. The lack of theoretical rigor challenges adoption in mission-critical applications. Therefore, this letter proposes a generic framework to evaluate mathematical explainability, highlighting inference stability and training convergence from a Lipschitz continuity perspective. Inference stability governs consistent outputs under input perturbations, essential for robust real-time control and fault diagnosis. Training convergence guarantees stable learning dynamics, facilitating accurate modeling in PE contexts. Additionally, a Lipschitz-aware learning rate selection strategy is introduced to accelerate convergence while mitigating overshoots and oscillations. The feasibility of the proposed Lipschitz-oriented framework is demonstrated by validating the mathematical explainability of a state-of-the-art physics-in-architecture neural network, and substantiated through empirical case studies on dual-active-bridge converters. This letter serves as a clarion call for the PE community to embrace mathematical explainability, heralding a transformative era of trustworthy and explainable AI solutions that potentially redefine the future of power electronics.</description>

      <title>MultiPruner: Balanced Structure Removal in Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, state-of-the-art approaches for pruning large pre-trained models (LPMs) have demonstrated that the training-free removal of non-critical residual blocks in Transformers is viable for reducing model size, achieving results that outperform previous training-free pruning approaches. Motivated by these findings, we extend BlockPruner (Zhong et al., 2024) and propose MultiPruner, a pruning approach that surpasses recent training-free pruning methods by adopting a multidimensional, iterative, fine-grained pruning strategy. In MultiPruner, multidimensional pruning reinstates the structural balance in block-pruned models by sequentially compressing along three dimensions: i) residual blocks, ii) channels of multilayer perceptrons (MLP), and iii) attention heads. This solution enhances zero-shot accuracy on downstream tasks compared to other techniques while improving model compression ratios, producing compressed models with fewer computing and memory requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method across various large pre-trained models. The code and pruning configurations are available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/Hardware-Aware-Automated-Machine-Learning.</description>

      <title>AIRCHITECT v2: Learning the Hardware Accelerator Design Space through Unified Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design space exploration (DSE) plays a crucial role in enabling custom hardware architectures, particularly for emerging applications like AI, where optimized and specialized designs are essential. With the growing complexity of deep neural networks (DNNs) and the introduction of advanced foundational models (FMs), the design space for DNN accelerators is expanding at an exponential rate. Additionally, this space is highly non-uniform and non-convex, making it increasingly difficult to navigate and optimize. Traditional DSE techniques rely on search-based methods, which involve iterative sampling of the design space to find the optimal solution. However, this process is both time-consuming and often fails to converge to the global optima for such design spaces. Recently, AIrchitect v1, the first attempt to address the limitations of search-based techniques, transformed DSE into a constant-time classification problem using recommendation networks. In this work, we propose AIrchitect v2, a more accurate and generalizable learning-based DSE technique applicable to large-scale design spaces that overcomes the shortcomings of earlier approaches. Specifically, we devise an encoder-decoder transformer model that (a) encodes the complex design space into a uniform intermediate representation using contrastive learning and (b) leverages a novel unified representation blending the advantages of classification and regression to effectively explore the large DSE space without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results evaluated on 10^5 real DNN workloads demonstrate that, on average, AIrchitect v2 outperforms existing techniques by 15% in identifying optimal design points. Furthermore, to demonstrate the generalizability of our method, we evaluate performance on unseen model workloads (LLMs) and attain a 1.7x improvement in inference latency on the identified hardware architecture.</description>

However, the decision logic of these frameworks is often not transparent, making it difficult for stakeholders to understand, interpret or explain their behavior. This limitation hinders trust in machine learning systems and causes a general reluctance towards their adoption in practical applications, particularly in mission-critical domains like healthcare and autonomous driving. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques facilitate the explainability or interpretability of machine learning models, enabling users to discern the basis of the decision and possibly avert undesirable behavior. This comprehensive survey details the advancements of explainable AI methods, from inherently interpretable models to modern approaches for achieving interpretability of various black box models, including large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we review explainable AI techniques that leverage LLM and vision-language model (VLM) frameworks to automate or improve the explainability of other machine learning models. The use of LLM and VLM as interpretability methods particularly enables high-level, semantically meaningful explanations of model decisions and behavior. Throughout the paper, we highlight the scientific principles, strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art methods and outline different areas of improvement. Where appropriate, we also present qualitative and quantitative comparison results of various methods to show how they compare. Finally, we discuss the key challenges of XAI and directions for future research.</description>

Abstract: Composing music for video is essential yet challenging, leading to a growing interest in automating music generation for video applications. Existing approaches often struggle to achieve robust music-video correspondence and generative diversity, primarily due to inadequate feature alignment methods and insufficient datasets. In this study, we present General Video-to-Music Generation model (GVMGen), designed for generating high-related music to the video input. Our model employs hierarchical attentions to extract and align video features with music in both spatial and temporal dimensions, ensuring the preservation of pertinent features while minimizing redundancy. Remarkably, our method is versatile, capable of generating multi-style music from different video inputs, even in zero-shot scenarios. We also propose an evaluation model along with two novel objective metrics for assessing video-music alignment. Additionally, we have compiled a large-scale dataset comprising diverse types of video-music pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that GVMGen surpasses previous models in terms of music-video correspondence, generative diversity, and application universality.</description>

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is a common cerebrovascular disease that is usually asymptomatic but may cause severe subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) if ruptured. Although clinical practice is usually based on individual factors and morphological features of the aneurysm, its pathophysiology and hemodynamic mechanisms remain controversial. To address the limitations of current research, this study constructed a comprehensive hemodynamic dataset of intracranial aneurysms. The dataset is based on 466 real aneurysm models, and 10,000 synthetic models were generated by resection and deformation operations, including 466 aneurysm-free models and 9,534 deformed aneurysm models. The dataset also provides medical image-like segmentation mask files to support insightful analysis. In addition, the dataset contains hemodynamic data measured at eight steady-state flow rates (0.001 to 0.004 kg/s), including critical parameters such as flow velocity, pressure, and wall shear stress, providing a valuable resource for investigating aneurysm pathogenesis and clinical prediction. This dataset will help advance the understanding of the pathologic features and hemodynamic mechanisms of intracranial aneurysms and support in-depth research in related fields.

      <description>arXiv:2501.09982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video generation models have made impressive progress, but they still struggle with generating videos with complex features. This limitation often arises from the inability of the text encoder to produce accurate embeddings, which hinders the video generation model. In this work, we propose a novel approach to overcome this challenge by selecting the optimal text embedding through interpolation in the embedding space. We demonstrate that this method enables the video generation model to produce the desired videos. Additionally, we introduce a simple algorithm using perpendicular foot embeddings and cosine similarity to identify the optimal interpolation embedding. Our findings highlight the importance of accurate text embeddings and offer a pathway for improving text-to-video generation performance.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Attention Networks for Enhanced Segmentation and Depth Estimation of Subsurface Defects in Pulse Thermography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-driven pulse thermography (PT) has become a crucial tool in non-destructive testing (NDT), enabling automatic detection of hidden anomalies in various industrial components. Current state-of-the-art techniques feed segmentation and depth estimation networks compressed PT sequences using either Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Thermographic Signal Reconstruction (TSR). However, treating these two modalities independently constrains the performance of PT inspection models as these representations possess complementary semantic features. To address this limitation, this work proposes PT-Fusion, a multi-modal attention-based fusion network that fuses both PCA and TSR modalities for defect segmentation and depth estimation of subsurface defects in PT setups. PT-Fusion introduces novel feature fusion modules, Encoder Attention Fusion Gate (EAFG) and Attention Enhanced Decoding Block (AEDB), to fuse PCA and TSR features for enhanced segmentation and depth estimation of subsurface defects. In addition, a novel data augmentation technique is proposed based on random data sampling from thermographic sequences to alleviate the scarcity of PT datasets. The proposed method is benchmarked against state-of-the-art PT inspection models, including U-Net, attention U-Net, and 3D-CNN on the Universit\'e Laval IRT-PVC dataset. The results demonstrate that PT-Fusion outperforms the aforementioned models in defect segmentation and depth estimation accuracies with a margin of 10%.</description>

      <title>Attention-guided Self-reflection for Zero-shot Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucination has emerged as a significant barrier to the effective application of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Guided SElf-Reflection (AGSER) approach for zero-shot hallucination detection in LLMs. The AGSER method utilizes attention contributions to categorize the input query into attentive and non-attentive queries. Each query is then processed separately through the LLMs, allowing us to compute consistency scores between the generated responses and the original answer. The difference between the two consistency scores serves as a hallucination estimator. In addition to its efficacy in detecting hallucinations, AGSER notably reduces computational complexity, requiring only three passes through the LLM and utilizing two sets of tokens. We have conducted extensive experiments with four widely-used LLMs across three different hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot hallucination detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by dementia and impairment in neurological function. The study primarily focuses on the individuals above age 40, affecting their memory, behavior, and cognitive processes of the brain. Alzheimer's disease requires diagnosis by a detailed assessment of MRI scans and neuropsychological tests of the patients. This project compares existing deep learning models in the pursuit of enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of AD diagnosis, specifically focusing on the Convolutional Neural Network, Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network, and the U-net model with the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies brain MRI dataset. Besides, to ensure robustness and reliability in the model evaluations, we address the challenge of imbalance in data. We then perform rigorous evaluation to determine strengths and weaknesses for each model by considering sensitivity, specificity, and computational efficiency. This comparative analysis would shed light on the future role of AI in revolutionizing AD diagnostics but also paved ways for future innovation in medical imaging and the management of neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Spatiotemporal Augmentation for Improving Dynamic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic graph augmentation is used to improve the performance of dynamic GNNs. Most methods assume temporal locality, meaning that recent edges are more influential than earlier edges. However, for temporal changes in edges caused by random noise, overemphasizing recent edges while neglecting earlier ones may lead to the model capturing noise. To address this issue, we propose STAA (SpatioTemporal Activity-Aware Random Walk Diffusion). STAA identifies nodes likely to have noisy edges in spatiotemporal dimensions. Spatially, it analyzes critical topological positions through graph wavelet coefficients. Temporally, it analyzes edge evolution through graph wavelet coefficient change rates. Then, random walks are used to reduce the weights of noisy edges, deriving a diffusion matrix containing spatiotemporal information as an augmented adjacency matrix for dynamic GNN learning. Experiments on multiple datasets show that STAA outperforms other dynamic graph augmentation methods in node classification and link prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations on Object Attributes using Multiview Images and Negative Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current popular Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are suffering from Hallucinations on Object Attributes (HoOA), leading to incorrect determination of fine-grained attributes in the input images. Leveraging significant advancements in 3D generation from a single image, this paper proposes a novel method to mitigate HoOA in LVLMs. This method utilizes multiview images sampled from generated 3D representations as visual prompts for LVLMs, thereby providing more visual information from other viewpoints. Furthermore, we observe the input order of multiple multiview images significantly affects the performance of LVLMs. Consequently, we have devised Multiview Image Augmented VLM (MIAVLM), incorporating a Multiview Attributes Perceiver (MAP) submodule capable of simultaneously eliminating the influence of input image order and aligning visual information from multiview images with Large Language Models (LLMs). Besides, we designed and employed negative instructions to mitigate LVLMs' bias towards ``Yes" responses. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Automatic Speech Recognition for Sanskrit with Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sanskrit, one of humanity's most ancient languages, has a vast collection of books and manuscripts on diverse topics that have been accumulated over millennia. However, its digital content (audio and text), which is vital for the training of AI systems, is profoundly limited. Furthermore, its intricate linguistics make it hard to develop robust NLP tools for wider accessibility. Given these constraints, we have developed an automatic speech recognition model for Sanskrit by employing transfer learning mechanism on OpenAI's Whisper model. After carefully optimising the hyper-parameters, we obtained promising results with our transfer-learned model achieving a word error rate of 15.42% on Vaksancayah dataset. An online demo of our model is made available for the use of public and to evaluate its performance firsthand thereby paving the way for improved accessibility and technological support for Sanskrit learning in the modern era.</description>

      <title>Virtual Nodes Improve Long-term Traffic Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective traffic prediction is a cornerstone of intelligent transportation systems, enabling precise forecasts of traffic flow, speed, and congestion. While traditional spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in short-term traffic forecasting, their performance in long-term predictions remains limited. This challenge arises from over-squashing problem, where bottlenecks and limited receptive fields restrict information flow and hinder the modeling of global dependencies. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel framework that incorporates virtual nodes, which are additional nodes added to the graph and connected to existing nodes, in order to aggregate information across the entire graph within a single GNN layer. Our proposed model incorporates virtual nodes by constructing a semi-adaptive adjacency matrix. This matrix integrates distance-based and adaptive adjacency matrices, allowing the model to leverage geographical information while also learning task-specific features from data. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of virtual nodes significantly enhances long-term prediction accuracy while also improving layer-wise sensitivity to mitigate the over-squashing problem. Virtual nodes also offer enhanced explainability by focusing on key intersections and high-traffic areas, as shown by the visualization of their adjacency matrix weights on road network heat maps. Our advanced approach enhances the understanding and management of urban traffic systems, making it particularly well-suited for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Large Language Models through Partially Linear Feed-Forward Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but face deployment challenges due to their massive parameter counts. While existing compression techniques like pruning can reduce model size, it leads to significant accuracy degradation under high compression ratios. We present a novel perspective inspired by constant folding in compiler optimization. Our approach enables parameter reduction by treating activation functions in LLMs as linear functions.
  However, recent LLMs use complex non-linear activations like GELU that prevent direct application of this technique. We propose TARDIS, which enables optimization of LLMs with non-linear activations by partially approximating them with linear functions in frequently occurring input ranges. For outlier inputs, TARDIS employs an online predictor to dynamically fall back to original computations.
  Our experiments demonstrate that TARDIS achieves 80% parameter reduction in feed-forward networks, while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art pruning methods Wanda and RIA with up to 65% higher accuracy. In practical deployments for a 7B model, TARDIS achieves 1.6x end-to-end inference speedup when integrated with the vLLM serving system, and 1.4x speedup with the widely adopted HuggingFace implementation, while incurring only a 10.9% accuracy trade-off.</description>

      <title>SpatialCoT: Advancing Spatial Reasoning through Coordinate Alignment and Chain-of-Thought for Embodied Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning is an essential problem in embodied AI research. Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Change Captioning in Remote Sensing: SECOND-CC Dataset and MModalCC Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning (RSICC) aims to describe changes between bitemporal images in natural language. Existing methods often fail under challenges like illumination differences, viewpoint changes, blur effects, leading to inaccuracies, especially in no-change regions. Moreover, the images acquired at different spatial resolutions and have registration errors tend to affect the captions. To address these issues, we introduce SECOND-CC, a novel RSICC dataset featuring high-resolution RGB image pairs, semantic segmentation maps, and diverse real-world scenarios. SECOND-CC which contains 6,041 pairs of bitemporal RS images and 30,205 sentences describing the differences between images. Additionally, we propose MModalCC, a multimodal framework that integrates semantic and visual data using advanced attention mechanisms, including Cross-Modal Cross Attention (CMCA) and Multimodal Gated Cross Attention (MGCA). Detailed ablation studies and attention visualizations further demonstrate its effectiveness and ability to address RSICC challenges. Comprehensive experiments show that MModalCC outperforms state-of-the-art RSICC methods, including RSICCformer, Chg2Cap, and PSNet with +4.6% improvement on BLEU4 score and +9.6% improvement on CIDEr score.

      <title>How Do Programming Students Use Generative AI?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programming students have a widespread access to powerful Generative AI tools like ChatGPT. While this can help understand the learning material and assist with exercises, educators are voicing more and more concerns about an over-reliance on generated outputs and lack of critical thinking skills. It is thus important to understand how students actually use generative AI and what impact this could have on their learning behavior. To this end, we conducted a study including an exploratory experiment with 37 programming students, giving them monitored access to ChatGPT while solving a code understanding and improving exercise. While only 23 of the students actually opted to use the chatbot, the majority of those eventually prompted it to simply generate a full solution. We observed two prevalent usage strategies: to seek knowledge about general concepts and to directly generate solutions. Instead of using the bot to comprehend the code and their own mistakes, students often got trapped in a vicious cycle of submitting wrong generated code and then asking the bot for a fix. Those who self-reported using generative AI regularly were more likely to prompt the bot to generate a solution. Our findings indicate that concerns about potential decrease in programmers' agency and productivity with Generative AI are justified. We discuss how researchers and educators can respond to the potential risk of students uncritically over-relying on generative AI. We also discuss potential modifications to our study design for large-scale replications.</description>

      <title>landmarker: a Toolkit for Anatomical Landmark Localization in 2D/3D Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anatomical landmark localization in 2D/3D images is a critical task in medical imaging. Although many general-purpose tools exist for landmark localization in classical computer vision tasks, such as pose estimation, they lack the specialized features and modularity necessary for anatomical landmark localization applications in the medical domain. Therefore, we introduce landmarker, a Python package built on PyTorch. The package provides a comprehensive, flexible toolkit for developing and evaluating landmark localization algorithms, supporting a range of methodologies, including static and adaptive heatmap regression. landmarker enhances the accuracy of landmark identification, streamlines research and development processes, and supports various image formats and preprocessing pipelines. Its modular design allows users to customize and extend the toolkit for specific datasets and applications, accelerating innovation in medical imaging. landmarker addresses a critical need for precision and customization in landmark localization tasks not adequately met by existing general-purpose pose estimation tools.</description>

      <title>Robotic World Model: A Neural Network Simulator for Robust Policy Optimization in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning robust and generalizable world models is crucial for enabling efficient and scalable robotic control in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for learning world models that accurately capture complex, partially observable, and stochastic dynamics. The proposed method employs a dual-autoregressive mechanism and self-supervised training to achieve reliable long-horizon predictions without relying on domain-specific inductive biases, ensuring adaptability across diverse robotic tasks. We further propose a policy optimization framework that leverages world models for efficient training in imagined environments and seamless deployment in real-world systems. Through extensive experiments, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior autoregressive prediction accuracy, robustness to noise, and generalization across manipulation and locomotion tasks. Notably, policies trained with our method are successfully deployed on ANYmal D hardware in a zero-shot transfer, achieving robust performance with minimal sim-to-real performance loss. This work advances model-based reinforcement learning by addressing the challenges of long-horizon prediction, error accumulation, and sim-to-real transfer. By providing a scalable and robust framework, the introduced methods pave the way for adaptive and efficient robotic systems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Universal Actions for Enhanced Embodied Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training on diverse, internet-scale data is a key factor in the success of recent large foundation models. Yet, using the same recipe for building embodied agents has faced noticeable difficulties. Despite the availability of many crowd-sourced embodied datasets, their action spaces often exhibit significant heterogeneity due to distinct physical embodiment and control interfaces for different robots, causing substantial challenges in developing embodied foundation models using cross-domain data. In this paper, we introduce UniAct, a new embodied foundation modeling framework operating in a tokenized Universal Action Space. Our learned universal actions capture the generic atomic behaviors across diverse robots by exploiting their shared structural features, and enable enhanced cross-domain data utilization and cross-embodiment generalizations by eliminating the notorious heterogeneity. The universal actions can be efficiently translated back to heterogeneous actionable commands by simply adding embodiment-specific details, from which fast adaptation to new robots becomes simple and straightforward. Our 0.5B instantiation of UniAct outperforms 14X larger SOTA embodied foundation models in extensive evaluations on various real-world and simulation robots, showcasing exceptional cross-embodiment control and adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of adopting universal actions.

Abstract: This paper advances NLP research for the low-resource Uzbek language by evaluating two previously untested monolingual Uzbek BERT models on the part-of-speech (POS) tagging task and introducing the first publicly available UPOS-tagged benchmark dataset for Uzbek. Our fine-tuned models achieve 91% average accuracy, outperforming the baseline multi-lingual BERT as well as the rule-based tagger. Notably, these models capture intermediate POS changes through affixes and demonstrate context sensitivity, unlike existing rule-based taggers.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Graph Learning on Adaptive Mined Key Frames for High-performance Multi-Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of multi-object tracking, the challenge of accurately capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between objects in video sequences remains a significant hurdle. This is further complicated by frequent occurrences of mutual occlusions among objects, which can lead to tracking errors and reduced performance in existing methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel adaptive key frame mining strategy that addresses the limitations of current tracking approaches. Specifically, we introduce a Key Frame Extraction (KFE) module that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively segment videos, thereby guiding the tracker to exploit the intrinsic logic of the video content. This approach allows us to capture structured spatial relationships between different objects as well as the temporal relationships of objects across frames. To tackle the issue of object occlusions, we have developed an Intra-Frame Feature Fusion (IFF) module. Unlike traditional graph-based methods that primarily focus on inter-frame feature fusion, our IFF module uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to facilitate information exchange between the target and surrounding objects within a frame. This innovation significantly enhances target distinguishability and mitigates tracking loss and appearance similarity due to occlusions. By combining the strengths of both long and short trajectories and considering the spatial relationships between objects, our proposed tracker achieves impressive results on the MOT17 dataset, i.e., 68.6 HOTA, 81.0 IDF1, 66.6 AssA, and 893 IDS, proving its effectiveness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction Sets with Improved Conditional Coverage using Trust Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard conformal prediction offers a marginal guarantee on coverage, but for prediction sets to be truly useful, they should ideally ensure coverage conditional on each test point. Unfortunately, it is impossible to achieve exact, distribution-free conditional coverage in finite samples. In this work, we propose an alternative conformal prediction algorithm that targets coverage where it matters most--in instances where a classifier is overconfident in its incorrect predictions. We start by dissecting miscoverage events in marginally-valid conformal prediction, and show that miscoverage rates vary based on the classifier's confidence and its deviation from the Bayes optimal classifier. Motivated by this insight, we develop a variant of conformal prediction that targets coverage conditional on a reduced set of two variables: the classifier's confidence in a prediction and a nonparametric trust score that measures its deviation from the Bayes classifier. Empirical evaluation on multiple image datasets shows that our method generally improves conditional coverage properties compared to standard conformal prediction, including class-conditional coverage, coverage over arbitrary subgroups, and coverage over demographic groups.</description>

      <title>Enhancing UAV Path Planning Efficiency Through Accelerated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly essential in various fields such as surveillance, reconnaissance, and telecommunications. This study aims to develop a learning algorithm for the path planning of UAV wireless communication relays, which can reduce storage requirements and accelerate Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) convergence. Assuming the system possesses terrain maps of the area and can estimate user locations using localization algorithms or direct GPS reporting, it can input these parameters into the learning algorithms to achieve optimized path planning performance. However, higher resolution terrain maps are necessary to extract topological information such as terrain height, object distances, and signal blockages. This requirement increases memory and storage demands on UAVs while also lengthening convergence times in DRL algorithms. Similarly, defining the telecommunication coverage map in UAV wireless communication relays using these terrain maps and user position estimations demands higher memory and storage utilization for the learning path planning algorithms. Our approach reduces path planning training time by applying a dimensionality reduction technique based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), sample combination, Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), and the combination of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss calculations in the coverage map estimates, thereby enhancing a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. The proposed solution reduces the convergence episodes needed for basic training by approximately four times compared to the traditional TD3.</description>

      <title>Dual Debiasing: Remove Stereotypes and Keep Factual Gender for Fair Language Modeling and Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitigation of biases, such as language models' reliance on gender stereotypes, is a crucial endeavor required for the creation of reliable and useful language technology. The crucial aspect of debiasing is to ensure that the models preserve their versatile capabilities, including their ability to solve language tasks and equitably represent various genders. To address this issue, we introduce a streamlined Dual Dabiasing Algorithm through Model Adaptation (2DAMA). Novel Dual Debiasing enables robust reduction of stereotypical bias while preserving desired factual gender information encoded by language models. We show that 2DAMA effectively reduces gender bias in English and is one of the first approaches facilitating the mitigation of stereotypical tendencies in translation. The proposed method's key advantage is the preservation of factual gender cues, which are useful in a wide range of natural language processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Region-wise stacking ensembles for estimating brain-age using MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive modeling using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is a prominent approach to study brain-aging. Machine learning algorithms and feature extraction methods have been employed to improve predictions and explore healthy and accelerated aging e.g. neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The high-dimensional MRI data pose challenges to building generalizable and interpretable models as well as for data privacy. Common practices are resampling or averaging voxels within predefined parcels, which reduces anatomical specificity and biological interpretability as voxels within a region may differently relate to aging. Effectively, naive fusion by averaging can result in information loss and reduced accuracy. We present a conceptually novel two-level stacking ensemble (SE) approach. The first level comprises regional models for predicting individuals' age based on voxel-wise information, fused by a second-level model yielding final predictions. Eight data fusion scenarios were explored using as input Gray matter volume (GMV) estimates from four datasets covering the adult lifespan. Performance, measured using mean absolute error (MAE), R2, correlation and prediction bias, showed that SE outperformed the region-wise averages. The best performance was obtained when first-level regional predictions were obtained as out-of-sample predictions on the application site with second-level models trained on independent and site-specific data (MAE=4.75 vs baseline regional mean GMV MAE=5.68). Performance improved as more datasets were used for training. First-level predictions showed improved and more robust aging signal providing new biological insights and enhanced data privacy. Overall, the SE improves accuracy compared to the baseline while preserving or enhancing data privacy.</description>

      <title>A Simple but Effective Closed-form Solution for Extreme Multi-label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme multi-label learning (XML) is a task of assigning multiple labels from an extremely large set of labels to each data instance. Many current high-performance XML models are composed of a lot of hyperparameters, which complicates the tuning process. Additionally, the models themselves are adapted specifically to XML, which complicates their reimplementation. To remedy this problem, we propose a simple method based on ridge regression for XML. The proposed method not only has a closed-form solution but also is composed of a single hyperparameter. Since there are no precedents on applying ridge regression to XML, this paper verified the performance of the method by using various XML benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we enhanced the prediction of low-frequency labels in XML, which hold informative content. This prediction is essential yet challenging because of the limited amount of data. Here, we employed a simple frequency-based weighting. This approach greatly simplifies the process compared with existing techniques. Experimental results revealed that it can achieve levels of performance comparable to, or even exceeding, those of models with numerous hyperparameters. Additionally, we found that the frequency-based weighting significantly improved the predictive performance for low-frequency labels, while requiring almost no changes in implementation. The source code for the proposed method is available on github at https://github.com/cars1015/XML-ridge.</description>

      <title>Good things come in small packages: Should we adopt Lite-GPUs in AI infrastructure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To match the blooming demand of generative AI workloads, GPU designers have so far been trying to pack more and more compute and memory into single complex and expensive packages. However, there is growing uncertainty about the scalability of individual GPUs and thus AI clusters, as state-of-the-art GPUs are already displaying packaging, yield, and cooling limitations. We propose to rethink the design and scaling of AI clusters through efficiently-connected large clusters of Lite-GPUs, GPUs with single, small dies and a fraction of the capabilities of larger GPUs. We think recent advances in co-packaged optics can be key in overcoming the communication challenges of distributing AI workloads onto more Lite-GPUs. In this paper, we present the key benefits of Lite-GPUs on manufacturing cost, blast radius, yield, and power efficiency; and discuss systems opportunities and challenges around resource, workload, memory, and network management.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic predictive modeling using electronic health record (EHR) data has gained significant attention in recent years. The reliability and trustworthiness of such models depend heavily on the quality of the underlying data, which is largely determined by the stages preceding the model development: data extraction from EHR systems and data preparation. We list over forty challenges encountered during these stages and provide actionable recommendations for addressing them. These challenges are organized into four categories: cohort definition, outcome definition, feature engineering, and data cleaning. This list is designed to serve as a practical guide for data extraction engineers and researchers, supporting better practices and improving the quality and real-world applicability of dynamic prediction models in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Random-Key Algorithms for Optimizing Integrated Operating Room Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient surgery room scheduling is essential for hospital efficiency, patient satisfaction, and resource utilization. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a novel concept of Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), rigorously tested on literature and new, real-world inspired instances. Our combinatorial optimization problem incorporates multi-room scheduling, equipment scheduling, and complex availability constraints for rooms, patients, and surgeons, facilitating rescheduling and enhancing operational flexibility. The RKO approach represents solutions as points in a continuous space, which are then mapped in the problem solution space via a deterministic function known as a decoder. The core idea is to operate metaheuristics and heuristics in the random-key space, unaware of the original solution space. We design the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with $Q$-Learning, Simulated Annealing, and Iterated Local Search for use within an RKO framework, employing a single decoder function. The proposed metaheuristics are complemented by lower-bound formulations, providing optimal gaps for evaluating the effectiveness of the heuristic results. Our results demonstrate significant lower and upper bounds improvements for the literature instances, notably proving one optimal result. Furthermore, the best-proposed metaheuristic efficiently generates schedules for the newly introduced instances, even in highly constrained scenarios. This research offers valuable insights and practical solutions for improving surgery scheduling processes, offering tangible benefits to hospitals by optimising resource allocation, reducing patient wait times, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Rhythm and Voice Conversion of Dysarthric to Healthy Speech for ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are well known to perform poorly on dysarthric speech. Previous works have addressed this by speaking rate modification to reduce the mismatch with typical speech. Unfortunately, these approaches rely on transcribed speech data to estimate speaking rates and phoneme durations, which might not be available for unseen speakers. Therefore, we combine unsupervised rhythm and voice conversion methods based on self-supervised speech representations to map dysarthric to typical speech. We evaluate the outputs with a large ASR model pre-trained on healthy speech without further fine-tuning and find that the proposed rhythm conversion especially improves performance for speakers of the Torgo corpus with more severe cases of dysarthria.

      <title>SEANN: A Domain-Informed Neural Network for Epidemiological Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In epidemiology, traditional statistical methods such as logistic regression, linear regression, and other parametric models are commonly employed to investigate associations between predictors and health outcomes. However, non-parametric machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), coupled with explainable AI (XAI) tools, offer new opportunities for this task. Despite their potential, these methods face challenges due to the limited availability of high-quality, high-quantity data in this field. To address these challenges, we introduce SEANN, a novel approach for informed DNNs that leverages a prevalent form of domain-specific knowledge: Pooled Effect Sizes (PES). PESs are commonly found in published Meta-Analysis studies, in different forms, and represent a quantitative form of a scientific consensus. By direct integration within the learning procedure using a custom loss, we experimentally demonstrate significant improvements in the generalizability of predictive performances and the scientific plausibility of extracted relationships compared to a domain-knowledge agnostic neural network in a scarce and noisy data setting.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Autoregressive Transformers: Combining Byte-~and Word-Level Processing for Robust, Adaptable Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing, breaking text into units that computational models can process. While learned subword tokenizers have become the de-facto standard, they present challenges such as large vocabularies, limited adaptability to new domains or languages, and sensitivity to spelling errors and variations. To overcome these limitations, we investigate a hierarchical architecture for autoregressive language modelling that combines character-level and word-level processing. It employs a lightweight character-level encoder to convert character sequences into word embeddings, which are then processed by a word-level backbone model and decoded back into characters via a compact character-level decoder. This method retains the sequence compression benefits of word-level tokenization without relying on a rigid, predefined vocabulary. We demonstrate, at scales up to 7 billion parameters, that hierarchical transformers match the downstream task performance of subword-tokenizer-based models while exhibiting significantly greater robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, during continued pretraining on an out-of-domain language, our model trains almost twice as fast, achieves superior performance on the target language, and retains more of its previously learned knowledge. Hierarchical transformers pave the way for NLP systems that are more robust, flexible, and generalizable across languages and domains.</description>

      <title>Agent4Edu: Generating Learner Response Data by Generative Agents for Intelligent Education Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized learning represents a promising educational strategy within intelligent educational systems, aiming to enhance learners' practice efficiency. However, the discrepancy between offline metrics and online performance significantly impedes their progress. To address this challenge, we introduce Agent4Edu, a novel personalized learning simulator leveraging recent advancements in human intelligence through large language models (LLMs). Agent4Edu features LLM-powered generative agents equipped with learner profile, memory, and action modules tailored to personalized learning algorithms. The learner profiles are initialized using real-world response data, capturing practice styles and cognitive factors. Inspired by human psychology theory, the memory module records practice facts and high-level summaries, integrating reflection mechanisms. The action module supports various behaviors, including exercise understanding, analysis, and response generation. Each agent can interact with personalized learning algorithms, such as computerized adaptive testing, enabling a multifaceted evaluation and enhancement of customized services. Through a comprehensive assessment, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of Agent4Edu, emphasizing the consistency and discrepancies in responses between agents and human learners. The code, data, and appendix are publicly available at https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/Agent4Edu.</description>

      <title>A Generic Model for Swarm Intelligence and Its Validations</title>

Abstract: The modeling of emergent swarm intelligence constitutes a major challenge and it has been tackled in a number of different ways. However, existing approaches fail to capture the nature of swarm intelligence and they are either too abstract for practical application or not generic enough to describe the various types of emergence phenomena. In this paper, a contradiction-centric model for swarm intelligence is proposed, in which individu-als determine their behaviors based on their internal contradictions whilst they associate and interact to update their contradictions. The model hypothesizes that 1) the emergence of swarm intelligence is rooted in the de-velopment of individuals' internal contradictions and the interactions taking place between individuals and the environment, and 2) swarm intelligence is essentially a combinative reflection of the configurations of individuals' internal contradictions and the distributions of these contradictions across individuals. The model is formally described and five swarm intelligence systems are studied to illustrate its broad applicability. The studies confirm the generic character of the model and its effectiveness for describing the emergence of various kinds of swarm intelligence; and they also demonstrate that the model is straightforward to apply, without the need for complicated computations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Iterative Enhancement for Improving Learnersourced Multiple-Choice Question Explanations with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10444v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit superior capabilities in processing and understanding language, yet their applications in educational contexts remain underexplored. Learnersourcing enhances learning by engaging students in creating their own educational content. When learnersourcing multiple-choice questions, creating explanations for the solution of a question is a crucial step; it helps other students understand the solution and promotes a deeper understanding of related concepts. However, it is often difficult for students to craft effective solution explanations, due to limited subject understanding. To help scaffold the task of automated explanation generation, we present and evaluate a framework called "ILearner-LLM", that iteratively enhances the generated explanations for the given questions with large language models. Comprising an explanation generation model and an explanation evaluation model, the framework generates high-quality student-aligned explanations by iteratively feeding the quality rating score from the evaluation model back into the instruction prompt of the explanation generation model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ILearner-LLM on LLaMA2-13B and GPT-4 to generate higher quality explanations that are closer to those written by students on five PeerWise datasets. Our findings represent a promising path to enrich the learnersourcing experience for students and to enhance the capabilities of large language models for educational applications.</description>

Abstract: The Animal-AI Environment is a unique game-based research platform designed to facilitate collaboration between the artificial intelligence and comparative cognition research communities. In this paper, we present the latest version of the Animal-AI Environment, outlining several major features that make the game more engaging for humans and more complex for AI systems. These features include interactive buttons, reward dispensers, and player notifications, as well as an overhaul of the environment's graphics and processing for significant improvements in agent training time and quality of the human player experience. We provide detailed guidance on how to build computational and behavioural experiments with the Animal-AI Environment. We present results from a series of agents, including the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning agent Dreamer-v3, on newly designed tests and the Animal-AI Testbed of 900 tasks inspired by research in the field of comparative cognition. The Animal-AI Environment offers a new approach for modelling cognition in humans and non-human animals, and for building biologically inspired artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Agent Hospital: A Simulacrum of Hospital with Evolvable Medical Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a new wave of technological revolution in medical artificial intelligence (AI). While LLMs are designed to understand and generate text like a human, autonomous agents that utilize LLMs as their "brain" have exhibited capabilities beyond text processing such as planning, reflection, and using tools by enabling their "bodies" to interact with the environment. We introduce a simulacrum of hospital called Agent Hospital that simulates the entire process of treating illness, in which all patients, nurses, and doctors are LLM-powered autonomous agents. Within the simulacrum, doctor agents are able to evolve by treating a large number of patient agents without the need to label training data manually. After treating tens of thousands of patient agents in the simulacrum (human doctors may take several years in the real world), the evolved doctor agents outperform state-of-the-art medical agent methods on the MedQA benchmark comprising US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) test questions. Our methods of simulacrum construction and agent evolution have the potential in benefiting a broad range of applications beyond medical AI.</description>

      <title>GRASP: A Grid-Based Benchmark for Evaluating Commonsense Spatial Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning, an important faculty of human cognition with many practical applications, is one of the core commonsense skills that is not purely language-based and, for satisfying (as opposed to optimal) solutions, requires some minimum degree of planning. Existing benchmarks of Commonsense Spatial Reasoning (CSR) tend to evaluate how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret text-based spatial $\textit{descriptions}$ rather than directly evaluate a plan produced by the LLM in response to a $\textit{specific}$ spatial reasoning problem. In this paper, we construct a large-scale benchmark called GRASP, which consists of 16,000 grid-based environments where the agent is tasked with an energy collection problem. These environments include 100 grid instances instantiated using each of the 160 different grid settings, involving five different energy distributions, two modes of agent starting position, and two distinct obstacle configurations, as well as three kinds of agent constraints. Using GRASP, we compare classic baseline approaches, such as random walk and greedy search methods, with advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-o1-mini. The experimental results indicate that even these advanced LLMs struggle to consistently achieve satisfactory solutions.</description>

      <title>XEQ Scale for Evaluating XAI Experience Quality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10662v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to improve the transparency of autonomous decision-making through explanations. Recent literature has emphasised users' need for holistic "multi-shot" explanations and personalised engagement with XAI systems. We refer to this user-centred interaction as an XAI Experience. Despite advances in creating XAI experiences, evaluating them in a user-centred manner has remained challenging. In response, we developed the XAI Experience Quality (XEQ) Scale. XEQ quantifies the quality of experiences across four dimensions: learning, utility, fulfilment and engagement. These contributions extend the state-of-the-art of XAI evaluation, moving beyond the one-dimensional metrics frequently developed to assess single-shot explanations. This paper presents the XEQ scale development and validation process, including content validation with XAI experts, and discriminant and construct validation through a large-scale pilot study. Our pilot study results offer strong evidence that establishes the XEQ Scale as a comprehensive framework for evaluating user-centred XAI experiences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) has enhanced game content creation, yet challenges in controllability and limited training data persist. This study addresses these issues by distilling a constructive PCG algorithm into a controllable PCGML model. We first generate a large amount of content with a constructive algorithm and label it using a Large Language Model (LLM). We use these synthetic labels to condition two PCGML models for content-specific generation, a diffusion model and the five-dollar model. This neural network distillation process ensures that the generation aligns with the original algorithm while introducing controllability through plain text. We define this text-conditioned PCGML as a Text-to-game-Map (T2M) task, offering an alternative to prevalent text-to-image multi-modal tasks. We compare our distilled models with the baseline constructive algorithm. Our analysis of the variety, accuracy, and quality of our generation demonstrates the efficacy of distilling constructive methods into controllable text-conditioned PCGML models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GraphRAG integrates (knowledge) graphs with large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning accuracy and contextual relevance. Despite its promising applications and strong relevance to multiple research communities, such as databases and natural language processing, GraphRAG currently lacks modular workflow analysis, systematic solution frameworks, and insightful empirical studies. To bridge these gaps, we propose LEGO-GraphRAG, a modular framework that enables: 1) fine-grained decomposition of the GraphRAG workflow, 2) systematic classification of existing techniques and implemented GraphRAG instances, and 3) creation of new GraphRAG instances. Our framework facilitates comprehensive empirical studies of GraphRAG on large-scale real-world graphs and diverse query sets, revealing insights into balancing reasoning quality, runtime efficiency, and token or GPU cost, that are essential for building advanced GraphRAG systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Propensity of Generative AI for Producing Harmful Disinformation During an Election Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06120v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence offers a powerful tool for adversaries who wish to engage in influence operations, such as the Chinese Spamouflage operation and the Russian Internet Research Agency effort that both sought to interfere with recent US election cycles. Therefore, this study seeks to investigate the propensity of current generative AI models for producing harmful disinformation during an election cycle. The probability that different generative AI models produced disinformation when given adversarial prompts was evaluated, in addition the associated harm. This allows for the expected harm for each model to be computed and it was discovered that Copilot and Gemini tied for the overall safest performance by realizing the lowest expected harm, while GPT-4o produced the greatest rates of harmful disinformation, resulting in much higher expected harm scores. The impact of disinformation category was also investigated and Gemini was safest within the political category of disinformation due to mitigation attempts made by developers during the election, while Copilot was safest for topics related to health. Moreover, characteristics of adversarial roles were discovered that led to greater expected harm across all models. Finally, classification models were developed that predicted disinformation production based on the conditions considered in this study, which offers insight into factors important for predicting disinformation production. Based on all of these insights, recommendations are provided that seek to mitigate factors that lead to harmful disinformation being produced by generative AI models. It is hoped that developers will use these insights to improve future models.</description>

Abstract: To address the sycophancy problem caused by reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models, this research applies synthetic data intervention technology to the decoder-only transformer architecture. Based on the research gaps in the existing literature, the researcher designed an experimental process to reduce the tendency of models to cater by generating diversified data, and used GPT4o as an experimental tool for verification. The experiment used 100 true and false questions, and compared the performance of the model trained with synthetic data intervention and the original untrained model on multiple indicators. The results show that the SDI training model supports the technology in terms of accuracy rate and sycophancy rate and has significant effectiveness in reducing sycophancy phenomena.

      <title>SEAL: Entangled White-box Watermarks on Low-Rank Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Recently, LoRA and its variants have become the de facto strategy for training and sharing task-specific versions of large pretrained models, thanks to their efficiency and simplicity. However, the issue of copyright protection for LoRA weights, especially through watermark-based techniques, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose SEAL (SEcure wAtermarking on LoRA weights), the universal whitebox watermarking for LoRA. SEAL embeds a secret, non-trainable matrix between trainable LoRA weights, serving as a passport to claim ownership. SEAL then entangles the passport with the LoRA weights through training, without extra loss for entanglement, and distributes the finetuned weights after hiding the passport. When applying SEAL, we observed no performance degradation across commonsense reasoning, textual/visual instruction tuning, and text-to-image synthesis tasks. We demonstrate that SEAL is robust against a variety of known attacks: removal, obfuscation, and ambiguity attacks.</description>

      <title>Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction tuning enhances large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions across diverse tasks, relying on high-quality datasets to guide behavior. However, these datasets, whether manually curated or synthetically generated, are often narrowly focused and misaligned with the broad distributions captured during pre-training, limiting LLM generalization and effective use of pre-trained knowledge. We propose *Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training* (AITP), a method that bridges this gap by identifying coverage shortfalls in instruction-tuning datasets and rewriting underrepresented pre-training data into high-quality instruction-response pairs. This approach enriches dataset diversity while preserving task-specific objectives. Evaluations on three fully open LLMs across eight benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements with AITP. Ablations highlight the benefits of adaptive data selection, controlled rewriting, and balanced integration, emphasizing the importance of aligning instruction tuning with pre-training distributions to unlock the full potential of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Towards Large Reasoning Models: A Survey on Scaling LLM Reasoning Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language has long been conceived as an essential tool for human reasoning. The breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in leveraging these models to tackle complex reasoning tasks. Researchers have moved beyond simple autoregressive token generation by introducing the concept of "thought" -- a sequence of tokens representing intermediate steps in the reasoning process. This innovative paradigm enables LLMs' to mimic complex human reasoning processes, such as tree search and reflective thinking. Recently, an emerging trend of learning to reason has applied reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to master reasoning processes. This approach enables the automatic generation of high-quality reasoning trajectories through trial-and-error search algorithms, significantly expanding LLMs' reasoning capacity by providing substantially more training data. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that encouraging LLMs to "think" with more tokens during test-time inference can further significantly boost reasoning accuracy. Therefore, the train-time and test-time scaling combined to show a new research frontier -- a path toward Large Reasoning Model. The introduction of OpenAI's o1 series marks a significant milestone in this research direction. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent progress in LLM reasoning. We begin by introducing the foundational background of LLMs and then explore the key technical components driving the development of large reasoning models, with a focus on automated data construction, learning-to-reason techniques, and test-time scaling. We also analyze popular open-source projects at building large reasoning models, and conclude with open challenges and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Icing Detection Model of Wind Turbine Blades Based on SCADA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.07914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diagnosis of ice accretion on wind turbine blades is all the time a hard nut to crack in condition monitoring of wind farms. Existing methods focus on mechanism analysis of icing process, deviation degree analysis of feature engineering. However, there have not been deep researches of neural networks applied in this field at present. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) makes it possible to train networks through continuously providing not only operation parameters and performance parameters of wind turbines but also environmental parameters and operation modes. This paper explores the possibility that using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs) and domain adaption learning to establish intelligent diagnosis frameworks under different training scenarios. Specifically, PGANC and PGANT are proposed for sufficient and non-sufficient target wind turbine labeled data, respectively. The basic idea is that we consider a two-stage training with parallel GANs, which are aimed at capturing intrinsic features for normal and icing samples, followed by classification CNN or domain adaption module in various training cases. Model validation on three wind turbine SCADA data shows that two-stage training can effectively improve the model performance. Besides, if there is no sufficient labeled data for a target turbine, which is an extremely common phenomenon in real industrial practices, the addition of domain adaption learning makes the trained model show better performance. Overall, our proposed intelligent diagnosis frameworks can achieve more accurate detection on the same wind turbine and more generalized capability on a new wind turbine, compared with other machine learning models and conventional CNNs.</description>

      <title>Neuradicon: operational representation learning of neuroimaging reports</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.10021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiological reports typically summarize the content and interpretation of imaging studies in unstructured form that precludes quantitative analysis. This limits the monitoring of radiological services to throughput undifferentiated by content, impeding specific, targeted operational optimization. Here we present Neuradicon, a natural language processing (NLP) framework for quantitative analysis of neuroradiological reports. Our framework is a hybrid of rule-based and artificial intelligence models to represent neurological reports in succinct, quantitative form optimally suited to operational guidance. We demonstrate the application of Neuradicon to operational phenotyping of a corpus of 336,569 reports, and report excellent generalizability across time and two independent healthcare institutions.</description>

      <title>Can AI-Generated Text be Reliably Detected?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform impressively well in various applications. However, the potential for misuse of these models in activities such as plagiarism, generating fake news, and spamming has raised concern about their responsible use. Consequently, the reliable detection of AI-generated text has become a critical area of research. AI text detectors have shown to be effective under their specific settings. In this paper, we stress-test the robustness of these AI text detectors in the presence of an attacker. We introduce recursive paraphrasing attack to stress test a wide range of detection schemes, including the ones using the watermarking as well as neural network-based detectors, zero shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors. Our experiments conducted on passages, each approximately 300 tokens long, reveal the varying sensitivities of these detectors to our attacks. Our findings indicate that while our recursive paraphrasing method can significantly reduce detection rates, it only slightly degrades text quality in many cases, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in current detection systems in the presence of an attacker. Additionally, we investigate the susceptibility of watermarked LLMs to spoofing attacks aimed at misclassifying human-written text as AI-generated. We demonstrate that an attacker can infer hidden AI text signatures without white-box access to the detection method, potentially leading to reputational risks for LLM developers. Finally, we provide a theoretical framework connecting the AUROC of the best possible detector to the Total Variation distance between human and AI text distributions. This analysis offers insights into the fundamental challenges of reliable detection as language models continue to advance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/vinusankars/Reliability-of-AI-text-detectors.</description>

      <title>Automated Machine Learning for Remaining Useful Life Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Being able to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of an engineering system is an important task in prognostics and health management. Recently, data-driven approaches to RUL predictions are becoming prevalent over model-based approaches since no underlying physical knowledge of the engineering system is required. Yet, this just replaces required expertise of the underlying physics with machine learning (ML) expertise, which is often also not available. Automated machine learning (AutoML) promises to build end-to-end ML pipelines automatically enabling domain experts without ML expertise to create their own models. This paper introduces AutoRUL, an AutoML-driven end-to-end approach for automatic RUL predictions. AutoRUL combines fine-tuned standard regression methods to an ensemble with high predictive power. By evaluating the proposed method on eight real-world and synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art hand-crafted models, we show that AutoML provides a viable alternative to hand-crafted data-driven RUL predictions. Consequently, creating RUL predictions can be made more accessible for domain experts using AutoML by eliminating ML expertise from data-driven model construction.</description>

      <title>Text-guided Image Restoration and Semantic Enhancement for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09059v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is to retrieve specific person images according to the given textual descriptions. A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</description>

      <title>Large Process Models: A Vision for Business Process Management in the Age of Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continued success of Large Language Models (LLMs) and other generative artificial intelligence approaches highlights the advantages that large information corpora can have over rigidly defined symbolic models, but also serves as a proof-point of the challenges that purely statistics-based approaches have in terms of safety and trustworthiness. As a framework for contextualizing the potential, as well as the limitations of LLMs and other foundation model-based technologies, we propose the concept of a Large Process Model (LPM) that combines the correlation power of LLMs with the analytical precision and reliability of knowledge-based systems and automated reasoning approaches. LPMs are envisioned to directly utilize the wealth of process management experience that experts have accumulated, as well as process performance data of organizations with diverse characteristics, e.g.,\ regarding size, region, or industry. In this vision, the proposed LPM would allow organizations to receive context-specific (tailored) process and other business models, analytical deep-dives, and improvement recommendations. As such, they would allow to substantially decrease the time and effort required for business transformation, while also allowing for deeper, more impactful, and more actionable insights than previously possible. We argue that implementing an LPM is feasible, but also highlight limitations and research challenges that need to be solved to implement particular aspects of the LPM vision.</description>

      <title>Assessing and Enhancing the Robustness of Large Language Models with Task Structure Variations for Logical Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09430v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as LLaMA, Alpaca, Vicuna, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, have advanced the performance of AI systems on various natural language processing tasks to human-like levels. However, their generalisation and robustness when performing logical reasoning has not been sufficiently assessed. To comprehensively evaluate this ability, we develop three new logical reasoning datasets named "ReClor-plus", "LogiQA-plus" and "LogiQAv2-plus" that extend standard logical reasoning datasets to evaluate the robustness of the LLM's reasoning. For each, we create three subsets: the first with randomly shuffled options, the second with the correct choices replaced by "none of the other options is correct", and the third with a combination of shuffling and substitution. Experiments on these datasets show that these simple augmentations greatly hinder the models' performance. Despite their high performance on the original publicly available datasets, we find that all models perform poorly on these newly constructed datasets. We also demonstrate that introducing task variations into the training set can markedly improve the model's performance on both the original and our developed datasets. Finally, we show that applying logic-driven data augmentation for fine-tuning and prompting can enhance generalisation in both discriminative and generative models, offering a path to improving their robustness for tasks involving logical reasoning. Source code and data are made publicly available at https://github.com/Strong-AI-Lab/Logical-and-abstract-reasoning.</description>

      <title>Harnessing small projectors and multiple views for efficient vision pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in self-supervised (SSL) visual representation learning has led to the development of several different proposed frameworks that rely on augmentations of images but use different loss functions. However, there are few theoretically grounded principles to guide practice, so practical implementation of each SSL framework requires several heuristics to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we build on recent analytical results to design practical recommendations for competitive and efficient SSL that are grounded in theory. Specifically, recent theory tells us that existing SSL frameworks are minimizing the same idealized loss, which is to learn features that best match the data similarity kernel defined by the augmentations used. We show how this idealized loss can be reformulated to a functionally equivalent loss that is more efficient to compute. We study the implicit bias of using gradient descent to minimize our reformulated loss function and find that using a stronger orthogonalization constraint with a reduced projector dimensionality should yield good representations. Furthermore, the theory tells us that approximating the reformulated loss should be improved by increasing the number of augmentations, and as such using multiple augmentations should lead to improved convergence. We empirically verify our findings on CIFAR, STL and Imagenet datasets, wherein we demonstrate an improved linear readout performance when training a ResNet-backbone using our theoretically grounded recommendations. Remarkably, we also demonstrate that by leveraging these insights, we can reduce the pretraining dataset size by up to 2$\times$ while maintaining downstream accuracy simply by using more data augmentations. Taken together, our work provides theoretically grounded recommendations that can be used to improve SSL convergence and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generate E-commerce Product Background by Integrating Category Commonality and Personalized Style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art methods for e-commerce product background generation suffer from the inefficiency of designing product-wise prompts when scaling up the production, as well as the ineffectiveness of describing fine-grained styles when customizing personalized backgrounds for some specific brands. To address these obstacles, we integrate the category commonality and personalized style into diffusion models. Concretely, we propose a Category-Wise Generator to enable large-scale background generation with only one model for the first time. A unique identifier in the prompt is assigned to each category, whose attention is located on the background by a mask-guided cross attention layer to learn the category-wise style. Furthermore, for products with specific and fine-grained requirements in layout, elements, etc, a Personality-Wise Generator is devised to learn such personalized style directly from a reference image to resolve textual ambiguities, and is trained in a self-supervised manner for more efficient training data usage. To advance research in this field, the first large-scale e-commerce product background generation dataset BG60k is constructed, which covers more than 60k product images from over 2k categories. Experiments demonstrate that our method could generate high-quality backgrounds for different categories, and maintain the personalized background style of reference images. BG60k will be available at \url{https://github.com/Whileherham/BG60k}.</description>

      <title>TraceFL: Interpretability-Driven Debugging in Federated Learning via Neuron Provenance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13632v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Federated Learning, clients train models on local data and send updates to a central server, which aggregates them into a global model using a fusion algorithm. This collaborative yet privacy-preserving training comes at a cost. FL developers face significant challenges in attributing global model predictions to specific clients. Localizing responsible clients is a crucial step towards (a) excluding clients primarily responsible for incorrect predictions and (b) encouraging clients who contributed high-quality models to continue participating in the future. Existing ML debugging approaches are inherently inapplicable as they are designed for single-model, centralized training.
  We introduce TraceFL, a fine-grained neuron provenance capturing mechanism that identifies clients responsible for a global model's prediction by tracking the flow of information from individual clients to the global model. Since inference on different inputs activates a different set of neurons of the global model, TraceFL dynamically quantifies the significance of the global model's neurons in a given prediction, identifying the most crucial neurons in the global model. It then maps them to the corresponding neurons in every participating client to determine each client's contribution, ultimately localizing the responsible client. We evaluate TraceFL on six datasets, including two real-world medical imaging datasets and four neural networks, including advanced models such as GPT. TraceFL achieves 99% accuracy in localizing the responsible client in FL tasks spanning both image and text classification tasks. At a time when state-of-the-artML debugging approaches are mostly domain-specific (e.g., image classification only), TraceFL is the first technique to enable highly accurate automated reasoning across a wide range of FL applications.</description>

      <title>Two Types of AI Existential Risk: Decisive and Accumulative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional discourse on existential risks (x-risks) from AI typically focuses on abrupt, dire events caused by advanced AI systems, particularly those that might achieve or surpass human-level intelligence. These events have severe consequences that either lead to human extinction or irreversibly cripple human civilization to a point beyond recovery. This discourse, however, often neglects the serious possibility of AI x-risks manifesting incrementally through a series of smaller yet interconnected disruptions, gradually crossing critical thresholds over time. This paper contrasts the conventional "decisive AI x-risk hypothesis" with an "accumulative AI x-risk hypothesis." While the former envisions an overt AI takeover pathway, characterized by scenarios like uncontrollable superintelligence, the latter suggests a different causal pathway to existential catastrophes. This involves a gradual accumulation of critical AI-induced threats such as severe vulnerabilities and systemic erosion of economic and political structures. The accumulative hypothesis suggests a boiling frog scenario where incremental AI risks slowly converge, undermining societal resilience until a triggering event results in irreversible collapse. Through systems analysis, this paper examines the distinct assumptions differentiating these two hypotheses. It is then argued that the accumulative view can reconcile seemingly incompatible perspectives on AI risks. The implications of differentiating between these causal pathways -- the decisive and the accumulative -- for the governance of AI as well as long-term AI safety are discussed.</description>

      <title>Keeping LLMs Aligned After Fine-tuning: The Crucial Role of Prompt Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public LLMs such as the Llama 2-Chat underwent alignment training and were considered safe. Recently Qi et al. [2024] reported that even benign fine-tuning on seemingly safe datasets can give rise to unsafe behaviors in the models. The current paper is about methods and best practices to mitigate such loss of alignment. We focus on the setting where a public model is fine-tuned before serving users for specific usage, where the model should improve on the downstream task while maintaining alignment. Through extensive experiments on several chat models (Meta's Llama 2-Chat, Mistral AI's Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo), this paper uncovers that the prompt templates used during fine-tuning and inference play a crucial role in preserving safety alignment, and proposes the ``Pure Tuning, Safe Testing'' (PTST) strategy -- fine-tune models without a safety prompt, but include it at test time. This seemingly counterintuitive strategy incorporates an intended distribution shift to encourage alignment preservation. Fine-tuning experiments on GSM8K, ChatDoctor, and OpenOrca show that PTST significantly reduces the rise of unsafe behaviors.</description>

      <title>Bridging Diversity and Uncertainty in Active learning with Self-Supervised Pre-Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the integration of diversity-based and uncertainty-based sampling strategies in active learning, particularly within the context of self-supervised pre-trained models. We introduce a straightforward heuristic called TCM that mitigates the cold start problem while maintaining strong performance across various data levels. By initially applying TypiClust for diversity sampling and subsequently transitioning to uncertainty sampling with Margin, our approach effectively combines the strengths of both strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that TCM consistently outperforms existing methods across various datasets in both low and high data regimes.</description>

      <title>Aligning with Human Judgement: The Role of Pairwise Preference in Large Language Model Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16950v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities as automatic evaluators in assessing the quality of generated natural language. However, LLMs still exhibit biases in evaluation and often struggle to generate coherent evaluations that align with human assessments. In this work, we first conduct a systematic study of the misalignment between LLM evaluators and human evaluation, revealing that existing calibration methods aimed at mitigating biases of LLMs are insufficient for effectively aligning LLM evaluators. Inspired by the use of preference data in RLHF, we formulate the evaluation as a ranking problem and introduce Pairwise-preference Search (PAIRS), an uncertainty-guided search-based rank aggregation method that employs LLMs to conduct pairwise comparisons locally and efficiently ranks candidate texts globally. PAIRS achieves state-of-the-art performance on representative evaluation tasks in long-form generations and demonstrates significant improvements over direct scoring. Furthermore, we provide insights into the role of pairwise preference in quantifying the transitivity of LLMs and demonstrate how PAIRS benefits from calibration using debiased pairwise evaluations.</description>

      <title>ELITR-Bench: A Meeting Assistant Benchmark for Long-Context Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently witnessed an increasing interest in extending the models' context size to better capture dependencies within long documents. While benchmarks have been proposed to assess long-range abilities, existing efforts primarily considered generic tasks that are not necessarily aligned with real-world applications. In contrast, we propose a new benchmark for long-context LLMs focused on a practical meeting assistant scenario in which the long contexts consist of transcripts obtained by automatic speech recognition, presenting unique challenges for LLMs due to the inherent noisiness and oral nature of such data. Our benchmark, ELITR-Bench, augments the existing ELITR corpus by adding 271 manually crafted questions with their ground-truth answers, as well as noisy versions of meeting transcripts altered to target different Word Error Rate levels. Our experiments with 12 long-context LLMs on ELITR-Bench confirm the progress made across successive generations of both proprietary and open models, and point out their discrepancies in terms of robustness to transcript noise. We also provide a thorough analysis of our GPT-4-based evaluation, including insights from a crowdsourcing study. Our findings indicate that while GPT-4's scores align with human judges, its ability to distinguish beyond three score levels may be limited.</description>

      <title>NL2KQL: From Natural Language to Kusto Query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02933v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data is growing rapidly in volume and complexity. Proficiency in database query languages is pivotal for crafting effective queries. As coding assistants become more prevalent, there is significant opportunity to enhance database query languages. The Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a widely used query language for large semi-structured data such as logs, telemetries, and time-series for big data analytics platforms. This paper introduces NL2KQL an innovative framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to convert natural language queries (NLQs) to KQL queries. The proposed NL2KQL framework includes several key components: Schema Refiner which narrows down the schema to its most pertinent elements; the Few-shot Selector which dynamically selects relevant examples from a few-shot dataset; and the Query Refiner which repairs syntactic and semantic errors in KQL queries. Additionally, this study outlines a method for generating large datasets of synthetic NLQ-KQL pairs which are valid within a specific database contexts. To validate NL2KQL's performance, we utilize an array of online (based on query execution) and offline (based on query parsing) metrics. Through ablation studies, the significance of each framework component is examined, and the datasets used for benchmarking are made publicly available. This work is the first of its kind and is compared with available baselines to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Mitigating analytical variability in fMRI results with style transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging results by converting statistic maps across different functional MRI pipelines. We make the assumption that pipelines used to compute fMRI statistic maps can be considered as a style component and we propose to use different generative models, among which, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Diffusion Models (DM) to convert statistic maps across different pipelines. We explore the performance of multiple GAN frameworks, and design a new DM framework for unsupervised multi-domain styletransfer. We constrain the generation of 3D fMRI statistic maps using the latent space of an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes statistic maps from different pipelines and extend traditional sampling techniques used in DM to improve the transition performance. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods aresuccessful: pipelines can indeed be transferred as a style component, providing animportant source of data augmentation for future medical studies.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Design Space of Dataset Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13733v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dataset condensation, a concept within data-centric learning, efficiently transfers critical attributes from an original dataset to a synthetic version, maintaining both diversity and realism. This approach significantly improves model training efficiency and is adaptable across multiple application areas. Previous methods in dataset condensation have faced challenges: some incur high computational costs which limit scalability to larger datasets (e.g., MTT, DREAM, and TESLA), while others are restricted to less optimal design spaces, which could hinder potential improvements, especially in smaller datasets (e.g., SRe2L, G-VBSM, and RDED). To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive design framework that includes specific, effective strategies like implementing soft category-aware matching and adjusting the learning rate schedule. These strategies are grounded in empirical evidence and theoretical backing. Our resulting approach, Elucidate Dataset Condensation (EDC), establishes a benchmark for both small and large-scale dataset condensation. In our testing, EDC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reaching 48.6% on ImageNet-1k with a ResNet-18 model at an IPC of 10, which corresponds to a compression ratio of 0.78%. This performance exceeds those of SRe2L, G-VBSM, and RDED by margins of 27.3%, 17.2%, and 6.6%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Generative AI in Cybersecurity: A Comprehensive Review of LLM Applications and Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of the future of cybersecurity through Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). We explore LLM applications across various domains, including hardware design security, intrusion detection, software engineering, design verification, cyber threat intelligence, malware detection, and phishing detection. We present an overview of LLM evolution and its current state, focusing on advancements in models such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x7B, BERT, Falcon2, and LLaMA. Our analysis extends to LLM vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection, insecure output handling, data poisoning, DDoS attacks, and adversarial instructions. We delve into mitigation strategies to protect these models, providing a comprehensive look at potential attack scenarios and prevention techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of 42 LLM models in cybersecurity knowledge and hardware security, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We thoroughly evaluate cybersecurity datasets for LLM training and testing, covering the lifecycle from data creation to usage and identifying gaps for future research. In addition, we review new strategies for leveraging LLMs, including techniques like Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ), Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These insights aim to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses and improve the sophistication of LLM applications in threat detection and response. Our paper provides a foundational understanding and strategic direction for integrating LLMs into future cybersecurity frameworks, emphasizing innovation and robust model deployment to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.</description>

      <title>News Without Borders: Domain Adaptation of Multilingual Sentence Embeddings for Cross-lingual News Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapidly growing numbers of multilingual news consumers pose an increasing challenge to news recommender systems in terms of providing customized recommendations. First, existing neural news recommenders, even when powered by multilingual language models (LMs), suffer substantial performance losses in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (ZS-XLT). Second, the current paradigm of fine-tuning the backbone LM of a neural recommender on task-specific data is computationally expensive and infeasible in few-shot recommendation and cold-start setups, where data is scarce or completely unavailable. In this work, we propose a news-adapted sentence encoder (NaSE), domain-specialized from a pretrained massively multilingual sentence encoder (SE). To this end, we construct and leverage PolyNews and PolyNewsParallel, two multilingual news-specific corpora. With the news-adapted multilingual SE in place, we test the effectiveness of (i.e., question the need for) supervised fine-tuning for news recommendation, and propose a simple and strong baseline based on (i) frozen NaSE embeddings and (ii) late click-behavior fusion. We show that NaSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-XLT in true cold-start and few-shot news recommendation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale data collections in the wild, are invariably noisy. Thus developing data pruning strategies that remain robust even in the presence of corruption is critical in practice. In this work, we propose Geometric Median ($\gm$) Matching -- a herding style greedy algorithm that yields a $k$-subset such that the mean of the subset approximates the geometric median of the (potentially) noisy dataset. Theoretically, we show that $\gm$ Matching enjoys an improved $\gO(1/k)$ scaling over $\gO(1/\sqrt{k})$ scaling of uniform sampling; while achieving {\bf optimal breakdown point} of {\bf 1/2} even under {\bf arbitrary} corruption. Extensive experiments across several popular deep learning benchmarks indicate that $\gm$ Matching consistently improves over prior state-of-the-art; the gains become more profound at high rates of corruption and aggressive pruning rates; making $\gm$ Matching a strong baseline for future research in robust data pruning.</description>

Abstract: We argue for the epistemic and ethical advantages of pluralism in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in the context of Large Language Models (LLM). Drawing on social epistemology and pluralist philosophy of science, we suggest ways in which RHLF can be made more responsive to human needs and how we can address challenges along the way.

      <description>arXiv:2408.08881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical Image Foundation Models have proven to be powerful tools for mask prediction across various datasets. However, accurately assessing the uncertainty of their predictions remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a new model, U-MedSAM, which integrates the MedSAM model with an uncertainty-aware loss function and the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SharpMin) optimizer. The uncertainty-aware loss function automatically combines region-based, distribution-based, and pixel-based loss designs to enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness. SharpMin improves generalization by finding flat minima in the loss landscape, thereby reducing overfitting. Our method was evaluated in the CVPR24 MedSAM on Laptop challenge, where U-MedSAM demonstrated promising performance.</description>

      <title>RLPF: Reinforcement Learning from Prediction Feedback for User Summarization with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-powered personalization agent systems employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict users' behavior from their past activities. However, their effectiveness often hinges on the ability to effectively leverage extensive, long user historical data due to its inherent noise and length of such data. Existing pretrained LLMs may generate summaries that are concise but lack the necessary context for downstream tasks, hindering their utility in personalization systems. To address these challenges, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Prediction Feedback (RLPF). RLPF fine-tunes LLMs to generate concise, human-readable user summaries that are optimized for downstream task performance. By maximizing the usefulness of the generated summaries, RLPF effectively distills extensive user history data while preserving essential information for downstream tasks. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in both extrinsic downstream task utility and intrinsic summary quality, surpassing baseline methods by up to 22% on downstream task performance and achieving an up to 84.59% win rate on Factuality, Abstractiveness, and Readability. RLPF also achieves a remarkable 74% reduction in context length while improving performance on 16 out of 19 unseen tasks and/or datasets, showcasing its generalizability. This approach offers a promising solution for enhancing LLM personalization by effectively transforming long, noisy user histories into informative and human-readable representations.</description>

      <title>Audio-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Head-Orientation in Naturalistic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10048</link>

Abstract: Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches in audio signal processing have seen substantial progress in recent years, audio-driven DRL for tasks such as navigation, gaze control and head-orientation control in the context of human-robot interaction have received little attention. Here, we propose an audio-driven DRL framework in which we utilise deep Q-learning to develop an autonomous agent that orients towards a talker in the acoustic environment based on stereo speech recordings. Our results show that the agent learned to perform the task at a near perfect level when trained on speech segments in anechoic environments (that is, without reverberation). The presence of reverberation in naturalistic acoustic environments affected the agent's performance, although the agent still substantially outperformed a baseline, randomly acting agent. Finally, we quantified the degree of generalization of the proposed DRL approach across naturalistic acoustic environments. Our experiments revealed that policies learned by agents trained on medium or high reverb environments generalized to low reverb environments, but policies learned by agents trained on anechoic or low reverb environments did not generalize to medium or high reverb environments. Taken together, this study demonstrates the potential of audio-driven DRL for tasks such as head-orientation control and highlights the need for training strategies that enable robust generalization across environments for real-world audio-driven DRL applications.</description>

      <title>AgRegNet: A Deep Regression Network for Flower and Fruit Density Estimation, Localization, and Counting in Orchards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the major challenges for the agricultural industry today is the uncertainty in manual labor availability and the associated cost. Automated flower and fruit density estimation, localization, and counting could help streamline harvesting, yield estimation, and crop-load management strategies such as flower and fruitlet thinning. This article proposes a deep regression-based network, AgRegNet, to estimate density, count, and location of flower and fruit in tree fruit canopies without explicit object detection or polygon annotation. Inspired by popular U-Net architecture, AgRegNet is a U-shaped network with an encoder-to-decoder skip connection and modified ConvNeXt-T as an encoder feature extractor. AgRegNet can be trained based on information from point annotation and leverages segmentation information and attention modules (spatial and channel) to highlight relevant flower and fruit features while suppressing non-relevant background features. Experimental evaluation in apple flower and fruit canopy images under an unstructured orchard environment showed that AgRegNet achieved promising accuracy as measured by Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), percentage Mean Absolute Error (pMAE) and mean Average Precision (mAP) to estimate flower and fruit density, count, and centroid location, respectively. Specifically, the SSIM, pMAE, and mAP values for flower images were 0.938, 13.7%, and 0.81, respectively. For fruit images, the corresponding values were 0.910, 5.6%, and 0.93. Since the proposed approach relies on information from point annotation, it is suitable for sparsely and densely located objects. This simplified technique will be highly applicable for growers to accurately estimate yields and decide on optimal chemical and mechanical flower thinning practices.</description>

      <title>T3: A Novel Zero-shot Transfer Learning Framework Iteratively Training on an Assistant Task for a Target Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long text summarization, gradually being essential for efficiently processing large volumes of information, stays challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA families because of the insufficient open-sourced training datasets and the high requirement of contextual details dealing. To address the issue, we design a novel zero-shot transfer learning framework, abbreviated as T3, to iteratively training a baseline LLM on an assistant task for the target task, where the former should own richer data resources and share structural or semantic similarity with the latter. In practice, T3 is approached to deal with the long text summarization task by utilizing question answering as the assistant task, and further validated its effectiveness on the BBC summary, NarraSum, FairytaleQA, and NLQuAD datasets, with up to nearly 14% improvement in ROUGE, 35% improvement in BLEU, and 16% improvement in Factscore compared to three baseline LLMs, demonstrating its potential for more assistant-target task combinations.</description>

      <title>LLM Hallucinations in Practical Code Generation: Phenomena, Mechanism, and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code generation aims to automatically generate code from input requirements, significantly enhancing development efficiency. Recent large language models (LLMs) based approaches have shown promising results and revolutionized code generation task. Despite the promising performance, LLMs often generate contents with hallucinations, especially for the code generation scenario requiring the handling of complex contextual dependencies in practical development process. Although previous study has analyzed hallucinations in LLM-powered code generation, the study is limited to standalone function generation. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to study the phenomena, mechanism, and mitigation of LLM hallucinations within more practical and complex development contexts in repository-level generation scenario. First, we manually examine the code generation results from six mainstream LLMs to establish a hallucination taxonomy of LLM-generated code. Next, we elaborate on the phenomenon of hallucinations, analyze their distribution across different models. We then analyze causes of hallucinations and identify four potential factors contributing to hallucinations. Finally, we propose an RAG-based mitigation method, which demonstrates consistent effectiveness in all studied LLMs. The replication package including code, data, and experimental results is available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/LLMCodingHallucination</description>

      <title>A Complete Characterization of Learnability for Stochastic Noisy Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic noisy bandit problem with an unknown reward function $f^*$ in a known function class $\mathcal{F}$. Formally, a model $M$ maps arms $\pi$ to a probability distribution $M(\pi)$ of reward. A model class $\mathcal{M}$ is a collection of models. For each model $M$, define its mean reward function $f^M(\pi)=\mathbb{E}_{r \sim M(\pi)}[r]$. In the bandit learning problem, we proceed in rounds, pulling one arm $\pi$ each round and observing a reward sampled from $M(\pi)$. With knowledge of $\mathcal{M}$, supposing that the true model $M\in \mathcal{M}$, the objective is to identify an arm $\hat{\pi}$ of near-maximal mean reward $f^M(\hat{\pi})$ with high probability in a bounded number of rounds. If this is possible, then the model class is said to be learnable.
  Importantly, a result of \cite{hanneke2023bandit} shows there exist model classes for which learnability is undecidable. However, the model class they consider features deterministic rewards, and they raise the question of whether learnability is decidable for classes containing sufficiently noisy models. For the first time, we answer this question in the positive by giving a complete characterization of learnability for model classes with arbitrary noise. In addition to that, we also describe the full spectrum of possible optimal query complexities. Further, we prove adaptivity is sometimes necessary to achieve the optimal query complexity. Last, we revisit an important complexity measure for interactive decision making, the Decision-Estimation-Coefficient \citep{foster2021statistical,foster2023tight}, and propose a new variant of the DEC which also characterizes learnability in this setting.</description>

      <title>Deep Compression Autoencoder for Efficient High-Resolution Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10733v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencoder models for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder. Our code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/efficientvit.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantization for Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in machine learning community proposed multiple methods for performing lossy compression (quantization) of large matrices. This quantization is important for accelerating matrix multiplication (main component of large language models), which is often bottlenecked by the speed of loading these matrices from memory. Unlike classical vector quantization and rate-distortion theory, the goal of these new compression algorithms is to be able to approximate not the matrices themselves, but their matrix product. Specifically, given a pair of real matrices $A,B$ an encoder (compressor) is applied to each of them independently producing descriptions with $R$ bits per entry. These representations subsequently are used by the decoder to estimate matrix product $A^\top B$. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic lower bound on the mean squared error of this approximation (as a function of rate $R$) for the case of matrices $A,B$ with iid Gaussian entries. Algorithmically, we construct a universal quantizer based on nested lattices with an explicit guarantee of approximation error for any (non-random) pair of matrices $A$, $B$ in terms of only Frobenius norms $\|\bar{A}\|_F, \|\bar{B}\|_F$ and $\|\bar{A}^\top \bar{B}\|_F$, where $\bar{A},\bar{B}$ are versions of $A,B$ with zero-centered columns, respectively. For iid Gaussian matrices our quantizer achieves the lower bound and is, thus, asymptotically optimal. A practical low-complexity version of our quantizer achieves performance quite close to optimal. In addition, we derive rate-distortion function for matrix multiplication of iid Gaussian matrices, which exhibits an interesting phase-transition at $R\approx 0.906$ bit/entry.</description>

      <title>A Mechanistic Explanatory Strategy for XAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in XAI, scholars note a persistent lack of solid conceptual foundations and integration with broader scientific discourse on explanation. In response, emerging XAI research draws on explanatory strategies from various sciences and philosophy of science literature to fill these gaps. This paper outlines a mechanistic strategy for explaining the functional organization of deep learning systems, situating recent advancements in AI explainability within a broader philosophical context. According to the mechanistic approach, the explanation of opaque AI systems involves identifying mechanisms that drive decision-making. For deep neural networks, this means discerning functionally relevant components -- such as neurons, layers, circuits, or activation patterns -- and understanding their roles through decomposition, localization, and recomposition. Proof-of-principle case studies from image recognition and language modeling align these theoretical approaches with the latest research from AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic. This research suggests that a systematic approach to studying model organization can reveal elements that simpler (or ''more modest'') explainability techniques might miss, fostering more thoroughly explainable AI. The paper concludes with a discussion on the epistemic relevance of the mechanistic approach positioned in the context of selected philosophical debates on XAI.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Upstream Anticipatory Traffic Signal Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordination in traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in urban networks. Existing pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate upstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased network delays. However, effective signal control inherently requires coordination across a broader spatial scope, as the effect of upstream traffic should influence signal control decisions at downstream intersections, impacting a large area in the traffic network. Although agent communication using neural network-based feature extraction can implicitly enhance spatial awareness, it significantly increases the learning complexity, adding an additional layer of difficulty to the challenging task of control in deep reinforcement learning. To address the issue of learning complexity and myopic traffic pressure definition, our work introduces a novel concept based on Markov chain theory, namely \textit{multi-hop upstream pressure}, which generalizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond the immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the deep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the multi-hop upstream queues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial awareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios demonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly reduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a broader understanding of upstream congestion.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Study of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Robust Autonomous Highway Ramp Entry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicles today can drive themselves on highways and driverless robotaxis operate in major cities, with more sophisticated levels of autonomous driving expected to be available and become more common in the future. Yet, technically speaking, so-called "Level 5" (L5) operation, corresponding to full autonomy, has not been achieved. For that to happen, functions such as fully autonomous highway ramp entry must be available, and provide provably safe, and reliably robust behavior to enable full autonomy. We present a systematic study of a highway ramp function that controls the vehicles forward-moving actions to minimize collisions with the stream of highway traffic into which a merging (ego) vehicle enters. We take a game-theoretic multi-agent (MA) approach to this problem and study the use of controllers based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The virtual environment of the MA DRL uses self-play with simulated data where merging vehicles safely learn to control longitudinal position during a taper-type merge. The work presented in this paper extends existing work by studying the interaction of more than two vehicles (agents) and does so by systematically expanding the road scene with additional traffic and ego vehicles. While previous work on the two-vehicle setting established that collision-free controllers are theoretically impossible in fully decentralized, non-coordinated environments, we empirically show that controllers learned using our approach are nearly ideal when measured against idealized optimal controllers.</description>

      <title>VLSBench: Unveiling Visual Leakage in Multimodal Safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety concerns of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gradually become an important problem in various applications. Surprisingly, previous works indicate a counter-intuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to align MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs trained with image-text pairs. To explain such a counter-intuitive phenomenon, we discover a visual safety information leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety benchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky and sensitive content in the image has been revealed in the textual query. In this way, MLLMs can easily refuse these sensitive text-image queries according to textual queries. However, image-text pairs without VSIL are common in real-world scenarios and are overlooked by existing multimodal safety benchmarks. To this end, we construct multimodal visual leakless safety benchmark (VLSBench) preventing visual safety leakage from image to textual query with 2.4k image-text pairs. Experimental results indicate that VLSBench poses a significant challenge to both open-source and close-source MLLMs, including LLaVA, Qwen2-VL, Llama3.2-Vision, and GPT-4o. This study demonstrates that textual alignment is enough for multimodal safety scenarios with VSIL, while multimodal alignment is a more promising solution for multimodal safety scenarios without VSIL.

      <title>BatchLLM: Optimizing Large Batched LLM Inference with Global Prefix Sharing and Throughput-oriented Token Batching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly play an important role in a wide range of information processing and management tasks. Many of these tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix between requests. The KV context that are about to be reused may prematurely evicted with the implicit cache management. Besides, the streaming oriented systems do not leverage the request-batch information and can not mix the decoding tokens with the prefill chunks to the best for the batched scenarios, and thus fails to saturate the GPU. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks, and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Finally, BatchLLM optimizes the prefix-shared Attention kernel with horizontal fusion to reduce tail effect and kernel launch overhead. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM and SGLang by 1.3$\times$ to 10.8$\times$ on a set of microbenchmarks and a typical industry workload under different hardware environments.</description>

Abstract: Applying language models (LMs) to tables is challenging due to the inherent structural differences between two-dimensional tables and one-dimensional text for which the LMs were originally designed. Furthermore, when applying linearized tables to LMs, the maximum token lengths often imposed in self-attention calculations make it difficult to comprehensively understand the context spread across large tables. To address these challenges, we present PieTa (Piece of Table), a new framework for sub-table-based question answering (QA). PieTa operates through an iterative process of dividing tables into smaller windows, using LMs to select relevant cells within each window, and merging these cells into a sub-table. This multi-resolution approach captures dependencies across multiple rows and columns while avoiding the limitations caused by long context inputs. Instantiated as a simple iterative sub-table union algorithm, PieTa demonstrates improved performance over previous sub-table-based QA approaches.</description>

      <title>Enabling Low-Resource Language Retrieval: Establishing Baselines for Urdu MS MARCO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the Information Retrieval (IR) field increasingly recognizes the importance of inclusivity, addressing the needs of low-resource languages remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the first large-scale Urdu IR dataset, created by translating the MS MARCO dataset through machine translation. We establish baseline results through zero-shot learning for IR in Urdu and subsequently apply the mMARCO multilingual IR methodology to this newly translated dataset. Our findings demonstrate that the fine-tuned model (Urdu-mT5-mMARCO) achieves a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@10) of 0.247 and a Recall@10 of 0.439, representing significant improvements over zero-shot results and showing the potential for expanding IR access for Urdu speakers. By bridging access gaps for speakers of low-resource languages, this work not only advances multilingual IR research but also emphasizes the ethical and societal importance of inclusive IR technologies. This work provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions for improving language representation and lays the groundwork for future research, especially in South Asian languages, which can benefit from the adaptable methods used in this study.</description>

      <title>AceMath: Advancing Frontier Math Reasoning with Post-Training and Reward Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce AceMath, a suite of frontier math models that excel in solving complex math problems, along with highly effective reward models capable of evaluating generated solutions and reliably identifying the correct ones. To develop the instruction-tuned math models, we propose a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process that first achieves competitive performance across general domains, followed by targeted fine-tuning for the math domain using a carefully curated set of prompts and synthetically generated responses. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-Instruct greatly outperforms Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 Sonnet. To develop math-specialized reward model, we first construct AceMath-RewardBench, a comprehensive and robust benchmark for evaluating math reward models across diverse problems and difficulty levels. After that, we present a systematic approach to build our math reward models. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-RM, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reward models. Furthermore, when combining AceMath-72B-Instruct with AceMath-72B-RM, we achieve the highest average rm@8 score across the math reasoning benchmarks. We release model weights, training data, and evaluation benchmarks at: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/acemath</description>

      <title>MRI2Speech: Speech Synthesis from Articulatory Movements Recorded by Real-time MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous real-time MRI (rtMRI)-based speech synthesis models depend heavily on noisy ground-truth speech. Applying loss directly over ground truth mel-spectrograms entangles speech content with MRI noise, resulting in poor intelligibility. We introduce a novel approach that adapts the multi-modal self-supervised AV-HuBERT model for text prediction from rtMRI and incorporates a new flow-based duration predictor for speaker-specific alignment. The predicted text and durations are then used by a speech decoder to synthesize aligned speech in any novel voice. We conduct thorough experiments on two datasets and demonstrate our method's generalization ability to unseen speakers. We assess our framework's performance by masking parts of the rtMRI video to evaluate the impact of different articulators on text prediction. Our method achieves a $15.18\%$ Word Error Rate (WER) on the USC-TIMIT MRI corpus, marking a huge improvement over the current state-of-the-art.

      <title>Cold-Start Recommendation towards the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs): A Comprehensive Survey and Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold-start problem is one of the long-standing challenges in recommender systems, focusing on accurately modeling new or interaction-limited users or items to provide better recommendations. Due to the diversification of internet platforms and the exponential growth of users and items, the importance of cold-start recommendation (CSR) is becoming increasingly evident. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success and possess strong capabilities in modeling user and item information, providing new potential for cold-start recommendations. However, the research community on CSR still lacks a comprehensive review and reflection in this field. Based on this, in this paper, we stand in the context of the era of large language models and provide a comprehensive review and discussion on the roadmap, related literature, and future directions of CSR. Specifically, we have conducted an exploration of the development path of how existing CSR utilizes information, from content features, graph relations, and domain information, to the world knowledge possessed by large language models, aiming to provide new insights for both the research and industrial communities on CSR. Related resources of cold-start recommendations are collected and continuously updated for the community in https://github.com/YuanchenBei/Awesome-Cold-Start-Recommendation.</description>

      <title>Model Alignment Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When can we say that two neural systems are the same? The answer to this question is goal-dependent, and it is often addressed through correlative methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). What do we miss when we forgo causal explorations, and how can we target specific types of similarity? In this work, we introduce Model Alignment Search (MAS), a method for causally exploring distributed representational similarity. The method learns invertible linear transformations that align a subspace between two distributed networks' representations where causal information can be freely interchanged. We first show that the method can be used to transfer specific causal variables, such as the number of items in a counting task, between networks with different training seeds. We then explore open questions in number cognition by comparing different types of numeric representations in models trained on structurally different numeric tasks. We then explore differences between MAS vs preexisting causal similarity methods, and lastly, we introduce a counterfactual latent auxiliary loss function that helps shape causally relevant alignments even in cases where we do not have causal access to one of the two models for training.</description>

      <title>Tarsier2: Advancing Large Vision-Language Models from Detailed Video Description to Comprehensive Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Tarsier2, a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM) designed for generating detailed and accurate video descriptions, while also exhibiting superior general video understanding capabilities. Tarsier2 achieves significant advancements through three key upgrades: (1) Scaling pre-training data from 11M to 40M video-text pairs, enriching both volume and diversity; (2) Performing fine-grained temporal alignment during supervised fine-tuning; (3) Using model-based sampling to automatically construct preference data and applying DPO training for optimization. Extensive experiments show that Tarsier2-7B consistently outperforms leading proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, in detailed video description tasks. On the DREAM-1K benchmark, Tarsier2-7B improves F1 by 2.8\% over GPT-4o and 5.8\% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. In human side-by-side evaluations, Tarsier2-7B shows a +8.6\% performance advantage over GPT-4o and +24.9\% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. Tarsier2-7B also sets new state-of-the-art results across 15 public benchmarks, spanning tasks such as video question-answering, video grounding, hallucination test, and embodied question-answering, demonstrating its versatility as a robust generalist vision-language model.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model is Secretly a Protein Sequence Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the protein sequence engineering problem, which aims to find protein sequences with high fitness levels, starting from a given wild-type sequence. Directed evolution has been a dominating paradigm in this field which has an iterative process to generate variants and select via experimental feedback. We demonstrate large language models (LLMs), despite being trained on massive texts, are secretly protein sequence optimizers. With a directed evolutionary method, LLM can perform protein engineering through Pareto and experiment-budget constrained optimization, demonstrating success on both synthetic and experimental fitness landscapes.</description>

      <title>On Learning Informative Trajectory Embeddings for Imitation, Classification and Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world sequential decision making tasks like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, learning from observed state-action trajectories is critical for tasks like imitation, classification, and clustering. For example, self-driving cars must replicate human driving behaviors, while robots and healthcare systems benefit from modeling decision sequences, whether or not they come from expert data. Existing trajectory encoding methods often focus on specific tasks or rely on reward signals, limiting their ability to generalize across domains and tasks. Inspired by the success of embedding models like CLIP and BERT in static domains, we propose a novel method for embedding state-action trajectories into a latent space that captures the skills and competencies in the dynamic underlying decision-making processes. This method operates without the need for reward labels, enabling better generalization across diverse domains and tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a trajectory embedding approach that captures multiple abilities from state-action data. (2) The learned embeddings exhibit strong representational power across downstream tasks, including imitation, classification, clustering, and regression. (3) The embeddings demonstrate unique properties, such as controlling agent behaviors in IQ-Learn and an additive structure in the latent space. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms traditional approaches, offering more flexible and powerful trajectory representations for various applications.

      <title>Neural Honeytrace: A Robust Plug-and-Play Watermarking Framework against Model Extraction Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing high-performance deep learning models is resource-intensive, leading model owners to utilize Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms instead of publicly releasing their models. However, malicious users may exploit query interfaces to execute model extraction attacks, reconstructing the target model's functionality locally. While prior research has investigated triggerable watermarking techniques for asserting ownership, existing methods face significant challenges: (1) most approaches require additional training, resulting in high overhead and limited flexibility, and (2) they often fail to account for advanced attackers, leaving them vulnerable to adaptive attacks.
  In this paper, we propose Neural Honeytrace, a robust plug-and-play watermarking framework against model extraction attacks. We first formulate a watermark transmission model from an information-theoretic perspective, providing an interpretable account of the principles and limitations of existing triggerable watermarking. Guided by the model, we further introduce: (1) a similarity-based training-free watermarking method for plug-and-play and flexible watermarking, and (2) a distribution-based multi-step watermark information transmission strategy for robust watermarking. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that Neural Honeytrace outperforms previous methods in efficiency and resisting adaptive attacks. Neural Honeytrace reduces the average number of samples required for a worst-case t-Test-based copyright claim from $12,000$ to $200$ with zero training cost.</description>
