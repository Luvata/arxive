      <title>ECLAIR: Enhanced Clarification for Interactive Responses in an Enterprise AI Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in understanding and generating natural language across various applications. However, they often struggle with resolving ambiguities in real-world, enterprise-level interactions, where context and domain-specific knowledge play a crucial role. In this demonstration, we introduce ECLAIR (Enhanced CLArification for Interactive Responses), a multi-agent framework for interactive disambiguation. ECLAIR enhances ambiguous user query clarification through an interactive process where custom agents are defined, ambiguity reasoning is conducted by the agents, clarification questions are generated, and user feedback is leveraged to refine the final response. When tested on real-world customer data, ECLAIR demonstrates significant improvements in clarification question generation compared to standard few-shot methods.</description>

      <title>Can Zero-Shot Commercial APIs Deliver Regulatory-Grade Clinical Text DeIdentification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically assess the performance of three leading API-based de-identification systems - Azure Health Data Services, AWS Comprehend Medical, and OpenAI GPT-4o - against our de-identification systems on a ground truth dataset of 48 clinical documents annotated by medical experts. Our analysis, conducted at both entity-level and token-level, demonstrates that our solution, Healthcare NLP, achieves the highest accuracy, with a 96% F1-score in protected health information (PHI) detection, significantly outperforming Azure (91%), AWS (83%), and GPT-4o (79%). Beyond accuracy, Healthcare NLP is also the most cost-effective solution, reducing processing costs by over 80% compared to Azure and GPT-4o. Its fixed-cost local deployment model avoids the escalating per-request fees of cloud-based services, making it a scalable and economical choice. Our results underscore a critical limitation: zero-shot commercial APIs fail to meet the accuracy, adaptability, and cost-efficiency required for regulatory-grade clinical de-identification. Healthcare NLP's superior performance, customization capabilities, and economic advantages position it as the more viable solution for healthcare organizations seeking compliance and scalability in clinical NLP workflows.</description>

      <title>"Whose Side Are You On?" Estimating Ideology of Political and News Content Using Large Language Models and Few-shot Demonstration Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of social media platforms has led to concerns about radicalization, filter bubbles, and content bias. Existing approaches to classifying ideology are limited in that they require extensive human effort, the labeling of large datasets, and are not able to adapt to evolving ideological contexts. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for classifying the political ideology of online content in the context of the two-party US political spectrum through in-context learning (ICL). Our extensive experiments involving demonstration selection in label-balanced fashion, conducted on three datasets comprising news articles and YouTube videos, reveal that our approach significantly outperforms zero-shot and traditional supervised methods. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of metadata (e.g., content source and descriptions) on ideological classification and discuss its implications. Finally, we show how providing the source for political and non-political content influences the LLM's classification.</description>

      <title>SE-GNN: Seed Expanded-Aware Graph Neural Network with Iterative Optimization for Semi-supervised Entity Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entity alignment aims to use pre-aligned seed pairs to find other equivalent entities from different knowledge graphs (KGs) and is widely used in graph fusion-related fields. However, as the scale of KGs increases, manually annotating pre-aligned seed pairs becomes difficult. Existing research utilizes entity embeddings obtained by aggregating single structural information to identify potential seed pairs, thus reducing the reliance on pre-aligned seed pairs. However, due to the structural heterogeneity of KGs, the quality of potential seed pairs obtained using only a single structural information is not ideal. In addition, although existing research improves the quality of potential seed pairs through semi-supervised iteration, they underestimate the impact of embedding distortion produced by noisy seed pairs on the alignment effect. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a seed expanded-aware graph neural network with iterative optimization for semi-supervised entity alignment, named SE-GNN. First, we utilize the semantic attributes and structural features of entities, combined with a conditional filtering mechanism, to obtain high-quality initial potential seed pairs. Next, we designed a local and global awareness mechanism. It introduces initial potential seed pairs and combines local and global information to obtain a more comprehensive entity embedding representation, which alleviates the impact of KGs structural heterogeneity and lays the foundation for the optimization of initial potential seed pairs. Then, we designed the threshold nearest neighbor embedding correction strategy. It combines the similarity threshold and the bidirectional nearest neighbor method as a filtering mechanism to select iterative potential seed pairs and also uses an embedding correction strategy to eliminate the embedding distortion.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Manuscript Assessment with Text Summarization Using 69707 articles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and efficient assessment of the future impact of research articles is a significant concern for both authors and reviewers. The most common standard for measuring the impact of academic papers is the number of citations. In recent years, numerous efforts have been undertaken to predict citation counts within various citation windows. However, most of these studies focus solely on a specific academic field or require early citation counts for prediction, rendering them impractical for the early-stage evaluation of papers. In this work, we harness Scopus to curate a significantly comprehensive and large-scale dataset of information from 69707 scientific articles sourced from 99 journals spanning multiple disciplines. We propose a deep learning methodology for the impact-based classification tasks, which leverages semantic features extracted from the manuscripts and paper metadata. To summarize the semantic features, such as titles and abstracts, we employ a Transformer-based language model to encode semantic features and design a text fusion layer to capture shared information between titles and abstracts. We specifically focus on the following impact-based prediction tasks using information of scientific manuscripts in pre-publication stage: (1) The impact of journals in which the manuscripts will be published. (2) The future impact of manuscripts themselves. Extensive experiments on our datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model for impact-based prediction tasks. We also demonstrate potentials in generating manuscript's feedback and improvement suggestions.</description>

      <title>Named Entity Recognition in Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Named Entity Recognition system developed by the Edit Dunhuang team for the EvaHan2025 competition. Our approach integrates three core components: (1) Pindola, a modern transformer-based bidirectional encoder pretrained on a large corpus of Classical Chinese texts; (2) a retrieval module that fetches relevant external context for each target sequence; and (3) a generative reasoning step that summarizes retrieved context in Classical Chinese for more robust entity disambiguation. Using this approach, we achieve an average F1 score of 85.58, improving upon the competition baseline by nearly 5 points.</description>

      <title>Both Direct and Indirect Evidence Contribute to Dative Alternation Preferences in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) tend to show human-like preferences on a number of syntactic phenomena, but the extent to which these are attributable to direct exposure to the phenomena or more general properties of language is unclear. We explore this with the English dative alternation (DO: "gave Y the X" vs. PO: "gave the X to Y"), using a controlled rearing paradigm wherein we iteratively train small LMs on systematically manipulated input. We focus on properties that affect the choice of alternant: length and animacy. Both properties are directly present in datives but also reflect more global tendencies for shorter elements to precede longer ones and animates to precede inanimates. First, by manipulating and ablating datives for these biases in the input, we show that direct evidence of length and animacy matters, but easy-first preferences persist even without such evidence. Then, using LMs trained on systematically perturbed datasets to manipulate global length effects (re-linearizing sentences globally while preserving dependency structure), we find that dative preferences can emerge from indirect evidence. We conclude that LMs' emergent syntactic preferences come from a mix of direct and indirect sources.</description>

      <title>GatedxLSTM: A Multimodal Affective Computing Approach for Emotion Recognition in Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) is essential for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with emotion recognition serving as a key component. However, human emotions are inherently dynamic, influenced not only by an individual's expressions but also by interactions with others, and single-modality approaches often fail to capture their full dynamics. Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) leverages multiple signals but traditionally relies on utterance-level analysis, overlooking the dynamic nature of emotions in conversations. Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) addresses this limitation, yet existing methods struggle to align multimodal features and explain why emotions evolve within dialogues. To bridge this gap, we propose GatedxLSTM, a novel speech-text multimodal ERC model that explicitly considers voice and transcripts of both the speaker and their conversational partner(s) to identify the most influential sentences driving emotional shifts. By integrating Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) for improved cross-modal alignment and employing a gating mechanism to emphasise emotionally impactful utterances, GatedxLSTM enhances both interpretability and performance. Additionally, the Dialogical Emotion Decoder (DED) refines emotion predictions by modelling contextual dependencies. Experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that GatedxLSTM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source methods in four-class emotion classification. These results validate its effectiveness for ERC applications and provide an interpretability analysis from a psychological perspective.</description>

      <title>Hacia la interpretabilidad de la detecci\'on anticipada de riesgos de depresi\'on utilizando grandes modelos de lenguaje</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early Detection of Risks (EDR) on the Web involves identifying at-risk users as early as possible. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven to solve various linguistic tasks efficiently, assessing their reasoning ability in specific domains is crucial. In this work, we propose a method for solving depression-related EDR using LLMs on Spanish texts, with responses that can be interpreted by humans. We define a reasoning criterion to analyze users through a specialist, apply in-context learning to the Gemini model, and evaluate its performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results show that accurate predictions can be obtained, supported by explanatory reasoning, providing a deeper understanding of the solution. Our approach offers new perspectives for addressing EDR problems by leveraging the power of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Clean &amp; Clear: Feasibility of Safe LLM Clinical Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background:
  Clinical guidelines are central to safe evidence-based medicine in modern healthcare, providing diagnostic criteria, treatment options and monitoring advice for a wide range of illnesses. LLM-empowered chatbots have shown great promise in Healthcare Q&amp;A tasks, offering the potential to provide quick and accurate responses to medical inquiries.
  Our main objective was the development and preliminary assessment of an LLM-empowered chatbot software capable of reliably answering clinical guideline questions using University College London Hospital (UCLH) clinical guidelines.
  Methods: We used the open-weight Llama-3.1-8B LLM to extract relevant information from the UCLH guidelines to answer questions. Our approach highlights the safety and reliability of referencing information over its interpretation and response generation. Seven doctors from the ward assessed the chatbot's performance by comparing its answers to the gold standard.
  Results: Our chatbot demonstrates promising performance in terms of relevance, with ~73% of its responses rated as very relevant, showcasing a strong understanding of the clinical context. Importantly, our chatbot achieves a recall of 0.98 for extracted guideline lines, substantially minimising the risk of missing critical information. Approximately 78% of responses were rated satisfactory in terms of completeness. A small portion (~14.5%) contained minor unnecessary information, indicating occasional lapses in precision. The chatbot' showed high efficiency, with an average completion time of 10 seconds, compared to 30 seconds for human respondents. Evaluation of clinical reasoning showed that 72% of the chatbot's responses were without flaws. Our chatbot demonstrates significant potential to speed up and improve the process of accessing locally relevant clinical information for healthcare professionals.</description>

      <title>Sociotechnical Effects of Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the previous chapters have shown how machine translation (MT) can be useful, in this chapter we discuss some of the side-effects and risks that are associated, and how they might be mitigated. With the move to neural MT and approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an associated impact on climate change, as the models built by multinational corporations are massive. They are hugely expensive to train, consume large amounts of electricity, and output huge volumes of kgCO2 to boot. However, smaller models which still perform to a high level of quality can be built with much lower carbon footprints, and tuning pre-trained models saves on the requirement to train from scratch. We also discuss the possible detrimental effects of MT on translators and other users. The topics of copyright and ownership of data are discussed, as well as ethical considerations on data and MT use. Finally, we show how if done properly, using MT in crisis scenarios can save lives, and we provide a method of how this might be done.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Framing Analysis of News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated frame analysis of political communication is a popular task in computational social science that is used to study how authors select aspects of a topic to frame its reception. So far, such studies have been narrow, in that they use a fixed set of pre-defined frames and focus only on the text, ignoring the visual contexts in which those texts appear. Especially for framing in the news, this leaves out valuable information about editorial choices, which include not just the written article but also accompanying photographs. To overcome such limitations, we present a method for conducting multi-modal, multi-label framing analysis at scale using large (vision-)language models. Grounding our work in framing theory, we extract latent meaning embedded in images used to convey a certain point and contrast that to the text by comparing the respective frames used. We also identify highly partisan framing of topics with issue-specific frame analysis found in prior qualitative work. We demonstrate a method for doing scalable integrative framing analysis of both text and image in news, providing a more complete picture for understanding media bias.</description>

      <title>ScreenLLM: Stateful Screen Schema for Efficient Action Understanding and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents are autonomous systems that interpret and generate actions, enabling intelligent user assistance and automation. Effective training of these agent presents unique challenges, such as sparsity in supervision signals, scalability for large datasets, and the need for nuanced user understanding. We propose stateful screen schema, an efficient representation of GUI interactions that captures key user actions and intentions over time. Building on this foundation, we introduce ScreenLLM, a set of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) tailored for advanced UI understanding and action prediction. Extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models show that ScreenLLM accurately models user behavior and predicts actions. Our work lays the foundation for scalable, robust, and intelligent GUI agents that enhance user interaction in diverse software environments.</description>

      <title>Patients Speak, AI Listens: LLM-based Analysis of Online Reviews Uncovers Key Drivers for Urgent Care Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the public experience of urgent care facilities is essential for promoting community healthcare development. Traditional survey methods often fall short due to limited scope, time, and spatial coverage. Crowdsourcing through online reviews or social media offers a valuable approach to gaining such insights. With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), extracting nuanced perceptions from reviews has become feasible. This study collects Google Maps reviews across the DMV and Florida areas and conducts prompt engineering with the GPT model to analyze the aspect-based sentiment of urgent care. We first analyze the geospatial patterns of various aspects, including interpersonal factors, operational efficiency, technical quality, finances, and facilities. Next, we determine Census Block Group(CBG)-level characteristics underpinning differences in public perception, including population density, median income, GINI Index, rent-to-income ratio, household below poverty rate, no insurance rate, and unemployment rate. Our results show that interpersonal factors and operational efficiency emerge as the strongest determinants of patient satisfaction in urgent care, while technical quality, finances, and facilities show no significant independent effects when adjusted for in multivariate models. Among socioeconomic and demographic factors, only population density demonstrates a significant but modest association with patient ratings, while the remaining factors exhibit no significant correlations. Overall, this study highlights the potential of crowdsourcing to uncover the key factors that matter to residents and provide valuable insights for stakeholders to improve public satisfaction with urgent care.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal State-Space Graph Reasoning for Structured Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to extract compact, meaningful summaries from large-scale and multimodal data is critical for numerous applications, ranging from video analytics to medical reports. Prior methods in cross-modal summarization have often suffered from high computational overheads and limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a \textit{Cross-Modal State-Space Graph Reasoning} (\textbf{CSS-GR}) framework that incorporates a state-space model with graph-based message passing, inspired by prior work on efficient state-space models. Unlike existing approaches relying on purely sequential models, our method constructs a graph that captures inter- and intra-modal relationships, allowing more holistic reasoning over both textual and visual streams. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves summarization quality and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency, as validated on standard multimodal summarization benchmarks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to highlight the contributions of each component.</description>

      <title>Multi-head Reward Aggregation Guided by Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with safety guidelines typically involves reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), relying on human-generated preference annotations. However, assigning consistent overall quality ratings is challenging, prompting recent research to shift towards detailed evaluations based on multiple specific safety criteria. This paper uncovers a consistent observation: safety rules characterized by high rating entropy are generally less reliable in identifying responses preferred by humans. Leveraging this finding, we introduce ENCORE, a straightforward entropy-guided approach that composes multi-head rewards by downweighting rules exhibiting high rating entropy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that rules with elevated entropy naturally receive minimal weighting in the Bradley-Terry optimization framework, justifying our entropy-based penalization. Through extensive experiments on RewardBench safety tasks, our method significantly surpasses several competitive baselines, including random weighting, uniform weighting, single-head Bradley-Terry models, and LLM-based judging methods. Our proposed approach is training-free, broadly applicable to various datasets, and maintains interpretability, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-attribute reward modeling.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models for Automated Clinical Abstraction in Pulmonary Embolism Registries: Performance Across Model Sizes, Versions, and Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality, yet our understanding of optimal management remains limited due to heterogeneous and inaccessible radiology documentation. The PERT Consortium registry standardizes PE management data but depends on resource-intensive manual abstraction. Large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative for automating concept extraction from computed tomography PE (CTPE) reports. This study evaluated the accuracy of LLMs in extracting PE-related concepts compared to a human-curated criterion standard. We retrospectively analyzed MIMIC-IV and Duke Health CTPE reports using multiple LLaMA models. Larger models (70B) outperformed smaller ones (8B), achieving kappa values of 0.98 (PE detection), 0.65-0.75 (PE location), 0.48-0.51 (right heart strain), and 0.65-0.70 (image artifacts). Moderate temperature tuning (0.2-0.5) improved accuracy, while excessive in-context examples reduced performance. A dual-model review framework achieved &gt;80-90% precision. LLMs demonstrate strong potential for automating PE registry abstraction, minimizing manual workload while preserving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Predict Associations Among Human Attitudes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can predict human attitudes based on other attitudes, but this work has largely focused on predictions from highly similar and interrelated attitudes. In contrast, human attitudes are often strongly associated even across disparate and dissimilar topics. Using a novel dataset of human responses toward diverse attitude statements, we found that a frontier language model (GPT-4o) was able to recreate the pairwise correlations among individual attitudes and to predict individuals' attitudes from one another. Crucially, in an advance over prior work, we tested GPT-4o's ability to predict in the absence of surface-similarity between attitudes, finding that while surface similarity improves prediction accuracy, the model was still highly-capable of generating meaningful social inferences between dissimilar attitudes. Altogether, our findings indicate that LLMs capture crucial aspects of the deeper, latent structure of human belief systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Korean Dependency Parsing with Morphosyntactic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces UniDive for Korean, an integrated framework that bridges Universal Dependencies (UD) and Universal Morphology (UniMorph) to enhance the representation and processing of Korean {morphosyntax}. Korean's rich inflectional morphology and flexible word order pose challenges for existing frameworks, which often treat morphology and syntax separately, leading to inconsistencies in linguistic analysis. UniDive unifies syntactic and morphological annotations by preserving syntactic dependencies while incorporating UniMorph-derived features, improving consistency in annotation. We construct an integrated dataset and apply it to dependency parsing, demonstrating that enriched morphosyntactic features enhance parsing accuracy, particularly in distinguishing grammatical relations influenced by morphology. Our experiments, conducted with both encoder-only and decoder-only models, confirm that explicit morphological information contributes to more accurate syntactic analysis.</description>

      <title>Shared Global and Local Geometry of Language Model Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have recently suggested that models share common representations. In this work, we find that the token embeddings of language models exhibit common geometric structure. First, we find ``global'' similarities: token embeddings often share similar relative orientations. Next, we characterize local geometry in two ways: (1) by using Locally Linear Embeddings, and (2) by defining a simple measure for the intrinsic dimension of each token embedding. Our intrinsic dimension measure demonstrates that token embeddings lie on a lower dimensional manifold. We qualitatively show that tokens with lower intrinsic dimensions often have semantically coherent clusters, while those with higher intrinsic dimensions do not. Both characterizations allow us to find similarities in the local geometry of token embeddings. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that alignment in token embeddings persists through the hidden states of language models, allowing us to develop an application for interpretability. Namely, we empirically demonstrate that steering vectors from one language model can be transferred to another, despite the two models having different dimensions.</description>

      <title>EQ-Negotiator: An Emotion-Reasoning LLM Agent in Credit Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have been applied for effective engagement in credit dialogues, their capacity for dynamic emotional expression remains limited. Current agents primarily rely on passive empathy rather than affective reasoning. For instance, when faced with persistent client negativity, the agent should employ strategic emotional adaptation by expressing measured anger to discourage counterproductive behavior and guide the conversation toward resolution. This context-aware emotional modulation is essential for imitating the nuanced decision-making of human negotiators. This paper introduces an EQ-negotiator that combines emotion sensing from pre-trained language models (PLMs) with emotional reasoning based on Game Theory and Hidden Markov Models. It takes into account both the current and historical emotions of the client to better manage and address negative emotions during interactions. By fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on public emotion datasets and validating them on the credit dialogue datasets, our approach enables LLM-based agents to effectively capture shifts in client emotions and dynamically adjust their response tone based on our emotion decision policies in real-world financial negotiations. This EQ-negotiator can also help credit agencies foster positive client relationships, enhancing satisfaction in credit services.</description>

      <title>ZJUKLAB at SemEval-2025 Task 4: Unlearning via Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the ZJUKLAB team's submission for SemEval-2025 Task 4: Unlearning Sensitive Content from Large Language Models. This task aims to selectively erase sensitive knowledge from large language models, avoiding both over-forgetting and under-forgetting issues. We propose an unlearning system that leverages Model Merging (specifically TIES-Merging), combining two specialized models into a more balanced unlearned model. Our system achieves competitive results, ranking second among 26 teams, with an online score of 0.944 for Task Aggregate and 0.487 for overall Aggregate. In this paper, we also conduct local experiments and perform a comprehensive analysis of the unlearning process, examining performance trajectories, loss dynamics, and weight perspectives, along with several supplementary experiments, to understand the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we analyze the shortcomings of our method and evaluation metrics, emphasizing that MIA scores and ROUGE-based metrics alone are insufficient to fully evaluate successful unlearning. Finally, we emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation methodologies and rethinking of unlearning objectives in future research.

      <title>Function Alignment: A New Theory for Mind and Intelligence, Part I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces function alignment, a novel theory of mind and intelligence that is both intuitively compelling and structurally grounded. It explicitly models how meaning, interpretation, and analogy emerge from interactions among layered representations, forming a coherent framework capable not only of modeling minds but also of serving as a blueprint for building them. One of the key theoretical insights derived from function alignment is bounded interpretability, which provides a unified explanation for previously fragmented ideas in cognitive science, such as bounded rationality, symbol grounding, and analogy-making. Beyond modeling, the function alignment framework bridges disciplines often kept apart, linking computational architecture, psychological theory, and even contemplative traditions such as Zen. Rather than building on any philosophical systems, it offers a structural foundation upon which multiple ways of understanding the mind may be reconstructed.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Risk Assessment in Hyperconnected Logistic Hub Network Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental sustainability in global supply chains introduces new challenges in the deployment of hyperconnected logistic hub networks. In current volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environments, dynamic risk assessment becomes essential to ensure successful hub deployment. However, traditional methods often struggle to effectively capture and analyze unstructured information. In this paper, we design an Large Language Model (LLM)-driven risk assessment pipeline integrated with multiple analytical tools to evaluate logistic hub deployment. This framework enables LLMs to systematically identify potential risks by analyzing unstructured data, such as geopolitical instability, financial trends, historical storm events, traffic conditions, and emerging risks from news sources. These data are processed through a suite of analytical tools, which are automatically called by LLMs to support a structured and data-driven decision-making process for logistic hub selection. In addition, we design prompts that instruct LLMs to leverage these tools for assessing the feasibility of hub selection by evaluating various risk types and levels. Through risk-based similarity analysis, LLMs cluster logistic hubs with comparable risk profiles, enabling a structured approach to risk assessment. In conclusion, the framework incorporates scalability with long-term memory and enhances decision-making through explanation and interpretation, enabling comprehensive risk assessments for logistic hub deployment in hyperconnected supply chain networks.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Evolution: Multi-Round Learning Between Large and Small Language Models for Emergent Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms has exerted a substantial influence on society, leading to discernible impacts and deleterious consequences. Conventional deep learning methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from the necessity for extensive supervised training and the challenge of adapting to rapidly evolving circumstances. Large language models (LLMs), despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, have fallen short in effectively identifying fake news due to a lack of pertinent demonstrations and the dynamic nature of knowledge. In this paper, a novel framework Multi-Round Collaboration Detection (MRCD) is proposed to address these aforementioned limitations. The MRCD framework is capable of enjoying the merits from both LLMs and SLMs by integrating their generalization abilities and specialized functionalities, respectively. Our approach features a two-stage retrieval module that selects relevant and up-to-date demonstrations and knowledge, enhancing in-context learning for better detection of emerging news events. We further design a multi-round learning framework to ensure more reliable detection results. Our framework MRCD achieves SOTA results on two real-world datasets Pheme and Twitter16, with accuracy improvements of 7.4\% and 12.8\% compared to using only SLMs, which effectively addresses the limitations of current models and improves the detection of emergent fake news.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce UGen, a unified autoregressive multimodal model that demonstrates strong performance across text processing, image understanding, and image generation tasks simultaneously. UGen converts both texts and images into discrete token sequences and utilizes a single transformer to generate them uniformly in an autoregressive manner. To address the challenges associated with unified multimodal learning, UGen is trained using a novel mechanism, namely progressive vocabulary learning. In this process, visual token IDs are incrementally activated and integrated into the training phase, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of unified multimodal learning. Experiments on comprehensive text and image tasks show that UGen achieves a significant overall performance improvement of 13.3% compared to the vanilla unified autoregressive method, and it also delivers competitive results across all tasks against several task-specific models.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-CMoE: Towards Continual Mixture of Experts for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although applying Mixture of Experts to large language models for learning new tasks is widely regarded as an effective strategy for continuous learning, there still remain two major challenges: (1) As the number of tasks grows, simple parameter expansion strategies can lead to excessively large models. (2) Modifying the parameters of the existing router results in the erosion of previously acquired knowledge. In this paper, we present an innovative framework named LLaVA-CMoE, which is a continuous Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture without any replay data. Specifically, we have developed a method called Probe-Guided Knowledge Extension (PGKE), which employs probe experts to assess whether additional knowledge is required for a specific layer. This approach enables the model to adaptively expand its network parameters based on task distribution, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of parameter expansion. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical routing algorithm called Probabilistic Task Locator (PTL), where high-level routing captures inter-task information and low-level routing focuses on intra-task details, ensuring that new task experts do not interfere with existing ones. Our experiments shows that our efficient architecture has substantially improved model performance on the Coin benchmark while maintaining a reasonable parameter count.</description>

      <title>ResearchBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Inspiration-Based Task Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting scientific research, yet their ability to discover high-quality research hypotheses remains unexamined due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs with a near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking. We develop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy. To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in 2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge associations. This positions LLMs as "research hypothesis mines", capable of facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses at scale with minimal human intervention.</description>

      <title>Cultivating Game Sense for Yourself: Making VLMs Gaming Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing agents capable of fluid gameplay in first/third-person games without API access remains a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recent efforts leverage Vision Language Models (VLMs) as direct controllers, frequently pausing the game to analyze screens and plan action through language reasoning. However, this inefficient paradigm fundamentally restricts agents to basic and non-fluent interactions: relying on isolated VLM reasoning for each action makes it impossible to handle tasks requiring high reactivity (e.g., FPS shooting) or dynamic adaptability (e.g., ACT combat). To handle this, we propose a paradigm shift in gameplay agent design: instead of directly controlling gameplay, VLM develops specialized execution modules tailored for tasks like shooting and combat. These modules handle real-time game interactions, elevating VLM to a high-level developer. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce GameSense, a gameplay agent framework where VLM develops task-specific game sense modules by observing task execution and leveraging vision tools and neural network training pipelines. These modules encapsulate action-feedback logic, ranging from direct action rules to neural network-based decisions. Experiments demonstrate that our framework is the first to achieve fluent gameplay in diverse genres, including ACT, FPS, and Flappy Bird, setting a new benchmark for game-playing agents.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably make mistakes when performing step-by-step mathematical reasoning. Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising solution by evaluating each reasoning step. However, existing PRMs typically output evaluation scores directly, limiting both learning efficiency and evaluation accuracy, which is further exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated data. To address these issues, we propose Reasoning-Driven Process Reward Modeling (R-PRM). First, we leverage stronger LLMs to generate seed data from limited annotations, effectively bootstrapping our model's reasoning capabilities and enabling comprehensive step-by-step evaluation. Second, we further enhance performance through preference optimization, without requiring additional annotated data. Third, we introduce inference-time scaling to fully harness the model's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate R-PRM's effectiveness: on ProcessBench and PRMBench, it surpasses strong baselines by 11.9 and 8.5 points in F1 scores, respectively. When applied to guide mathematical reasoning, R-PRM achieves consistent accuracy improvements of over 8.5 points across six challenging datasets. Further analysis reveals that R-PRM exhibits more comprehensive evaluation and stronger generalization capabilities, thereby highlighting its significant potential.</description>

      <title>ReFeed: Multi-dimensional Summarization Refinement with Reflective Reasoning on Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summarization refinement faces challenges when extending to multi-dimension. In this paper, we introduce ReFeed, a powerful summarization refinement pipeline that enhances multiple dimensions through reflective reasoning on feedback. To achieve this, we release SumFeed-CoT, a large-scale Long-CoT-based dataset optimized for training a lightweight model with reflective reasoning. Our experiments reveal how the number of dimensions, feedback exposure, and reasoning policy influence refinement performance, highlighting reflective reasoning and simultaneously addressing multiple feedback is crucial to mitigate trade-off between dimensions. Furthermore, ReFeed is robust to noisy feedback and feedback order. Lastly, our finding emphasizes that creating data with a proper goal and guideline constitutes a fundamental pillar of effective reasoning. The dataset and model will be released.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning LLMs on Small Medical Datasets: Text Classification and Normalization Effectiveness on Cardiology reports and Discharge records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on small medical datasets for text classification and named entity recognition tasks. Using a German cardiology report dataset and the i2b2 Smoking Challenge dataset, we demonstrate that fine-tuning small LLMs locally on limited training data can improve performance achieving comparable results to larger models. Our experiments show that fine-tuning improves performance on both tasks, with notable gains observed with as few as 200-300 training examples. Overall, the study highlights the potential of task-specific fine-tuning of LLMs for automating clinical workflows and efficiently extracting structured data from unstructured medical text.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate user preferences into energy optimization constraints for home appliances. We describe a task where natural language user utterances are converted into formal constraints for smart appliances, within the broader context of a renewable energy community (REC) and in the Italian scenario. We evaluate the effectiveness of various LLMs currently available for Italian in translating these preferences resorting to classical zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning settings, using a pilot dataset of Italian user requests paired with corresponding formal constraint representation. Our contributions include establishing a baseline performance for this task, publicly releasing the dataset and code for further research, and providing insights on observed best practices and limitations of LLMs in this particular domain</description>

      <title>Retrieving Time-Series Differences Using Natural Language Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively searching time-series data is essential for system analysis; however, traditional methods often require domain expertise to define search criteria. Recent advancements have enabled natural language-based search, but these methods struggle to handle differences between time-series data. To address this limitation, we propose a natural language query-based approach for retrieving pairs of time-series data based on differences specified in the query. Specifically, we define six key characteristics of differences, construct a corresponding dataset, and develop a contrastive learning-based model to align differences between time-series data with query texts. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall mAP score of 0.994 in retrieving time-series pairs.</description>

      <title>Challenging the Boundaries of Reasoning: An Olympiad-Level Math Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of large reasoning models has resulted in the saturation of existing benchmarks for evaluating mathematical reasoning, highlighting the urgent need for more challenging and rigorous evaluation frameworks. To address this gap, we introduce OlymMATH, a novel Olympiad-level mathematical benchmark, designed to rigorously test the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs. OlymMATH features 200 meticulously curated problems, each manually verified and available in parallel English and Chinese versions. The problems are systematically organized into two distinct difficulty tiers: (1) AIME-level problems (easy) that establish a baseline for mathematical reasoning assessment, and (2) significantly more challenging problems (hard) designed to push the boundaries of current state-of-the-art models. In our benchmark, these problems span four core mathematical fields, each including a verifiable numerical solution to enable objective, rule-based evaluation. Empirical results underscore the significant challenge presented by OlymMATH, with state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini demonstrating notably limited accuracy on the hard subset. Furthermore, the benchmark facilitates comprehensive bilingual assessment of mathematical reasoning abilities-a critical dimension that remains largely unaddressed in mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks. We release the OlymMATH benchmark at the STILL project: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Slow_Thinking_with_LLMs.</description>

      <title>Controlling Large Language Model with Latent Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks using Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective approach. However, LLMs do not inherently define the structure of an agent for RL training, particularly in terms of defining the action space. This paper studies learning a compact latent action space to enhance the controllability and exploration of RL for LLMs. We propose Controlling Large Language Models with Latent Actions (CoLA), a framework that integrates a latent action space into pre-trained LLMs. We apply CoLA to the Llama-3.1-8B model. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to RL with token-level actions, CoLA's latent action enables greater semantic diversity in text generation. For enhancing downstream tasks, we show that CoLA with RL achieves a score of 42.4 on the math500 benchmark, surpassing the baseline score of 38.2, and reaches 68.2 when augmented with a Monte Carlo Tree Search variant. Furthermore, CoLA with RL consistently improves performance on agent-based tasks without degrading the pre-trained LLM's capabilities, unlike the baseline. Finally, CoLA reduces computation time by half in tasks involving enhanced thinking prompts for LLMs by RL. These results highlight CoLA's potential to advance RL-based adaptation of LLMs for downstream applications.</description>

      <title>An evaluation of LLMs and Google Translate for translation of selected Indian languages via sentiment and semantic analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have been prominent for language translation, including low-resource languages. There has been limited study about the assessment of the quality of translations generated by LLMs, including Gemini, GPT and Google Translate. In this study, we address this limitation by using semantic and sentiment analysis of selected LLMs for Indian languages, including Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi. We select prominent texts that have been well translated by experts and use LLMs to generate their translations to English, and then we provide a comparison with selected expert (human) translations. Our findings suggest that while LLMs have made significant progress in translation accuracy, challenges remain in preserving sentiment and semantic integrity, especially in figurative and philosophical contexts. The sentiment analysis revealed that GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 are better at preserving the sentiments for the Bhagavad Gita (Sanskrit-English) translations when compared to Google Translate. We observed a similar trend for the case of Tamas (Hindi-English) and Maha P (Telugu-English) translations. GPT-4o performs similarly to GPT-3.5 in the translation in terms of sentiments for the three languages. We found that LLMs are generally better at translation for capturing sentiments when compared to Google Translate.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agent: A Survey on Methodology, Applications and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The era of intelligent agents is upon us, driven by revolutionary advancements in large language models. Large Language Model (LLM) agents, with goal-driven behaviors and dynamic adaptation capabilities, potentially represent a critical pathway toward artificial general intelligence. This survey systematically deconstructs LLM agent systems through a methodology-centered taxonomy, linking architectural foundations, collaboration mechanisms, and evolutionary pathways. We unify fragmented research threads by revealing fundamental connections between agent design principles and their emergent behaviors in complex environments. Our work provides a unified architectural perspective, examining how agents are constructed, how they collaborate, and how they evolve over time, while also addressing evaluation methodologies, tool applications, practical challenges, and diverse application domains. By surveying the latest developments in this rapidly evolving field, we offer researchers a structured taxonomy for understanding LLM agents and identify promising directions for future research.

      <title>Harnessing Chain-of-Thought Metadata for Task Routing and Adversarial Prompt Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a metric called Number of Thoughts (NofT) to determine the difficulty of tasks pre-prompting and support Large Language Models (LLMs) in production contexts. By setting thresholds based on the number of thoughts, this metric can discern the difficulty of prompts and support more effective prompt routing. A 2% decrease in latency is achieved when routing prompts from the MathInstruct dataset through quantized, distilled versions of Deepseek with 1.7 billion, 7 billion, and 14 billion parameters. Moreover, this metric can be used to detect adversarial prompts used in prompt injection attacks with high efficacy. The Number of Thoughts can inform a classifier that achieves 95% accuracy in adversarial prompt detection. Our experiments ad datasets used are available on our GitHub page: https://github.com/rymarinelli/Number_Of_Thoughts/tree/main.</description>

      <title>OmniVox: Zero-Shot Emotion Recognition with Omni-LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of omni-LLMs (large language models that accept any modality as input), particularly for multimodal cognitive state tasks involving speech, is understudied. We present OmniVox, the first systematic evaluation of four omni-LLMs on the zero-shot emotion recognition task. We evaluate on two widely used multimodal emotion benchmarks: IEMOCAP and MELD, and find zero-shot omni-LLMs outperform or are competitive with fine-tuned audio models. Alongside our audio-only evaluation, we also evaluate omni-LLMs on text only and text and audio. We present acoustic prompting, an audio-specific prompting strategy for omni-LLMs which focuses on acoustic feature analysis, conversation context analysis, and step-by-step reasoning. We compare our acoustic prompting to minimal prompting and full chain-of-thought prompting techniques. We perform a context window analysis on IEMOCAP and MELD, and find that using context helps, especially on IEMOCAP. We conclude with an error analysis on the generated acoustic reasoning outputs from the omni-LLMs.</description>

      <title>OpenHuEval: Evaluating Large Language Model on Hungarian Specifics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce OpenHuEval, the first benchmark for LLMs focusing on the Hungarian language and specifics. OpenHuEval is constructed from a vast collection of Hungarian-specific materials sourced from multiple origins. In the construction, we incorporated the latest design principles for evaluating LLMs, such as using real user queries from the internet, emphasizing the assessment of LLMs' generative capabilities, and employing LLM-as-judge to enhance the multidimensionality and accuracy of evaluations. Ultimately, OpenHuEval encompasses eight Hungarian-specific dimensions, featuring five tasks and 3953 questions. Consequently, OpenHuEval provides the comprehensive, in-depth, and scientifically accurate assessment of LLM performance in the context of the Hungarian language and its specifics. We evaluated current mainstream LLMs, including both traditional LLMs and recently developed Large Reasoning Models. The results demonstrate the significant necessity for evaluation and model optimization tailored to the Hungarian language and specifics. We also established the framework for analyzing the thinking processes of LRMs with OpenHuEval, revealing intrinsic patterns and mechanisms of these models in non-English languages, with Hungarian serving as a representative example. We will release OpenHuEval at https://github.com/opendatalab/OpenHuEval .</description>

      <title>Keyword-Oriented Multimodal Modeling for Euphemism Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euphemism identification deciphers the true meaning of euphemisms, such as linking "weed" (euphemism) to "marijuana" (target keyword) in illicit texts, aiding content moderation and combating underground markets. While existing methods are primarily text-based, the rise of social media highlights the need for multimodal analysis, incorporating text, images, and audio. However, the lack of multimodal datasets for euphemisms limits further research. To address this, we regard euphemisms and their corresponding target keywords as keywords and first introduce a keyword-oriented multimodal corpus of euphemisms (KOM-Euph), involving three datasets (Drug, Weapon, and Sexuality), including text, images, and speech. We further propose a keyword-oriented multimodal euphemism identification method (KOM-EI), which uses cross-modal feature alignment and dynamic fusion modules to explicitly utilize the visual and audio features of the keywords for efficient euphemism identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KOM-EI outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language models, and show the importance of our multimodal datasets.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Vision-Language Model (VLM) on autonomous driving (AD) primarily assess interpretability through open-form visual question answering (QA) within coarse-grained tasks, which remain insufficient to assess capabilities in complex driving scenarios. To this end, we introduce $\textbf{VLADBench}$, a challenging and fine-grained dataset featuring close-form QAs that progress from static foundational knowledge and elements to advanced reasoning for dynamic on-road situations. The elaborate $\textbf{VLADBench}$ spans 5 key domains: Traffic Knowledge Understanding, General Element Recognition, Traffic Graph Generation, Target Attribute Comprehension, and Ego Decision-Making and Planning. These domains are further broken down into 11 secondary aspects and 29 tertiary tasks for a granular evaluation. A thorough assessment of general and domain-specific (DS) VLMs on this benchmark reveals both their strengths and critical limitations in AD contexts. To further exploit the cognitive and reasoning interactions among the 5 domains for AD understanding, we start from a small-scale VLM and train the DS models on individual domain datasets (collected from 1.4M DS QAs across public sources). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark provides a crucial step toward a more comprehensive assessment of VLMs in AD, paving the way for the development of more cognitively sophisticated and reasoning-capable AD systems.</description>

Abstract: Depression is the most common mental health disorder, and its prevalence increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. As one of the most extensively researched psychological conditions, recent research has increasingly focused on leveraging social media data to enhance traditional methods of depression screening. This paper addresses the growing interest in interdisciplinary research on depression, and aims to support early-career researchers by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date list of datasets for analyzing and predicting depression through social media data. We present an overview of datasets published between 2019 and 2024. We also make the comprehensive list of datasets available online as a continuously updated resource, with the hope that it will facilitate further interdisciplinary research into the linguistic expressions of depression on social media.</description>

Abstract: As the Information Retrieval (IR) field increasingly recognizes the importance of inclusivity, addressing the needs of low-resource languages remains a significant challenge. Transliteration between Urdu and its Romanized form, Roman Urdu, remains underexplored despite the widespread use of both scripts in South Asia. Prior work using RNNs on the Roman-Urdu-Parl dataset showed promising results but suffered from poor domain adaptability and limited evaluation. We propose a transformer-based approach using the m2m100 multilingual translation model, enhanced with masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and fine-tuning on both Roman-Urdu-Parl and the domain-diverse Dakshina dataset. To address previous evaluation flaws, we introduce rigorous dataset splits and assess performance using BLEU, character-level BLEU, and CHRF. Our model achieves strong transliteration performance, with Char-BLEU scores of 96.37 for Urdu-&gt;Roman-Urdu and 97.44 for Roman-Urdu-&gt;Urdu. These results outperform both RNN baselines and GPT-4o Mini and demonstrate the effectiveness of multilingual transfer learning for low-resource transliteration tasks.</description>

      <title>SWI: Speaking with Intent in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for reasoning and problem-solving. This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e., generation without explicit intent). Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger prompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive performance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning). Additionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on reasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks, where SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation. In text summarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness, and factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations. Furthermore, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. This proof-of-concept study creates a novel avenue for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating book summaries from internal knowledge in Large Language Models: a cross-model and semantic consistency approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate comprehensive and accurate book summaries solely from their internal knowledge, without recourse to the original text. Employing a diverse set of books and multiple LLM architectures, we examine whether these models can synthesize meaningful narratives that align with established human interpretations. Evaluation is performed with a LLM-as-a-judge paradigm: each AI-generated summary is compared against a high-quality, human-written summary via a cross-model assessment, where all participating LLMs evaluate not only their own outputs but also those produced by others. This methodology enables the identification of potential biases, such as the proclivity for models to favor their own summarization style over others. In addition, alignment between the human-crafted and LLM-generated summaries is quantified using ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, assessing the depth of grammatical and semantic correspondence. The results reveal nuanced variations in content representation and stylistic preferences among the models, highlighting both strengths and limitations inherent in relying on internal knowledge for summarization tasks. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of LLM internal encodings of factual information and the dynamics of cross-model evaluation, with implications for the development of more robust natural language generative systems.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Models: Language, Multimodality, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1, have demonstrated strong performance gains by scaling up the length of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning during inference. However, a growing concern lies in their tendency to produce excessively long reasoning traces, which are often filled with redundant content (e.g., repeated definitions), over-analysis of simple problems, and superficial exploration of multiple reasoning paths for harder tasks. This inefficiency introduces significant challenges for training, inference, and real-world deployment (e.g., in agent-based systems), where token economy is critical. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent efforts aimed at improving reasoning efficiency in LRMs, with a particular focus on the unique challenges that arise in this new paradigm. We identify common patterns of inefficiency, examine methods proposed across the LRM lifecycle, i.e., from pretraining to inference, and discuss promising future directions for research. To support ongoing development, we also maintain a real-time GitHub repository tracking recent progress in the field. We hope this survey serves as a foundation for further exploration and inspires innovation in this rapidly evolving area.</description>

      <title>COMI-LINGUA: Expert Annotated Large-Scale Dataset for Multitask NLP in Hindi-English Code-Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of digital communication has driven the widespread use of code-mixing, particularly Hindi-English, in multilingual communities. Existing datasets often focus on romanized text, have limited scope, or rely on synthetic data, which fails to capture realworld language nuances. Human annotations are crucial for assessing the naturalness and acceptability of code-mixed text. To address these challenges, We introduce COMI-LINGUA, the largest manually annotated dataset for code-mixed text, comprising 100,970 instances evaluated by three expert annotators in both Devanagari and Roman scripts. The dataset supports five fundamental NLP tasks: Language Identification, Matrix Language Identification, Part-of-Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, and Translation. We evaluate LLMs on these tasks using COMILINGUA, revealing limitations in current multilingual modeling strategies and emphasizing the need for improved code-mixed text processing capabilities. COMI-LINGUA is publically availabe at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LingoIITGN/COMI-LINGUA.</description>

      <title>How do language models learn facts? Dynamics, curricula and hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models accumulate vast knowledge during pre-training, yet the dynamics governing this acquisition remain poorly understood. This work investigates the learning dynamics of language models on a synthetic factual recall task, uncovering three key findings: First, language models learn in three phases, exhibiting a performance plateau before acquiring precise factual knowledge. Mechanistically, this plateau coincides with the formation of attention-based circuits that support recall. Second, the training data distribution significantly impacts learning dynamics, as imbalanced distributions lead to shorter plateaus. Finally, hallucinations emerge simultaneously with knowledge, and integrating new knowledge into the model through fine-tuning is challenging, as it quickly corrupts its existing parametric memories. Our results emphasize the importance of data distribution in knowledge acquisition and suggest novel data scheduling strategies to accelerate neural network training.</description>

      <title>JiraiBench: A Bilingual Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models' Detection of Human Self-Destructive Behavior Content in Jirai Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces JiraiBench, the first bilingual benchmark for evaluating large language models' effectiveness in detecting self-destructive content across Chinese and Japanese social media communities. Focusing on the transnational "Jirai" (landmine) online subculture that encompasses multiple forms of self-destructive behaviors including drug overdose, eating disorders, and self-harm, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework incorporating both linguistic and cultural dimensions. Our dataset comprises 10,419 Chinese posts and 5,000 Japanese posts with multidimensional annotation along three behavioral categories, achieving substantial inter-annotator agreement. Experimental evaluations across four state-of-the-art models reveal significant performance variations based on instructional language, with Japanese prompts unexpectedly outperforming Chinese prompts when processing Chinese content. This emergent cross-cultural transfer suggests that cultural proximity can sometimes outweigh linguistic similarity in detection tasks. Cross-lingual transfer experiments with fine-tuned models further demonstrate the potential for knowledge transfer between these language systems without explicit target language training. These findings highlight the need for culturally-informed approaches to multilingual content moderation and provide empirical evidence for the importance of cultural context in developing more effective detection systems for vulnerable online communities.</description>

      <title>Embodied-Reasoner: Synergizing Visual Search, Reasoning, and Action for Embodied Interactive Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep thinking models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their effectiveness in embodied domains which require continuous interaction with environments through image action interleaved trajectories remains largely -unexplored. We present Embodied Reasoner, a model that extends o1 style reasoning to interactive embodied search tasks. Unlike mathematical reasoning that relies primarily on logical deduction, embodied scenarios demand spatial understanding, temporal reasoning, and ongoing self-reflection based on interaction history. To address these challenges, we synthesize 9.3k coherent Observation-Thought-Action trajectories containing 64k interactive images and 90k diverse thinking processes (analysis, spatial reasoning, reflection, planning, and verification). We develop a three-stage training pipeline that progressively enhances the model's capabilities through imitation learning, self-exploration via rejection sampling, and self-correction through reflection tuning. The evaluation shows that our model significantly outperforms those advanced visual reasoning models, e.g., it exceeds OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Claude-3.7 by +9\%, 24\%, and +13\%. Analysis reveals our model exhibits fewer repeated searches and logical inconsistencies, with particular advantages in complex long-horizon tasks. Real-world environments also show our superiority while exhibiting fewer repeated searches and logical inconsistency cases.</description>

      <title>As easy as PIE: understanding when pruning causes language models to disagree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language Model (LM) pruning compresses the model by removing weights, nodes, or other parts of its architecture. Typically, pruning focuses on the resulting efficiency gains at the cost of effectiveness. However, when looking at how individual data points are affected by pruning, it turns out that a particular subset of data points always bears most of the brunt (in terms of reduced accuracy) when pruning, but this effect goes unnoticed when reporting the mean accuracy of all data points. These data points are called PIEs and have been studied in image processing, but not in NLP. In a study of various NLP datasets, pruning methods, and levels of compression, we find that PIEs impact inference quality considerably, regardless of class frequency, and that BERT is more prone to this than BiLSTM. We also find that PIEs contain a high amount of data points that have the largest influence on how well the model generalises to unseen data. This means that when pruning, with seemingly moderate loss to accuracy across all data points, we in fact hurt tremendously those data points that matter the most. We trace what makes PIEs both hard and impactful to inference to their overall longer and more semantically complex text. These findings are novel and contribute to understanding how LMs are affected by pruning. The code is available at: https://github.com/pietrotrope/AsEasyAsPIE</description>

      <title>CLAIMCHECK: How Grounded are LLM Critiques of Scientific Papers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core part of scientific peer review involves providing expert critiques that directly assess the scientific claims a paper makes. While it is now possible to automatically generate plausible (if generic) reviews, ensuring that these reviews are sound and grounded in the papers' claims remains challenging. To facilitate LLM benchmarking on these challenges, we introduce CLAIMCHECK, an annotated dataset of NeurIPS 2023 and 2024 submissions and reviews mined from OpenReview. CLAIMCHECK is richly annotated by ML experts for weakness statements in the reviews and the paper claims that they dispute, as well as fine-grained labels of the validity, objectivity, and type of the identified weaknesses. We benchmark several LLMs on three claim-centric tasks supported by CLAIMCHECK, requiring models to (1) associate weaknesses with the claims they dispute, (2) predict fine-grained labels for weaknesses and rewrite the weaknesses to enhance their specificity, and (3) verify a paper's claims with grounded reasoning. Our experiments reveal that cutting-edge LLMs, while capable of predicting weakness labels in (2), continue to underperform relative to human experts on all other tasks.</description>

      <title>Outlier dimensions favor frequent tokens in language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study last-layer outlier dimensions, i.e.dimensions that display extreme activations for the majority of inputs. We show that outlier dimensions arise in many different modern language models, and trace their function back to the heuristic of constantly predicting frequent words. We further show how a model can block this heuristic when it is not contextually appropriate, by assigning a counterbalancing weight mass to the remaining dimensions, and we investigate which model parameters boost outlier dimensions and when they arise during training. We conclude that outlier dimensions are a specialized mechanism discovered by many distinct models to implement a useful token prediction heuristic.</description>

      <title>Collab: Controlled Decoding using Mixture of Agents for LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment of Large Language models (LLMs) is crucial for safe and trustworthy deployment in applications. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences and broader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters, which is computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a mechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However, single-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due to the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the test-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of agent-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned LLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture of agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for inference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among multiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen from a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This policy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step, enabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding. Theoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance with respect to the target task represented via a target reward for the given off-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with open-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates the merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines. Notably, Collab surpasses the current SoTA decoding strategy, achieving an improvement of up to 1.56x in average reward and 71.89% in GPT-4 based win-tie rate.</description>

      <title>ReaRAG: Knowledge-guided Reasoning Enhances Factuality of Large Reasoning Models with Iterative Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities but rely primarily on parametric knowledge, limiting factual accuracy. While recent works equip reinforcement learning (RL)-based LRMs with retrieval capabilities, they suffer from overthinking and lack robustness in reasoning, reducing their effectiveness in question answering (QA) tasks. To address this, we propose ReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that explores diverse queries without excessive iterations. Our solution includes a novel data construction framework with an upper bound on the reasoning chain length. Specifically, we first leverage an LRM to generate deliberate thinking, then select an action from a predefined action space (Search and Finish). For Search action, a query is executed against the RAG engine, where the result is returned as observation to guide reasoning steps later. This process iterates until a Finish action is chosen. Benefiting from ReaRAG's strong reasoning capabilities, our approach outperforms existing baselines on multi-hop QA. Further analysis highlights its strong reflective ability to recognize errors and refine its reasoning trajectory. Our study enhances LRMs' factuality while effectively integrating robust reasoning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).</description>

      <title>Effective Skill Unlearning through Intervention and Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable skills across various domains. Understanding the mechanisms behind their abilities and implementing controls over them is becoming increasingly important for developing better models. In this paper, we focus on skill unlearning in LLMs, specifically unlearning a particular skill while retaining their overall capabilities. We introduce two lightweight, training-free machine skill unlearning techniques for LLMs. First, we observe that the pre-activation distribution of neurons in each Feed-Forward Layer (FFL) differs when the model demonstrates different skills. Additionally, we find that queries triggering the same skill cluster within the FFL key space and can be separated from other queries using a hypercube. Based on these observations, we propose two lightweight, training-free skill unlearning methods via \textit{intervention} and \textit{abstention} respectively: \texttt{Neuron Adjust} and \texttt{Key Space Detection}. We evaluate our methods on unlearning math-solving, Python-coding, and comprehension skills across seven different languages. The results demonstrate their strong unlearning capabilities for the designated skills. Specifically, \texttt{Key Space Detection} achieves over 80\% relative performance drop on the forgetting skill and less than 10\% relative performance drop on other skills and the model's general knowledge (MMLU) for most unlearning tasks.

      <title>MemInsight: Autonomous Memory Augmentation for LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have evolved to intelligently process information, make decisions, and interact with users or tools. A key capability is the integration of long-term memory capabilities, enabling these agents to draw upon historical interactions and knowledge. However, the growing memory size and need for semantic structuring pose significant challenges. In this work, we propose an autonomous memory augmentation approach, MemInsight, to enhance semantic data representation and retrieval mechanisms. By leveraging autonomous augmentation to historical interactions, LLM agents are shown to deliver more accurate and contextualized responses. We empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in three task scenarios; conversational recommendation, question answering and event summarization. On the LLM-REDIAL dataset, MemInsight boosts persuasiveness of recommendations by up to 14%. Moreover, it outperforms a RAG baseline by 34% in recall for LoCoMo retrieval. Our empirical results show the potential of MemInsight to enhance the contextual performance of LLM agents across multiple tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent advance in speech technology, smart voice assistants have been improved and are now used by many people. But often these assistants are running online as a cloud service and are not always known for a good protection of users' privacy. This paper presents the architecture of a novel voice assistant, called Jaco, with the following features: (a) It can run completely offline, even on low resource devices like a RaspberryPi. (b) Through a skill concept it can be easily extended. (c) The architectural focus is on protecting users' privacy, but without restricting capabilities for developers. (d) It supports multiple languages. (e) It is competitive with other voice assistant solutions. In this respect the assistant combines and extends the advantages of other approaches.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Safety-Capability Trade-offs in Fine-tuning Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on some task-specific datasets has been a primary use of LLMs. However, it has been empirically observed that this approach to enhancing capability inevitably compromises safety, a phenomenon also known as the safety-capability trade-off in LLM fine-tuning. This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding the interplay between safety and capability in two primary safety-aware LLM fine-tuning strategies, providing new insights into the effects of data similarity, context overlap, and alignment loss landscape. Our theoretical results characterize the fundamental limits of the safety-capability trade-off in LLM fine-tuning, which are also validated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Generating Synthetic Data with Formal Privacy Guarantees: State of the Art and the Road Ahead</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving synthetic data offers a promising solution to harness segregated data in high-stakes domains where information is compartmentalized for regulatory, privacy, or institutional reasons. This survey provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the landscape of privacy-preserving synthetic data, presenting the theoretical foundations of generative models and differential privacy followed by a review of state-of-the-art methods across tabular data, images, and text. Our synthesis of evaluation approaches highlights the fundamental trade-off between utility for down-stream tasks and privacy guarantees, while identifying critical research gaps: the lack of realistic benchmarks representing specialized domains and insufficient empirical evaluations required to contextualise formal guarantees.
  Through empirical analysis of four leading methods on five real-world datasets from specialized domains, we demonstrate significant performance degradation under realistic privacy constraints ($\epsilon \leq 4$), revealing a substantial gap between results reported on general domain benchmarks and performance on domain-specific data. %Our findings highlight key challenges including unaccounted privacy leakage, insufficient empirical verification of formal guarantees, and a critical deficit of realistic benchmarks. These challenges underscore the need for robust evaluation frameworks, standardized benchmarks for specialized domains, and improved techniques to address the unique requirements of privacy-sensitive fields such that this technology can deliver on its considerable potential.</description>

      <title>VinaBench: Benchmark for Faithful and Consistent Visual Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual narrative generation transforms textual narratives into sequences of images illustrating the content of the text. However, generating visual narratives that are faithful to the input text and self-consistent across generated images remains an open challenge, due to the lack of knowledge constraints used for planning the stories. In this work, we propose a new benchmark, VinaBench, to address this challenge. Our benchmark annotates the underlying commonsense and discourse constraints in visual narrative samples, offering systematic scaffolds for learning the implicit strategies of visual storytelling. Based on the incorporated narrative constraints, we further propose novel metrics to closely evaluate the consistency of generated narrative images and the alignment of generations with the input textual narrative. Our results across three generative vision models demonstrate that learning with VinaBench's knowledge constraints effectively improves the faithfulness and cohesion of generated visual narratives.</description>

      <title>ReverBERT: A State Space Model for Efficient Text-Driven Speech Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-driven speech style transfer aims to mold the intonation, pace, and timbre of a spoken utterance to match stylistic cues from text descriptions. While existing methods leverage large-scale neural architectures or pre-trained language models, the computational costs often remain high. In this paper, we present \emph{ReverBERT}, an efficient framework for text-driven speech style transfer that draws inspiration from a state space model (SSM) paradigm, loosely motivated by the image-based method of Wang and Liu~\cite{wang2024stylemamba}. Unlike image domain techniques, our method operates in the speech space and integrates a discrete Fourier transform of latent speech features to enable smooth and continuous style modulation. We also propose a novel \emph{Transformer-based SSM} layer for bridging textual style descriptors with acoustic attributes, dramatically reducing inference time while preserving high-quality speech characteristics. Extensive experiments on benchmark speech corpora demonstrate that \emph{ReverBERT} significantly outperforms baselines in terms of naturalness, expressiveness, and computational efficiency. We release our model and code publicly to foster further research in text-driven speech style transfer.</description>

      <title>Rerouting Connection: Hybrid Computer Vision Analysis Reveals Visual Similarity Between Indus and Tibetan-Yi Corridor Writing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis employs a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, in conjunction with a detailed anthropological framework, to investigate potential historical connections between the visual morphology of the Indus Valley script and pictographic systems of the Tibetan-Yi Corridor. Through an ensemble methodology of three target scripts across 15 independently trained models, we demonstrate that Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts exhibit approximately six-fold higher visual similarity to the Indus script (61.7%-63.5%) than to the Bronze Age Proto-Cuneiform (10.2%-10.9%) or Proto-Elamite (7.6%-8.7%) systems. Additionally and contrarily to our current understanding of the networks of the Indus Valley Civilization, the Indus script unexpectedly maps closer to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts, with a mean cosine similarity of 0.629, than to the aforementioned contemporaneous West Asian signaries, both of which recorded mean cosine similarities of 0.104 and 0.080 despite their close geographic proximity and evident trade relations. Across various dimensionality reduction practices and clustering methodologies, the Indus script consistently clusters closest to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts. Our computational results align with qualitative observations of specific pictorial parallels in numeral systems, gender markers, and key iconographic elements; this is further supported by archaeological evidence of sustained contact networks along the ancient Shu-Shendu road in tandem with the Indus Valley Civilization's decline, providing a plausible transmission pathway. While alternative explanations cannot be ruled out, the specificity and consistency of observed similarities challenge conventional narratives of isolated script development and suggest more complex ancient cultural transmission networks between South and East Asia than previously recognized.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Analyzing Subjective Uncertainty in Scientific Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty of scientific findings are typically reported through statistical metrics such as $p$-values, confidence intervals, etc. The magnitude of this objective uncertainty is reflected in the language used by the authors to report their findings primarily through expressions carrying uncertainty-inducing terms or phrases. This language uncertainty is a subjective concept and is highly dependent on the writing style of the authors. There is evidence that such subjective uncertainty influences the impact of science on public audience. In this work, we turned our focus to scientists themselves, and measured/analyzed the subjective uncertainty and its impact within scientific communities across different disciplines. We showed that the level of this type of uncertainty varies significantly across different fields, years of publication and geographical locations. We also studied the correlation between subjective uncertainty and several bibliographical metrics, such as number/gender of authors, centrality of the field's community, citation count, etc. The underlying patterns identified in this work are useful in identification and documentation of linguistic norms in scientific communication in different communities/societies.</description>

      <title>VoxRep: Enhancing 3D Spatial Understanding in 2D Vision-Language Models via Voxel Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comprehending 3D environments is vital for intelligent systems in domains like robotics and autonomous navigation. Voxel grids offer a structured representation of 3D space, but extracting high-level semantic meaning remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel approach utilizing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract "voxel semantics"-object identity, color, and location-from voxel data. Critically, instead of employing complex 3D networks, our method processes the voxel space by systematically slicing it along a primary axis (e.g., the Z-axis, analogous to CT scan slices). These 2D slices are then formatted and sequentially fed into the image encoder of a standard VLM. The model learns to aggregate information across slices and correlate spatial patterns with semantic concepts provided by the language component. This slice-based strategy aims to leverage the power of pre-trained 2D VLMs for efficient 3D semantic understanding directly from voxel representations.</description>

      <title>Bias-Aware Agent: Enhancing Fairness in AI-Driven Knowledge Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in retrieving accessible information have evolved faster in the last few years compared to the decades since the internet's creation. Search engines, like Google, have been the number one way to find relevant data. They have always relied on the user's abilities to find the best information in its billions of links and sources at everybody's fingertips. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has completely transformed the field of information retrieval. The LLMs excel not only at retrieving relevant knowledge but also at summarizing it effectively, making information more accessible and consumable for users. On top of it, the rise of AI Agents has introduced another aspect to information retrieval i.e. dynamic information retrieval which enables the integration of real-time data such as weather forecasts, and financial data with the knowledge base to curate context-aware knowledge. However, despite these advancements the agents remain susceptible to issues of bias and fairness, challenges deeply rooted within the knowledge base and training of LLMs. This study introduces a novel approach to bias-aware knowledge retrieval by leveraging agentic framework and the innovative use of bias detectors as tools to identify and highlight inherent biases in the retrieved content. By empowering users with transparency and awareness, this approach aims to foster more equitable information systems and promote the development of responsible AI.</description>

      <title>Composable Prompting Workspaces for Creative Writing: Exploration and Iteration Using Dynamic Widgets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI models offer many possibilities for text creation and transformation. Current graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for prompting them lack support for iterative exploration, as they do not represent prompts as actionable interface objects. We propose the concept of a composable prompting canvas for text exploration and iteration using dynamic widgets. Users generate widgets through system suggestions, prompting, or manually to capture task-relevant facets that affect the generated text. In a comparative study with a baseline (conversational UI), 18 participants worked on two writing tasks, creating diverse prompting environments with custom widgets and spatial layouts. They reported having more control over the generated text and preferred our system over the baseline. Our design significantly outperformed the baseline on the Creativity Support Index, and participants felt the results were worth the effort. This work highlights the need for GUIs that support user-driven customization and (re-)structuring to increase both the flexibility and efficiency of prompting.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for coding tasks, yet in most scenarios it is assumed that all relevant information can be either accessed in context or matches their training data. We posit that LLMs can benefit from the ability to interactively explore a codebase to gather the information relevant to their task. To achieve this, we present a textual environment, namely debug-gym, for developing LLM-based agents in an interactive coding setting. Our environment is lightweight and provides a preset of useful tools, such as a Python debugger (pdb), designed to facilitate an LLM-based agent's interactive debugging. Beyond coding and debugging tasks, this approach can be generalized to other tasks that would benefit from information-seeking behavior by an LLM agent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging acquires general capabilities without extra data or training by combining multiple models' parameters. Previous approaches achieve linear mode connectivity by aligning parameters into the same loss basin using permutation invariance. In this paper, we introduce Model Assembly Learning (MAL), a novel paradigm for model merging that iteratively integrates parameters from diverse models in an open-ended model zoo to enhance the base model's capabilities. Unlike previous works that require identical architectures, MAL allows the merging of heterogeneous architectures and selective parameters across layers. Specifically, the base model can incorporate parameters from different layers of multiple pre-trained models. We systematically investigate the conditions and fundamental settings of heterogeneous parameter merging, addressing all possible mismatches in layer widths between the base and target models. Furthermore, we establish key laws and provide practical guidelines for effectively implementing MAL.</description>

      <title>LLM-Gomoku: A Large Language Model-Based System for Strategic Gomoku with Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP), with strong capa-bilities in generation, comprehension, and rea-soning. These models have found applications in education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively utilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on LLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is de-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational decisions. The research methods include enabling the model to "read the board," "understand the rules," "select strategies," and "evaluate positions," while en-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of move positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces pro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play training, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.</description>

      <title>Learning to Represent Individual Differences for Choice Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human decision making can be challenging to predict because decisions are affected by a number of complex factors. Adding to this complexity, decision-making processes can differ considerably between individuals, and methods aimed at predicting human decisions need to take individual differences into account. Behavioral science offers methods by which to measure individual differences (e.g., questionnaires, behavioral models), but these are often narrowed down to low dimensions and not tailored to specific prediction tasks. This paper investigates the use of representation learning to measure individual differences from behavioral experiment data. Representation learning offers a flexible approach to create individual embeddings from data that are both structured (e.g., demographic information) and unstructured (e.g., free text), where the flexibility provides more options for individual difference measures for personalization, e.g., free text responses may allow for open-ended questions that are less privacy-sensitive. In the current paper we use representation learning to characterize individual differences in human performance on an economic decision-making task. We demonstrate that models using representation learning to capture individual differences consistently improve decision predictions over models without representation learning, and even outperform well-known theory-based behavioral models used in these environments. Our results propose that representation learning offers a useful and flexible tool to capture individual differences.</description>

      <title>Elementwise Layer Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent paper proposed Dynamic Tanh (DyT) as a drop-in replacement for Layer Normalization. Although the method is empirically well-motivated and appealing from a practical point of view, it lacks a theoretical foundation. In this work, we derive DyT mathematically and show that a well-defined approximation is needed to do so. By dropping said approximation, an alternative element-wise transformation is obtained, which we call Elementwise Layer Normalization (ELN). We demonstrate that ELN resembles Layer Normalization more accurately than DyT does.</description>

      <title>GateLens: A Reasoning-Enhanced LLM Agent for Automotive Software Release Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems. Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process. However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted. Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</description>

      <title>StyleMotif: Multi-Modal Motion Stylization using Style-Content Cross Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present StyleMotif, a novel Stylized Motion Latent Diffusion model, generating motion conditioned on both content and style from multiple modalities. Unlike existing approaches that either focus on generating diverse motion content or transferring style from sequences, StyleMotif seamlessly synthesizes motion across a wide range of content while incorporating stylistic cues from multi-modal inputs, including motion, text, image, video, and audio. To achieve this, we introduce a style-content cross fusion mechanism and align a style encoder with a pre-trained multi-modal model, ensuring that the generated motion accurately captures the reference style while preserving realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework surpasses existing methods in stylized motion generation and exhibits emergent capabilities for multi-modal motion stylization, enabling more nuanced motion synthesis. Source code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance. Project Page: https://stylemotif.github.io</description>

      <title>Edited Media Understanding Frames: Reasoning About the Intent and Implications of Visual Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.04726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal disinformation, from 'deepfakes' to simple edits that deceive, is an important societal problem. Yet at the same time, the vast majority of media edits are harmless -- such as a filtered vacation photo. The difference between this example, and harmful edits that spread disinformation, is one of intent. Recognizing and describing this intent is a major challenge for today's AI systems.
  We present the task of Edited Media Understanding, requiring models to answer open-ended questions that capture the intent and implications of an image edit. We introduce a dataset for our task, EMU, with 48k question-answer pairs written in rich natural language. We evaluate a wide variety of vision-and-language models for our task, and introduce a new model PELICAN, which builds upon recent progress in pretrained multimodal representations. Our model obtains promising results on our dataset, with humans rating its answers as accurate 40.35% of the time. At the same time, there is still much work to be done -- humans prefer human-annotated captions 93.56% of the time -- and we provide analysis that highlights areas for further progress.</description>

      <title>Achieving &gt;97% on GSM8K: Deeply Understanding the Problems Makes LLMs Better Solvers for Math Word Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14963v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has enhanced the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various reasoning tasks. However, CoT still falls short in dealing with complex math word problems, as it usually suffers from three pitfalls: semantic misunderstanding errors, calculation errors, and step-missing errors. Prior studies involve addressing the calculation errors and step-missing errors, but neglect the semantic misunderstanding errors, which is the major factor limiting the reasoning performance of LLMs. To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, namely Deeply Understanding the Problems (DUP), to improve the LLMs' math problem-solving ability by addressing semantic misunderstanding errors. The core of our method is to encourage the LLMs to deeply understand the problems and extract the key problem-solving information used for better reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 diverse reasoning benchmarks show that our DUP method consistently outperforms the other counterparts by a large margin. More encouragingly, DUP achieves a new SOTA result on the GSM8K benchmark, with an accuracy of 97.1% under the zero-shot setting.</description>

      <title>A Context-Aware Approach for Enhancing Data Imputation with Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach named \textbf{C}ontextually \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{I}mputation leveraging pre-trained \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odels (\textbf{CRILM}) for handling missing data in tabular datasets. Instead of relying on traditional numerical estimations, CRILM uses pre-trained language models (LMs) to create contextually relevant descriptors for missing values. This method aligns datasets with LMs' strengths, allowing large LMs to generate these descriptors and small LMs to be fine-tuned on the enriched datasets for enhanced downstream task performance. Our evaluations demonstrate CRILM's superior performance and robustness across MCAR, MAR, and challenging MNAR scenarios, with up to a 10\% improvement over the best-performing baselines. By mitigating biases, particularly in MNAR settings, CRILM improves downstream task performance and offers a cost-effective solution for resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in language understanding and generation. Building on the success of text-based LLMs, recent research has adapted these models to use speech embeddings for prompting, resulting in Speech-LLM models that exhibit strong performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speech translation (AST). In this work, we propose a novel approach to leverage ASR transcripts as prompts for AST in a Speech-LLM built on an encoder-decoder text LLM. The Speech-LLM model consists of a speech encoder and an encoder-decoder structure Megatron-T5. By first decoding speech to generate ASR transcripts and subsequently using these transcripts along with encoded speech for prompting, we guide the speech translation in a two-step process like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is used for the T5 LLM for model adaptation and shows superior performance to full model fine-tuning. Experimental results show that the proposed CoT prompting significantly improves AST performance, achieving an average increase of 2.4 BLEU points across 6 En-&gt;X or X-&gt;En AST tasks compared to speech prompting alone. Additionally, compared to a related CoT prediction method that predicts a concatenated sequence of ASR and AST transcripts, our method performs better by an average of 2 BLEU points.</description>

      <title>OmniBench: Towards The Future of Universal Omni-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have focused on integrating multiple modalities, yet their ability to simultaneously process and reason across different inputs remains underexplored. We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define language models capable of such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench features high-quality human annotations that require integrated understanding across all modalities. Our evaluation reveals that: i) open-source OLMs show significant limitations in instruction-following and reasoning in tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baseline models perform poorly (around 50% accuracy) even with textual alternatives to image/audio inputs. To address these limitations, we develop OmniInstruct, an 96K-sample instruction tuning dataset for training OLMs. We advocate for developing more robust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM performance. Codes and data could be found at our repo (https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/OmniBench).</description>

      <title>Does RAG Introduce Unfairness in LLMs? Evaluating Fairness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently gained significant attention for its enhanced ability to integrate external knowledge sources into open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. However, it remains unclear how these models address fairness concerns, particularly with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, geographic location, and other demographic factors. First, as language models evolve to prioritize utility, like improving exact match accuracy, fairness considerations may have been largely overlooked. Second, the complex, multi-component architecture of RAG methods poses challenges in identifying and mitigating biases, as each component is optimized for distinct objectives. In this paper, we aim to empirically evaluate fairness in several RAG methods. We propose a fairness evaluation framework tailored to RAG, using scenario-based questions and analyzing disparities across demographic attributes. Our experimental results indicate that, despite recent advances in utility-driven optimization, fairness issues persist in both the retrieval and generation stages. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address fairness concerns throughout the RAG pipeline. The dataset and code used in this study are publicly available at this GitHub Repository https://github.com/elviswxy/RAG_fairness .</description>

      <title>Towards Controllable Speech Synthesis in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS), also known as speech synthesis, is a prominent research area that aims to generate natural-sounding human speech from text. Recently, with the increasing industrial demand, TTS technologies have evolved beyond synthesizing human-like speech to enabling controllable speech generation. This includes fine-grained control over various attributes of synthesized speech such as emotion, prosody, timbre, and duration. In addition, advancements in deep learning, such as diffusion and large language models, have significantly enhanced controllable TTS over the past several years. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive survey of controllable TTS, covering approaches ranging from basic control techniques to methods utilizing natural language prompts, aiming to provide a clear understanding of the current state of research. We examine the general controllable TTS pipeline, challenges, model architectures, and control strategies, offering a comprehensive and clear taxonomy of existing methods. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of datasets and evaluation metrics and shed some light on the applications and future directions of controllable TTS. To the best of our knowledge, this survey paper provides the first comprehensive review of emerging controllable TTS methods, which can serve as a beneficial resource for both academic researchers and industrial practitioners.</description>

      <title>Modeling Story Expectations to Understand Engagement: A Generative Framework Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding when and why consumers engage with stories is crucial for content creators and platforms. While existing theories suggest that audience beliefs of what is going to happen should play an important role in engagement decisions, empirical work has mostly focused on developing techniques to directly extract features from actual content, rather than capturing forward-looking beliefs, due to the lack of a principled way to model such beliefs in unstructured narrative data. To complement existing feature extraction techniques, this paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models to model audience forward-looking beliefs about how stories might unfold. Our method generates multiple potential continuations for each story and extracts features related to expectations, uncertainty, and surprise using established content analysis techniques. Applying our method to over 30,000 book chapters, we demonstrate that our framework complements existing feature engineering techniques by amplifying their marginal explanatory power on average by 31%. The results reveal that different types of engagement-continuing to read, commenting, and voting-are driven by distinct combinations of current and anticipated content features. Our framework provides a novel way to study and explore how audience forward-looking beliefs shape their engagement with narrative media, with implications for marketing strategy in content-focused industries.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful guidance to those working on human AI alignment.</description>

      <title>Hengqin-RA-v1: Advanced Large Language Model for Diagnosis and Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis with Dataset based Traditional Chinese Medicine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) primarily trained on English texts, often face biases and inaccuracies in Chinese contexts. Their limitations are pronounced in fields like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), where cultural and clinical subtleties are vital, further hindered by a lack of domain-specific data, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To address these issues, this paper introduces Hengqin-RA-v1, the first large language model specifically tailored for TCM with a focus on diagnosing and treating RA. We also present HQ-GCM-RA-C1, a comprehensive RA-specific dataset curated from ancient Chinese medical literature, classical texts, and modern clinical studies. This dataset empowers Hengqin-RA-v1 to deliver accurate and culturally informed responses, effectively bridging the gaps left by general-purpose models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hengqin-RA-v1 outperforms state-of-the-art models, even surpassing the diagnostic accuracy of TCM practitioners in certain cases.</description>

      <title>iTool: Boosting Tool Use of Large Language Models via Iterative Reinforced Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is known as a promising approach to enhancing their capabilities, especially for complex tasks. Synthesizing tool-use data through real-world simulations is an effective way to achieve it. Nevertheless, our investigation reveals that (1) training gains significantly decay as synthetic data increases. The model struggles to benefit from more synthetic data due to potential data diversity issues, resulting in poor performance in complex scenarios. Moreover, we find that (2) this challenge primarily manifests as minor discrepancies between the model's output and the ground truth response (termed as deficiency), such as errors in parameter values that require complex reasoning from the context to resolve. To this end, we propose an iterative reinforced fine-tuning strategy designed to alleviate these challenges. This strategy involves: (1) enhancing the diversity of synthetic data through path exploration of Monte Carlo Tree Search. (2) iteratively identifying deficiency-related data, constructing fine-grained preference pairs to pinpoint deficiencies, and then applying preference optimization to optimize these deficiencies. Our experiments show that models trained using our method achieve about 12\% better performance than baseline models, outperforming larger open-source and closed-source models.</description>

      <title>AnyEdit: Edit Any Knowledge Encoded in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated information, necessitating efficient and precise knowledge updates. Current model editing methods, however, struggle with long-form knowledge in diverse formats, such as poetry, code snippets, and mathematical derivations. These limitations arise from their reliance on editing a single token's hidden state, a limitation we term "efficacy barrier". To solve this, we propose AnyEdit, a new autoregressive editing paradigm. It decomposes long-form knowledge into sequential chunks and iteratively edits the key token in each chunk, ensuring consistent and accurate outputs. Theoretically, we ground AnyEdit in the Chain Rule of Mutual Information, showing its ability to update any knowledge within LLMs. Empirically, it outperforms strong baselines by 21.5% on benchmarks including UnKEBench, AKEW, and our new EditEverything dataset for long-form diverse-formatted knowledge. Additionally, AnyEdit serves as a plug-and-play framework, enabling current editing methods to update knowledge with arbitrary length and format, significantly advancing the scope and practicality of LLM knowledge editing.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Lifelong Editing for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire information from pre-training corpora, but their stored knowledge can become inaccurate or outdated over time. Model editing addresses this challenge by modifying model parameters without retraining, and prevalent approaches leverage hypernetworks to generate these parameter updates. However, they face significant challenges in lifelong editing due to their incompatibility with LLM parameters that dynamically change during the editing process. To address this, we observed that hypernetwork-based lifelong editing aligns with reinforcement learning modeling and proposed RLEdit, an RL-based editing method. By treating editing losses as rewards and optimizing hypernetwork parameters at the full knowledge sequence level, we enable it to precisely capture LLM changes and generate appropriate parameter updates. Our extensive empirical evaluation across several LLMs demonstrates that RLEdit outperforms existing methods in lifelong editing with superior effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a 59.24% improvement while requiring only 2.11% of the time compared to most approaches.

      <title>Group Reasoning Emission Estimation Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reporting is critical for governments, businesses, and investors. However, adoption remains limited particularly among small and medium enterprises due to high implementation costs, fragmented emission factor databases, and a lack of robust sector classification methods. To address these challenges, we introduce Group Reasoning Emission Estimation Networks (GREEN), an AI-driven carbon accounting framework that standardizes enterprise-level emission estimation, constructs a large-scale benchmark dataset, and leverages a novel reasoning approach with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we compile textual descriptions for 20,850 companies with validated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) labels and align these with an economic model of carbon intensity factors. By reframing sector classification as an information retrieval task, we fine-tune Sentence-BERT models using a contrastive learning loss. To overcome the limitations of single-stage models in handling thousands of hierarchical categories, we propose a Group Reasoning method that ensembles LLM classifiers based on the natural NAICS ontology, decomposing the task into multiple sub-classification steps. We theoretically prove that this approach reduces classification uncertainty and computational complexity. Experiments on 1,114 NAICS categories yield state-of-the-art performance (83.68% Top-1, 91.47% Top-10 accuracy), and case studies on 20 companies report a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 45.88%. The project is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yvnminc/ExioNAICS.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM Character-Level Manipulation via Divide and Conquer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they exhibit notable weaknesses in character-level string manipulation, struggling with fundamental operations such as character deletion, insertion, and substitution. These challenges stem primarily from tokenization constraints, despite the critical role of such operations in data preprocessing and code generation. Through systematic analysis, we derive two key insights: (1) LLMs face significant difficulties in leveraging intrinsic token knowledge for character-level reasoning, and (2) atomized word structures can substantially enhance LLMs' ability to process token-level structural information. Building on these insights, we propose Character-Level Manipulation via Divide and Conquer, a novel approach designed to bridge the gap between token-level processing and character-level manipulation. Our method decomposes complex operations into explicit character-level subtasks coupled with controlled token reconstruction phases, leading to significant improvements in accuracy. Without additional training, our method significantly improves accuracies on the $\texttt{Deletion}$, $\texttt{Insertion}$, and $\texttt{Substitution}$ tasks. To support further research, we open-source our implementation and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Systematic Knowledge Injection into Large Language Models via Diverse Augmentation for Domain-Specific RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>IHEval: Evaluating Language Models on Following the Instruction Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The instruction hierarchy, which establishes a priority order from system messages to user messages, conversation history, and tool outputs, is essential for ensuring consistent and safe behavior in language models (LMs). Despite its importance, this topic receives limited attention, and there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating models' ability to follow the instruction hierarchy. We bridge this gap by introducing IHEval, a novel benchmark comprising 3,538 examples across nine tasks, covering cases where instructions in different priorities either align or conflict. Our evaluation of popular LMs highlights their struggle to recognize instruction priorities. All evaluated models experience a sharp performance decline when facing conflicting instructions, compared to their original instruction-following performance. Moreover, the most competitive open-source model only achieves 48% accuracy in resolving such conflicts. Our results underscore the need for targeted optimization in the future development of LMs.</description>

      <title>Tuning-Free Personalized Alignment via Trial-Error-Explain In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models are aligned to the collective voice of many, resulting in generic outputs that do not align with specific users' styles. In this work, we present Trial-Error-Explain In-Context Learning} (ITCL), a tuning-free method that personalizes language models for text generation tasks with fewer than 10 examples per user. TICL iteratively expands an in-context learning prompt via a trial-error-explain process, adding model-generated negative samples and explanations that provide fine-grained guidance towards a specific user's style. TICL achieves favorable win rates on pairwise comparisons with LLM-as-a-judge up to 91.5% against the previous state-of-the-art and outperforms competitive tuning-free baselines for personalized alignment tasks of writing emails, essays and news articles. Both lexical and qualitative analyses show that the negative samples and explanations enable language models to learn stylistic context more effectively and overcome the bias towards structural and formal phrases observed in their zero-shot outputs. By front-loading inference compute to create a user-specific in-context learning prompt that does not require extra generation steps at test time, TICL presents a novel yet simple approach for personalized alignment.</description>

      <title>Typhoon T1: An Open Thai Reasoning Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Typhoon T1, an open effort to develop an open Thai reasoning model. A reasoning model is a relatively new type of generative model built on top of large language models (LLMs). A reasoning model generates a long chain of thought before arriving at a final answer, an approach found to improve performance on complex tasks. However, details on developing such a model are limited, especially for reasoning models that can generate traces in a low-resource language. Typhoon T1 presents an open effort that dives into the details of developing a reasoning model in a more cost-effective way by leveraging supervised fine-tuning using open datasets, instead of reinforcement learning. This paper shares the details about synthetic data generation and training, as well as our dataset and model weights. Additionally, we provide insights gained from developing a reasoning model that generalizes across domains and is capable of generating reasoning traces in a low-resource language, using Thai as an example. We hope this open effort provides a foundation for further research in this field.</description>

      <title>Adapting Language-Specific LLMs to a Reasoning Model in One Day via Model Merging -- An Open Recipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates data selection and model merging methodologies aimed at incorporating advanced reasoning capabilities such as those of DeepSeek R1 into language-specific large language models (LLMs), with a particular focus on the Thai LLM. Our goal is to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs while maintaining their target language abilities. DeepSeek R1 excels in reasoning but primarily benefits high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. However, low-resource languages remain underserved due to the dominance of English-centric training data and model optimizations, which limit performance in these languages. This limitation results in unreliable code-switching and diminished effectiveness on tasks in low-resource languages. Meanwhile, local and regional LLM initiatives have attempted to bridge this gap by developing language-specific LLMs that focus on improving local linguistic fidelity. We demonstrate that, with only publicly available datasets and a computational budget of $120, it is possible to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs to match the level of DeepSeek R1, without compromising their performance on target language tasks.</description>

      <title>R2-KG: General-Purpose Dual-Agent Framework for Reliable Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12767v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have combined Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance reasoning, improving inference accuracy without additional training while mitigating hallucination. However, existing frameworks are often rigid, struggling to adapt to KG or task changes. They also rely heavily on powerful LLMs for reliable (i.e., trustworthy) reasoning. To address this, We introduce R2-KG, a plug-and-play, dual-agent framework that separates reasoning into two roles: an Operator (a low-capacity LLM) that gathers evidence and a Supervisor (a high-capacity LLM) that makes final judgments. This design is cost-efficient for LLM inference while still maintaining strong reasoning accuracy. Additionally, R2-KG employs an Abstention mechanism, generating answers only when sufficient evidence is collected from KG, which significantly enhances reliability. Experiments across multiple KG-based reasoning tasks show that R2-KG consistently outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reliability, regardless of the inherent capability of LLMs used as the Operator. Further experiments reveal that the single-agent version of R2-KG, equipped with a strict self-consistency strategy, achieves significantly higher-than-baseline reliability while reducing inference cost. However, it also leads to a higher abstention rate in complex KGs. Our findings establish R2-KG as a flexible and cost-effective solution for KG-based reasoning. It reduces reliance on high-capacity LLMs while ensuring trustworthy inference. The code is available at https://github.com/ekrxjwh2009/R2-KG/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General-purpose multilingual vector representations, used in retrieval, regression and classification, are traditionally obtained from bidirectional encoder models. Despite their wide applicability, encoders have been recently overshadowed by advances in generative decoder-only models. However, many innovations driving this progress are not inherently tied to decoders. In this paper, we revisit the development of multilingual encoders through the lens of these advances, and introduce EuroBERT, a family of multilingual encoders covering European and widely spoken global languages. Our models outperform existing alternatives across a diverse range of tasks, spanning multilingual capabilities, mathematics, and coding, and natively supporting sequences of up to 8,192 tokens. We also examine the design decisions behind EuroBERT, offering insights into our dataset composition and training pipeline. We publicly release the EuroBERT models, including intermediate training checkpoints, together with our training framework.</description>

      <title>Cognitive-Mental-LLM: Evaluating Reasoning in Large Language Models for Mental Health Prediction via Online Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in predicting mental health outcomes from online text, yet traditional classification methods often lack interpretability and robustness. This study evaluates structured reasoning techniques-Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency (SC-CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT)-to improve classification accuracy across multiple mental health datasets sourced from Reddit. We analyze reasoning-driven prompting strategies, including Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT, using key performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Sensitivity/Specificity. Our findings indicate that reasoning-enhanced techniques improve classification performance over direct prediction, particularly in complex cases. Compared to baselines such as Zero Shot non-CoT Prompting, and fine-tuned pre-trained transformers such as BERT and Mental-RoBerta, and fine-tuned Open Source LLMs such as Mental Alpaca and Mental-Flan-T5, reasoning-driven LLMs yield notable gains on datasets like Dreaddit (+0.52\% over M-LLM, +0.82\% over BERT) and SDCNL (+4.67\% over M-LLM, +2.17\% over BERT). However, performance declines in Depression Severity, and CSSRS predictions suggest dataset-specific limitations, likely due to our using a more extensive test set. Among prompting strategies, Few-shot CoT consistently outperforms others, reinforcing the effectiveness of reasoning-driven LLMs. Nonetheless, dataset variability highlights challenges in model reliability and interpretability. This study provides a comprehensive benchmark of reasoning-based LLM techniques for mental health text classification. It offers insights into their potential for scalable clinical applications while identifying key challenges for future improvements.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made tremendous progress in recent years, but low-resource languages, such as Tibetan, remain significantly underrepresented in their evaluation. Despite Tibetan being spoken by over seven million people, it has largely been neglected in the development and assessment of LLMs. To address this gap, we present TLUE (A Tibetan Language Understanding Evaluation Benchmark), the first large-scale benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities in Tibetan. TLUE comprises two major components: (1) a comprehensive multi-task understanding benchmark spanning 5 domains and 67 subdomains, and (2) a safety benchmark covering 7 subdomains. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that most LLMs perform below the random baseline, highlighting the considerable challenges LLMs face in processing Tibetan, a low-resource language. TLUE provides an essential foundation for driving future research and progress in Tibetan language understanding and underscores the need for greater inclusivity in LLM development.</description>

      <title>Bias Evaluation and Mitigation in Retrieval-Augmented Medical Question-Answering Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical Question Answering systems based on Retrieval Augmented Generation is promising for clinical decision support because they can integrate external knowledge, thus reducing inaccuracies inherent in standalone large language models (LLMs). However, these systems may unintentionally propagate or amplify biases associated with sensitive demographic attributes like race, gender, and socioeconomic factors. This study systematically evaluates demographic biases within medical RAG pipelines across multiple QA benchmarks, including MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU, and EquityMedQA. We quantify disparities in retrieval consistency and answer correctness by generating and analyzing queries sensitive to demographic variations. We further implement and compare several bias mitigation strategies to address identified biases, including Chain of Thought reasoning, Counterfactual filtering, Adversarial prompt refinement, and Majority Vote aggregation. Experimental results reveal significant demographic disparities, highlighting that Majority Vote aggregation notably improves accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings underscore the critical need for explicitly fairness-aware retrieval methods and prompt engineering strategies to develop truly equitable medical QA systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Bi-Elman Attention Networks: A Dual-Directional Context-Aware Test-Time Learning for Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text classification, a fundamental task in natural language processing, aims to categorize textual data into predefined labels. Traditional methods struggled with complex linguistic structures and semantic dependencies. However, the advent of deep learning, particularly recurrent neural networks and Transformer-based models, has significantly advanced the field by enabling nuanced feature extraction and context-aware predictions. Despite these improvements, existing models still exhibit limitations in balancing interpretability, computational efficiency, and long-range contextual understanding. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Dynamic Bidirectional Elman with Attention Network (DBEAN). DBEAN integrates bidirectional temporal modeling with self-attention mechanisms. It dynamically assigns weights to critical segments of input, improving contextual representation while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Poly-FEVER: A Multilingual Fact Verification Benchmark for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hallucinations in generative AI, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs), pose a significant challenge to the reliability of multilingual applications. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection focus primarily on English and a few widely spoken languages, lacking the breadth to assess inconsistencies in model performance across diverse linguistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce Poly-FEVER, a large-scale multilingual fact verification benchmark specifically designed for evaluating hallucination detection in LLMs. Poly-FEVER comprises 77,973 labeled factual claims spanning 11 languages, sourced from FEVER, Climate-FEVER, and SciFact. It provides the first large-scale dataset tailored for analyzing hallucination patterns across languages, enabling systematic evaluation of LLMs such as ChatGPT and the LLaMA series. Our analysis reveals how topic distribution and web resource availability influence hallucination frequency, uncovering language-specific biases that impact model accuracy. By offering a multilingual benchmark for fact verification, Poly-FEVER facilitates cross-linguistic comparisons of hallucination detection and contributes to the development of more reliable, language-inclusive AI systems. The dataset is publicly available to advance research in responsible AI, fact-checking methodologies, and multilingual NLP, promoting greater transparency and robustness in LLM performance. The proposed Poly-FEVER is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/HanzhiZhang/Poly-FEVER.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Antibiotic Discovery with Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of novel antibiotics is critical to address the growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, pharmaceutical industries face high costs (over $1 billion), long timelines, and a high failure rate, worsened by the rediscovery of known compounds. We propose an LLM-based pipeline that acts as an alarm system, detecting prior evidence of antibiotic activity to prevent costly rediscoveries. The system integrates organism and chemical literature into a Knowledge Graph (KG), ensuring taxonomic resolution, synonym handling, and multi-level evidence classification. We tested the pipeline on a private list of 73 potential antibiotic-producing organisms, disclosing 12 negative hits for evaluation. The results highlight the effectiveness of the pipeline for evidence reviewing, reducing false negatives, and accelerating decision-making. The KG for negative hits and the user interface for interactive exploration will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>WindowKV: Task-Adaptive Group-Wise KV Cache Window Selection for Efficient LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advancements in long-context inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the KV cache has become one of the foundational components. However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache compression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial scenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied by the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic coherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window selection method, WindowKV. WindowKV dynamically selects local semantic windows consisting of consecutive tokens, according to task-specific characteristics, ensuring the retained KV cache captures continuous, essential context. Additionally, we introduce an intra-group layer KV cache indices sharing strategy to reduce computational overhead, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency. We rigorously evaluate WindowKV on the LongBench benchmark, and the results demonstrate that it maintains a performance comparable to full KV cache retention while using only 12% of the original KV cache, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>AlphaSpace: Enabling Robotic Actions through Semantic Tokenization and Symbolic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents AlphaSpace, a novel methodology designed to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of language models for robotic manipulation in 3D Cartesian space. AlphaSpace employs a hierarchical semantics-based tokenization strategy that encodes spatial information at both coarse and fine-grained levels. Our approach represents objects with their attributes, positions, and height information through structured tokens, enabling precise spatial reasoning without relying on traditional vision-based embeddings. This approach enables LLMs to accurately manipulate objects by positioning them at specific (x, y, z) coordinates. Experimental results suggest that AlphaSpace demonstrates promising potential for improving manipulation tasks, achieving a total accuracy of 66.67%, compared to 37.5% for GPT-4o and 29.17% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet. These results demonstrate the potential of structured spatial encoding for manipulation tasks and warrant further exploration.</description>

      <title>Cross-Tokenizer Distillation via Approximate Likelihood Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distillation has shown remarkable success in transferring knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) teacher to a student LLM. However, current distillation methods predominantly require the same tokenizer between the teacher and the student, restricting their applicability to only a small subset of teacher-student pairs. In this work, we develop a cross-tokenizer distillation method to solve this crucial deficiency. Our method is the first to enable cross-tokenizer distillation without a next-token prediction loss as the main objective, instead purely maximizing the student predictions' similarity to the teacher's predictions (known as pure distillation), while also being robust to large mismatches between the teacher and the student tokenizer function and vocabulary. Empirically, our method enables substantially improved performance as tested on two use cases. First, we show that viewing tokenizer transfer as self-distillation enables unprecedently effective transfer across tokenizers. We transfer (subword-level) Llama and Gemma models to byte-level tokenization more effectively than prior methods transfer to a similar subword tokenizer under a comparable training budget. Transferring different base models to the same tokenizer also enables ensembling them (e.g., via averaging their predicted probabilities) which boosts performance. Second, we use our cross-tokenizer distillation method to distil a large maths-specialized LLM into a smaller model, achieving competitive maths problem-solving performance. Overall, our results make substantial strides toward better adaptability and enhanced interaction between different LLMs.</description>

Abstract: Reliable drug safety reference databases are essential for pharmacovigilance, yet existing resources like SIDER are outdated and static. We introduce PVLens, an automated system that extracts labeled safety information from FDA Structured Product Labels (SPLs) and maps terms to MedDRA. PVLens integrates automation with expert oversight through a web-based review tool. In validation against 97 drug labels, PVLens achieved an F1 score of 0.882, with high recall (0.983) and moderate precision (0.799). By offering a scalable, more accurate and continuously updated alternative to SIDER, PVLens enhances real-time pharamcovigilance with improved accuracy and contemporaneous insights.</description>

      <title>Beyond Believability: Accurate Human Behavior Simulation with Fine-Tuned LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research shows that LLMs can simulate ``believable'' human behaviors to power LLM agents via prompt-only methods. In this work, we focus on evaluating and improving LLM's objective ``accuracy'' rather than the subjective ``believability'' in the web action generation task, leveraging a large-scale, real-world dataset collected from online shopping human actions. We present the first comprehensive quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Llama, and Claude) on the task of web action generation. Our results show that fine-tuning LLMs on real-world behavioral data substantially improves their ability to generate actions compared to prompt-only methods. Furthermore, incorporating synthesized reasoning traces into model training leads to additional performance gains, demonstrating the value of explicit rationale in behavior modeling. This work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in behavior simulation and offers actionable insights into how real-world action data and reasoning augmentation can enhance the fidelity of LLM agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce methods for discovering and applying sparse feature circuits. These are causally implicated subnetworks of human-interpretable features for explaining language model behaviors. Circuits identified in prior work consist of polysemantic and difficult-to-interpret units like attention heads or neurons, rendering them unsuitable for many downstream applications. In contrast, sparse feature circuits enable detailed understanding of unanticipated mechanisms. Because they are based on fine-grained units, sparse feature circuits are useful for downstream tasks: We introduce SHIFT, where we improve the generalization of a classifier by ablating features that a human judges to be task-irrelevant. Finally, we demonstrate an entirely unsupervised and scalable interpretability pipeline by discovering thousands of sparse feature circuits for automatically discovered model behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern AI systems such as self-driving cars and game-playing agents achieve superhuman performance, but often lack human-like generalization, interpretability, and inter-operability with human users. Inspired by the rich interactions between language and decision-making in humans, we introduce Policy Learning with a Language Bottleneck (PLLB), a framework enabling AI agents to generate linguistic rules that capture the high-level strategies underlying rewarding behaviors. PLLB alternates between a *rule generation* step guided by language models, and an *update* step where agents learn new policies guided by rules, even when a rule is insufficient to describe an entire complex policy. Across five diverse tasks, including a two-player signaling game, maze navigation, image reconstruction, and robot grasp planning, we show that PLLB agents are not only able to learn more interpretable and generalizable behaviors, but can also share the learned rules with human users, enabling more effective human-AI coordination. We provide source code for our experiments at https://github.com/meghabyte/bottleneck .</description>

      <title>Whistle: Data-Efficient Multilingual and Crosslingual Speech Recognition via Weakly Phonetic Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist three approaches for multilingual and crosslingual automatic speech recognition (MCL-ASR) - supervised pretraining with phonetic or graphemic transcription, and self-supervised pretraining. We find that pretraining with phonetic supervision has been underappreciated so far for MCL-ASR, while conceptually it is more advantageous for information sharing between different languages. This paper explores the approach of pretraining with weakly phonetic supervision towards data-efficient MCL-ASR, which is called Whistle. We relax the requirement of gold-standard human-validated phonetic transcripts, and obtain International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) based transcription by leveraging the LanguageNet grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) models. We construct a common experimental setup based on the CommonVoice dataset, called CV-Lang10, with 10 seen languages and 2 unseen languages. A set of experiments are conducted on CV-Lang10 to compare, as fair as possible, the three approaches under the common setup for MCL-ASR. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of phoneme-based models (Whistle) for MCL-ASR, in terms of speech recognition for seen languages, crosslingual performance for unseen languages with different amounts of few-shot data, overcoming catastrophic forgetting, and training efficiency. It is found that when training data is more limited, phoneme supervision can achieve better results compared to subword supervision and self-supervision, thereby providing higher data-efficiency. To support reproducibility and promote future research along this direction, we release the code, models and data for the entire pipeline of Whistle at https://github.com/thu-spmi/CAT/tree/master/egs/cv-lang10.</description>

      <title>BACON: Improving Clarity of Image Captions via Bag-of-Concept Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in large Vision-Language Models have brought precise, accurate image captioning, vital for advancing multi-modal image understanding and processing. Yet these captions often carry lengthy, intertwined contexts that are difficult to parse and frequently overlook essential cues, posing a great barrier for models like GroundingDINO and SDXL, which lack the strong text encoding and syntax analysis needed to fully leverage dense captions. To address this, we propose BACON, a prompting method that breaks down VLM-generated captions into disentangled, structured elements such as objects, relationships, styles, and themes. This approach not only minimizes confusion from handling complex contexts but also allows for efficient transfer into a JSON dictionary, enabling models without linguistic processing capabilities to easily access key information. We annotated 100,000 image-caption pairs using BACON with GPT-4V and trained an LLaVA captioner on this dataset, enabling it to produce BACON-style captions without relying on costly GPT-4V. Evaluations of overall quality, precision, and recall-as well as user studies-demonstrate that the resulting caption model consistently outperforms other SOTA VLM models in generating high-quality captions. Besides, we show that BACON-style captions exhibit better clarity when applied to various models, enabling them to accomplish previously unattainable tasks or surpass existing SOTA solutions without training. For example, BACON-style captions help GroundingDINO achieve 1.51x higher recall scores on open-vocabulary object detection tasks compared to leading methods.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark for Multi-speaker Anonymization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving voice protection approaches primarily suppress privacy-related information derived from paralinguistic attributes while preserving the linguistic content. Existing solutions focus particularly on single-speaker scenarios. However, they lack practicality for real-world applications, i.e., multi-speaker scenarios. In this paper, we present an initial attempt to provide a multi-speaker anonymization benchmark by defining the task and evaluation protocol, proposing benchmarking solutions, and discussing the privacy leakage of overlapping conversations. The proposed benchmark solutions are based on a cascaded system that integrates spectral-clustering-based speaker diarization and disentanglement-based speaker anonymization using a selection-based anonymizer. To improve utility, the benchmark solutions are further enhanced by two conversation-level speaker vector anonymization methods. The first method minimizes the differential similarity across speaker pairs in the original and anonymized conversations, which maintains original speaker relationships in the anonymized version. The other minimizes the aggregated similarity across anonymized speakers, which achieves better differentiation between speakers.Experiments conducted on both non-overlap simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-speaker anonymization system with the proposed speaker anonymizers. Additionally, we analyzed overlapping speech regarding privacy leakage and provided potential solutions</description>

Abstract: In developing machine learning (ML) models for text classification, one common challenge is that the collected data is often not ideally distributed, especially when new classes are introduced in response to changes of data and tasks. In this paper, we present a solution for using visual analytics (VA) to guide the generation of synthetic data using large language models. As VA enables model developers to identify data-related deficiency, data synthesis can be targeted to address such deficiency. We discuss different types of data deficiency, describe different VA techniques for supporting their identification, and demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted data synthesis in improving model accuracy. In addition, we present a software tool, iGAiVA, which maps four groups of ML tasks into four VA views, integrating generative AI and VA into an ML workflow for developing and improving text classification models.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Information Flow in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in auto-regressive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising progress for vision-language tasks. While there exists a variety of studies investigating the processing of linguistic information within large language models, little is currently known about the inner working mechanism of MLLMs and how linguistic and visual information interact within these models. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by examining the information flow between different modalities -- language and vision -- in MLLMs, focusing on visual question answering. Specifically, given an image-question pair as input, we investigate where in the model and how the visual and linguistic information are combined to generate the final prediction. Conducting experiments with a series of models from the LLaVA series, we find that there are two distinct stages in the process of integration of the two modalities. In the lower layers, the model first transfers the more general visual features of the whole image into the representations of (linguistic) question tokens. In the middle layers, it once again transfers visual information about specific objects relevant to the question to the respective token positions of the question. Finally, in the higher layers, the resulting multimodal representation is propagated to the last position of the input sequence for the final prediction. Overall, our findings provide a new and comprehensive perspective on the spatial and functional aspects of image and language processing in the MLLMs, thereby facilitating future research into multimodal information localization and editing. Our code and collected dataset are released here: https://github.com/FightingFighting/cross-modal-information-flow-in-MLLM.git.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Vision-Language Models as Evaluators in Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their promise to perform complex reasoning, large language models (LLMs) have been shown to have limited effectiveness in end-to-end planning. This has inspired an intriguing question: if these models cannot plan well, can they still contribute to the planning framework as a helpful plan evaluator? In this work, we generalize this question to consider LLMs augmented with visual understanding, i.e., Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce PathEval, a novel benchmark evaluating VLMs as plan evaluators in complex path-planning scenarios. Succeeding in the benchmark requires a VLM to be able to abstract traits of optimal paths from the scenario description, demonstrate precise low-level perception on each path, and integrate this information to decide the better path. Our analysis of state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that these models face significant challenges on the benchmark. We observe that the VLMs can precisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit mixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision component presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive low-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue cannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific discriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to become effective path evaluators.</description>

      <title>Video-3D LLM: Learning Position-Aware Video Representation for 3D Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly impacted various multimodal tasks. However, these models face challenges in tasks that require spatial understanding within 3D environments. Efforts to enhance MLLMs, such as incorporating point cloud features, have been made, yet a considerable gap remains between the models' learned representations and the inherent complexity of 3D scenes. This discrepancy largely stems from the training of MLLMs on predominantly 2D data, which restricts their effectiveness in comprehending 3D spaces. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel generalist model, i.e., Video-3D LLM, for 3D scene understanding. By treating 3D scenes as dynamic videos and incorporating 3D position encoding into these representations, our Video-3D LLM aligns video representations with real-world spatial contexts more accurately. In addition, we have implemented a maximum coverage sampling technique to optimize the trade-off between computational cost and performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several 3D scene understanding benchmarks, including ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, Scan2Cap, ScanQA, and SQA3D.</description>

      <title>Ontology Matching with Large Language Models and Prioritized Depth-First Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) plays a key role in enabling data interoperability and knowledge sharing, but it remains challenging due to the need for large training datasets and limited vocabulary processing in machine learning approaches. Recently, methods based on Large Language Model (LLMs) have shown great promise in OM, particularly through the use of a retrieve-then-prompt pipeline. In this approach, relevant target entities are first retrieved and then used to prompt the LLM to predict the final matches. Despite their potential, these systems still present limited performance and high computational overhead. To address these issues, we introduce MILA, a novel approach that embeds a retrieve-identify-prompt pipeline within a prioritized depth-first search (PDFS) strategy. This approach efficiently identifies a large number of semantic correspondences with high accuracy, limiting LLM requests to only the most borderline cases. We evaluated MILA using the biomedical challenge proposed in the 2023 and 2024 editions of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative. Our method achieved the highest F-Measure in four of the five unsupervised tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art OM systems by up to 17%. It also performed better than or comparable to the leading supervised OM systems. MILA further exhibited task-agnostic performance, remaining stable across all tasks and settings, while significantly reducing LLM requests. These findings highlight that high-performance LLM-based OM can be achieved through a combination of programmed (PDFS), learned (embedding vectors), and prompting-based heuristics, without the need of domain-specific heuristics or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Towards a Design Guideline for RPA Evaluation: A Survey of Large Language Model-Based Role-Playing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Role-Playing Agent (RPA) is an increasingly popular type of LLM Agent that simulates human-like behaviors in a variety of tasks. However, evaluating RPAs is challenging due to diverse task requirements and agent designs. This paper proposes an evidence-based, actionable, and generalizable evaluation design guideline for LLM-based RPA by systematically reviewing 1,676 papers published between Jan. 2021 and Dec. 2024. Our analysis identifies six agent attributes, seven task attributes, and seven evaluation metrics from existing literature. Based on these findings, we present an RPA evaluation design guideline to help researchers develop more systematic and consistent evaluation methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have showcased an impressive capability to generalize well across various downstream tasks. These models leverage the synergy between visual and textual information, enabling them to understand and reason about the content present in images and text in a unified manner. This article provides a brief overview of CLIP based on few-shot prompt learning, including experimental data and technical characteristics of some methods. The purpose of this review is to provide a reference for researchers who have just started their research in generalizable prompting of CLIP through few-shot training for classification across 15 datasets and also to facilitate the integration of this field by researchers in other downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Time and Memory Trade-off of KV-Cache Compression in Tensor Transformer Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in the tensor version of transformers presents a significant bottleneck during inference. While previous work analyzes the fundamental space complexity barriers in standard attention mechanisms [Haris and Onak, 2025], our work generalizes the space complexity barriers result to tensor attention version. Our theoretical contributions rely on a reduction from communication complexity and deduce the memory lower bound for tensor-structured attention mechanisms when $d = \Omega(\log n)$. Furthermore, we introduce two types of tensor attention cache and present a trade-off between time and memory for two scenarios. Overall, our work provides a theoretical foundation for us to understand the time-memory tradeoff of KV-Cache compression in tensor attention decoding and offers more perspectives in developing more memory-efficient tensor attention Transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>ReSearch: Learning to Reason with Search for LLMs via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in reasoning, exemplified by the success of OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.</description>
