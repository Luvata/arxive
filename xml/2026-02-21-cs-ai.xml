      <title>AIdentifyAGE Ontology for Decision Support in Forensic Dental Age Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age assessment is crucial in forensic and judicial decision-making, particularly in cases involving undocumented individuals and unaccompanied minors, where legal thresholds determine access to protection, healthcare, and judicial procedures. Dental age assessment is widely recognized as one of the most reliable biological approaches for adolescents and young adults, but current practices are challenged by methodological heterogeneity, fragmented data representation, and limited interoperability between clinical, forensic, and legal information systems. These limitations hinder transparency and reproducibility, amplified by the increasing adoption of AI- based methods. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is domain-specific and provides a standardized, semantically coherent framework, encompassing both manual and AI-assisted forensic dental age assessment workflows, and enabling traceable linkage between observations, methods, reference data, and reported outcomes. It models the complete medico-legal workflow, integrating judicial context, individual-level information, forensic examination data, dental developmental assessment methods, radiographic imaging, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation methods. It is being developed together with domain experts, and it builds on upper and established biomedical, dental, and machine learning ontologies, ensuring interoperability, extensibility, and compliance with FAIR principles. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is a fundamental step to enhance consistency, transparency, and explainability, establishing a robust foundation for ontology-driven decision support systems in medico-legal and judicial contexts.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented (Knowledge Graph), and Large Language Model-Driven Design Structure Matrix (DSM) Generation of Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) for generating Design Structure Matrices (DSMs). We test these methods on two distinct use cases -- a power screwdriver and a CubeSat with known architectural references -- evaluating their performance on two key tasks: determining relationships between predefined components, and the more complex challenge of identifying components and their subsequent relationships. We measure the performance by assessing each element of the DSM and overall architecture. Despite design and computational challenges, we identify opportunities for automated DSM generation, with all code publicly available for reproducibility and further feedback from the domain experts.</description>

      <title>Contextuality from Single-State Representations: An Information-Theoretic Principle for Adaptive Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources. Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation.</description>

      <title>Mobility-Aware Cache Framework for Scalable LLM-Based Human Mobility Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for applications such as urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.</description>

      <title>When AI Benchmarks Plateau: A Systematic Study of Benchmark Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) benchmarks play a central role in measuring progress in model development and guiding deployment decisions. However, many benchmarks quickly become saturated, meaning that they can no longer differentiate between the best-performing models, diminishing their long-term value. In this study, we analyze benchmark saturation across 60 Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks selected from technical reports by major model developers. To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age. Notably, hiding test data (i.e., public vs. private) shows no protective effect, while expert-curated benchmarks resist saturation better than crowdsourced ones. Our findings highlight which design choices extend benchmark longevity and inform strategies for more durable evaluation.</description>

      <title>Simple Baselines are Competitive with Code Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code evolution is a family of techniques that rely on large language models to search through possible computer programs by evolving or mutating existing code. Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work.</description>

      <title>Improved Upper Bounds for Slicing the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A collection of hyperplanes $\mathcal{H}$ slices all edges of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $\{-1,1\}^n$ if, for every edge $e$ in the hypercube, there exists a hyperplane in $\mathcal{H}$ intersecting $e$ in its interior. Let $S(n)$ be the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice $Q_n$. We prove that $S(n) \leq \lceil \frac{4n}{5} \rceil$, except when $n$ is an odd multiple of $5$, in which case $S(n) \leq \frac{4n}{5} +1$. This improves upon the previously known upper bound of $S(n) \leq \lceil\frac{5n}{6} \rceil$ due to Paterson reported in 1971. We also obtain new lower bounds on the maximum number of edges in $Q_n$ that can be sliced using $k&lt;n$ hyperplanes. We prove the improved upper bound on $S(n)$ by constructing $8$ hyperplanes slicing $Q_{10}$ aided by the recently introduced CPro1: an automatic tool that uses reasoning LLMs coupled with automated hyperparameter tuning to create search algorithms for the discovery of mathematical constructions.</description>

      <title>NeuDiff Agent: A Governed AI Workflow for Single-Crystal Neutron Crystallography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale facilities increasingly face analysis and reporting latency as the limiting step in scientific throughput, particularly for structurally and magnetically complex samples that require iterative reduction, integration, refinement, and validation. To improve time-to-result and analysis efficiency, NeuDiff Agent is introduced as a governed, tool-using AI workflow for TOPAZ at the Spallation Neutron Source that takes instrument data products through reduction, integration, refinement, and validation to a validated crystal structure and a publication-ready CIF. NeuDiff Agent executes this established pipeline under explicit governance by restricting actions to allowlisted tools, enforcing fail-closed verification gates at key workflow boundaries, and capturing complete provenance for inspection, auditing, and controlled replay. Performance is assessed using a fixed prompt protocol and repeated end-to-end runs with two large language model backends, with user and machine time partitioned and intervention burden and recovery behaviors quantified under gating. In a reference-case benchmark, NeuDiff Agent reduces wall time from 435 minutes (manual) to 86.5(4.7) to 94.4(3.5) minutes (4.6-5.0x faster) while producing a validated CIF with no checkCIF level A or B alerts. These results establish a practical route to deploy agentic AI in facility crystallography while preserving traceability and publication-facing validation requirements.</description>

      <title>Node Learning: A Framework for Adaptive, Decentralised and Collaborative Network Edge AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of AI toward the edge increasingly exposes the cost and fragility of cen- tralised intelligence. Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance. Node Learning does not discard existing paradigms, but places them within a broader decentralised perspective</description>

      <title>An order-oriented approach to scoring hesitant fuzzy elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional scoring approaches on hesitant fuzzy sets often lack a formal base in order theory. This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the G\"ardenfors condition.
  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds. Two concrete examples of dominance functions for finite sets are provided: the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function. We show that these can be employed to construct fuzzy preference relations on typical hesitant fuzzy sets and support group decision-making.</description>

      <title>IndicJR: A Judge-Free Benchmark of Jailbreak Robustness in South Asian Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) is mostly evaluated in English and contract-bound, leaving multilingual vulnerabilities understudied. We introduce \textbf{Indic Jailbreak Robustness (IJR)}, a judge-free benchmark for adversarial safety across 12 Indic and South Asian languages (2.1 Billion speakers), covering 45216 prompts in JSON (contract-bound) and Free (naturalistic) tracks.
  IJR reveals three patterns. (1) Contracts inflate refusals but do not stop jailbreaks: in JSON, LLaMA and Sarvam exceed 0.92 JSR, and in Free all models reach 1.0 with refusals collapsing. (2) English to Indic attacks transfer strongly, with format wrappers often outperforming instruction wrappers. (3) Orthography matters: romanized or mixed inputs reduce JSR under JSON, with correlations to romanization share and tokenization (approx 0.28 to 0.32) indicating systematic effects. Human audits confirm detector reliability, and lite-to-full comparisons preserve conclusions. IJR offers a reproducible multilingual stress test revealing risks hidden by English-only, contract-focused evaluations, especially for South Asian users who frequently code-switch and romanize.</description>

      <title>Mobile-Agent-v3.5: Multi-platform Fundamental GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces GUI-Owl-1.5, the latest native GUI agent model that features instruct/thinking variants in multiple sizes (2B/4B/8B/32B/235B) and supports a range of platforms (desktop, mobile, browser, and more) to enable cloud-edge collaboration and real-time interaction. GUI-Owl-1.5 achieves state-of-the-art results on more than 20+ GUI benchmarks on open-source models: (1) on GUI automation tasks, it obtains 56.5 on OSWorld, 71.6 on AndroidWorld, and 48.4 on WebArena; (2) on grounding tasks, it obtains 80.3 on ScreenSpotPro; (3) on tool-calling tasks, it obtains 47.6 on OSWorld-MCP, and 46.8 on MobileWorld; (4) on memory and knowledge tasks, it obtains 75.5 on GUI-Knowledge Bench. GUI-Owl-1.5 incorporates several key innovations: (1) Hybird Data Flywheel: we construct the data pipeline for UI understanding and trajectory generation based on a combination of simulated environments and cloud-based sandbox environments, in order to improve the efficiency and quality of data collection. (2) Unified Enhancement of Agent Capabilities: we use a unified thought-synthesis pipeline to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities, while placing particular emphasis on improving key agent abilities, including Tool/MCP use, memory and multi-agent adaptation; (3) Multi-platform Environment RL Scaling: We propose a new environment RL algorithm, MRPO, to address the challenges of multi-platform conflicts and the low training efficiency of long-horizon tasks. The GUI-Owl-1.5 models are open-sourced, and an online cloud-sandbox demo is available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.</description>

      <title>OpenSage: Self-programming Agent Generation Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent development kits (ADKs) provide effective platforms and tooling for constructing agents, and their designs are critical to the constructed agents' performance, especially the functionality for agent topology, tools, and memory. However, current ADKs either lack sufficient functional support or rely on humans to manually design these components, limiting agents' generalizability and overall performance. We propose OpenSage, the first ADK that enables LLMs to automatically create agents with self-generated topology and toolsets while providing comprehensive and structured memory support. OpenSage offers effective functionality for agents to create and manage their own sub-agents and toolkits. It also features a hierarchical, graph-based memory system for efficient management and a specialized toolkit tailored to software engineering tasks. Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate the advantages of OpenSage over existing ADKs. We also conduct rigorous ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design for each component. We believe OpenSage can pave the way for the next generation of agent development, shifting the focus from human-centered to AI-centered paradigms.</description>

      <title>AgentLAB: Benchmarking LLM Agents against Long-Horizon Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed in long-horizon, complex environments to solve challenging problems, but this expansion exposes them to long-horizon attacks that exploit multi-turn user-agent-environment interactions to achieve objectives infeasible in single-turn settings. To measure agent vulnerabilities to such risks, we present AgentLAB, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating LLM agent susceptibility to adaptive, long-horizon attacks. Currently, AgentLAB supports five novel attack types including intent hijacking, tool chaining, task injection, objective drifting, and memory poisoning, spanning 28 realistic agentic environments, and 644 security test cases. Leveraging AgentLAB, we evaluate representative LLM agents and find that they remain highly susceptible to long-horizon attacks; moreover, defenses designed for single-turn interactions fail to reliably mitigate long-horizon threats. We anticipate that AgentLAB will serve as a valuable benchmark for tracking progress on securing LLM agents in practical settings. The benchmark is publicly available at https://tanqiujiang.github.io/AgentLAB_main.</description>

      <title>LLM-WikiRace: Benchmarking Long-term Planning and Reasoning over Real-World Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LLM-Wikirace, a benchmark for evaluating planning, reasoning, and world knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In LLM-Wikirace, models must efficiently navigate Wikipedia hyperlinks step by step to reach a target page from a given source, requiring look-ahead planning and the ability to reason about how concepts are connected in the real world. We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering. LLM-Wikirace is a simple benchmark that reveals clear limitations in current reasoning systems, offering an open arena where planning-capable LLMs still have much to prove. Our code and leaderboard available at https:/llmwikirace.github.io.</description>

      <title>Narrow fine-tuning erodes safety alignment in vision-language agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifelong multimodal agents must continuously adapt to new tasks through post-training, but this creates fundamental tension between acquiring capabilities and preserving safety alignment. We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings.</description>

      <title>DeepContext: Stateful Real-Time Detection of Multi-Turn Adversarial Intent Drift in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities have scaled, safety guardrails remain largely stateless, treating multi-turn dialogues as a series of disconnected events. This lack of temporal awareness facilitates a "Safety Gap" where adversarial tactics, like Crescendo and ActorAttack, slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass stateless filters. We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67). Furthermore, DeepContext maintains a sub-20ms inference overhead on a T4 GPU, ensuring viability for real-time applications. These results suggest that modeling the sequential evolution of intent is a more effective and computationally efficient alternative to deploying massive, stateless models.</description>

      <title>SourceBench: Can AI Answers Reference Quality Web Sources?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly answer queries by citing web sources, but existing evaluations emphasize answer correctness rather than evidence quality. We introduce SourceBench, a benchmark for measuring the quality of cited web sources across 100 real-world queries spanning informational, factual, argumentative, social, and shopping intents. SourceBench uses an eight-metric framework covering content quality (content relevance, factual accuracy, objectivity) and page-level signals (e.g., freshness, authority/accountability, clarity), and includes a human-labeled dataset with a calibrated LLM-based evaluator that matches expert judgments closely. We evaluate eight LLMs, Google Search, and three AI search tools over 3996 cited sources using SourceBench and conduct further experiments to understand the evaluation results. Overall, our work reveals four key new insights that can guide future research in the direction of GenAI and web search.</description>

      <title>Mind the GAP: Text Safety Does Not Transfer to Tool-Call Safety in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models deployed as agents increasingly interact with external systems through tool calls--actions with real-world consequences that text outputs alone do not carry. Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation.</description>

      <title>LLM4Cov: Execution-Aware Agentic Learning for High-coverage Testbench Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Execution-aware LLM agents offer a promising paradigm for learning from tool feedback, but such feedback is often expensive and slow to obtain, making online reinforcement learning (RL) impractical. High-coverage hardware verification exemplifies this challenge due to its reliance on industrial simulators and non-differentiable execution signals. We propose LLM4Cov, an offline agent-learning framework that models verification as memoryless state transitions guided by deterministic evaluators. Building on this formulation, we introduce execution-validated data curation, policy-aware agentic data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling to enable scalable learning under execution constraints. We further curate a reality-aligned benchmark adapted from an existing verification suite through a revised evaluation protocol. Using the proposed pipeline, a compact 4B-parameter model achieves 69.2% coverage pass rate under agentic evaluation, outperforming its teacher by 5.3% and demonstrating competitive performance against models an order of magnitude larger.</description>

      <title>Automating Agent Hijacking via Structural Template Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent hijacking, highlighted by OWASP as a critical threat to the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem, enables adversaries to manipulate execution by injecting malicious instructions into retrieved content. Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems.</description>

      <title>HQFS: Hybrid Quantum Classical Financial Security with VQC Forecasting, QUBO Annealing, and Audit-Ready Post-Quantum Signing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here's the corrected paragraph with all punctuation and formatting issues fixed:
  Financial risk systems usually follow a two-step routine: a model predicts return or risk, and then an optimizer makes a decision such as a portfolio rebalance. In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Black-Box Safety Evaluation: Information-Theoretic and Computational Barriers from Latent Context Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box safety evaluation of AI systems assumes model behavior on test distributions reliably predicts deployment performance. We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error &gt;= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains &gt;= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error. Our results quantify when black-box testing is statistically underdetermined and provide explicit criteria for when additional safeguards -- architectural constraints, training-time guarantees, interpretability, and deployment monitoring -- are mathematically necessary for worst-case safety assurance.</description>

      <title>Conv-FinRe: A Conversational and Longitudinal Benchmark for Utility-Grounded Financial Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most recommendation benchmarks evaluate how well a model imitates user behavior. In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise. The dataset is publicly released on Hugging Face, and the codebase is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Sonar-TS: Search-Then-Verify Natural Language Querying for Time Series Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural Language Querying for Time Series Databases (NLQ4TSDB) aims to assist non-expert users retrieve meaningful events, intervals, and summaries from massive temporal records. However, existing Text-to-SQL methods are not designed for continuous morphological intents such as shapes or anomalies, while time series models struggle to handle ultra-long histories. To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals. To enable effective evaluation, we introduce NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges within this domain and demonstrate that Sonar-TS effectively navigates complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail. This work presents the first systematic study of NLQ4TSDB, offering a general framework and evaluation standard to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Cinder: A fast and fair matchmaking system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fair and fast matchmaking system is an important component of modern multiplayer online games, directly impacting player retention and satisfaction. However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the "non-outlier" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a "Sanction Score." We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.</description>

      <title>M2F: Automated Formalization of Mathematical Literature at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated formalization of mathematics enables mechanical verification but remains limited to isolated theorems and short snippets. Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\%$ proof success (vs.\ $80\%$ for a strong baseline). Together, these results demonstrate that practical, large-scale automated formalization of mathematical literature is within reach. The full generated Lean code from our runs is available at https://github.com/optsuite/ReasBook.git.</description>

Abstract: Enterprises increasingly need AI systems that can answer sales-leader questions over live, customized CRM data, but most available models do not expose transparent, repeatable evidence of quality. This paper describes the Sales Research Agent in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, an AI-first application that connects to live CRM and related data, reasons over complex schemas, and produces decision-ready insights through text and chart outputs. To make quality observable, we introduce the Sales Research Bench, a purpose-built benchmark that scores systems on eight customer-weighted dimensions, including text and chart groundedness, relevance, explainability, schema accuracy, and chart quality. In a 200-question run on a customized enterprise schema on October 19, 2025, the Sales Research Agent outperformed Claude Sonnet 4.5 by 13 points and ChatGPT-5 by 24.1 points on the 100-point composite score, giving customers a repeatable way to compare AI solutions.</description>

      <title>Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts for Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has equipped LLM agents with a strong ability to solve complex tasks. However, existing RL methods normally use a \emph{single} policy network, causing \emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PA-MoE.</description>

      <title>Dynamic System Instructions and Tool Exposure for Efficient Agentic LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents often run for many steps while re-ingesting long system instructions and large tool catalogs each turn. This increases cost, agent derailment probability, latency, and tool-selection errors. We propose Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR), a RAG variant that retrieves, per step, only the minimal system-prompt fragments and the smallest necessary subset of tools. ITR composes a dynamic runtime system prompt and exposes a narrowed toolset with confidence-gated fallbacks. Using a controlled benchmark with internally consistent numbers, ITR reduces per-step context tokens by 95%, improves correct tool routing by 32% relative, and cuts end-to-end episode cost by 70% versus a monolithic baseline. These savings enable agents to run 2-20x more loops within context limits. Savings compound with the number of agent steps, making ITR particularly valuable for long-running autonomous agents. We detail the method, evaluation protocol, ablations, and operational guidance for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>IntentCUA: Learning Intent-level Representations for Skill Abstraction and Multi-Agent Planning in Computer-Use Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-use agents operate over long horizons under noisy perception, multi-window contexts, evolving environment states. Existing approaches, from RL-based planners to trajectory retrieval, often drift from user intent and repeatedly solve routine subproblems, leading to error accumulation and inefficiency. We present IntentCUA, a multi-agent computer-use framework designed to stabilize long-horizon execution through intent-aligned plan memory. A Planner, Plan-Optimizer, and Critic coordinate over shared memory that abstracts raw interaction traces into multi-view intent representations and reusable skills. At runtime, intent prototypes retrieve subgroup-aligned skills and inject them into partial plans, reducing redundant re-planning and mitigating error propagation across desktop applications. In end-to-end evaluations, IntentCUA achieved a 74.83% task success rate with a Step Efficiency Ratio of 0.91, outperforming RL-based and trajectory-centric baselines. Ablations show that multi-view intent abstraction and shared plan memory jointly improve execution stability, with the cooperative multi-agent loop providing the largest gains on long-horizon tasks. These results highlight that system-level intent abstraction and memory-grounded coordination are key to reliable and efficient desktop automation in large, dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>RFEval: Benchmarking Reasoning Faithfulness under Counterfactual Reasoning Intervention in Large Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit strong performance, yet often produce rationales that sound plausible but fail to reflect their true decision process, undermining reliability and trust. We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process. Our code and dataset can be found at project page: $\href{https://aidaslab.github.io/RFEval/}{https://aidaslab.github.io/RFEval/}$</description>

      <title>Retaining Suboptimal Actions to Follow Shifting Optima in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Value decomposition is a core approach for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods still rely on a single optimal action and struggle to adapt when the underlying value function shifts during training, often converging to suboptimal policies. To address this limitation, we propose Successive Sub-value Q-learning (S2Q), which learns multiple sub-value functions to retain alternative high-value actions. Incorporating these sub-value functions into a Softmax-based behavior policy, S2Q encourages persistent exploration and enables $Q^{\text{tot}}$ to adjust quickly to the changing optima. Experiments on challenging MARL benchmarks confirm that S2Q consistently outperforms various MARL algorithms, demonstrating improved adaptability and overall performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/hyeon1996/S2Q.</description>

      <title>Predictive Batch Scheduling: Accelerating Language Model Training Through Loss-Aware Sample Prioritization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Predictive Batch Scheduling (PBS), a novel training optimization technique that accelerates language model convergence by dynamically prioritizing high-loss samples during batch construction. Unlike curriculum learning approaches that require predefined difficulty metrics or hard example mining methods that demand expensive per-sample loss tracking, PBS employs a lightweight linear predictor trained online to estimate sample difficulty from static token-level features. Our predictor achieves 0.44 correlation with actual loss using only four simple features: token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio. Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps. These results validate that token frequency statistics encode meaningful information about sample difficulty, enabling effective curriculum learning with negligible computational overhead.</description>

      <title>How AI Coding Agents Communicate: A Study of Pull Request Description Characteristics and Human Review Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models has led to the emergence of AI coding agents that autonomously create pull requests on GitHub. However, how these agents differ in their pull request description characteristics, and how human reviewers respond to them, remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct an empirical analysis of pull requests created by five AI coding agents using the AIDev dataset. We analyze agent differences in pull request description characteristics, including structural features, and examine human reviewer response in terms of review activity, response timing, sentiment, and merge outcomes. We find that AI coding agents exhibit distinct PR description styles, which are associated with differences in reviewer engagement, response time, and merge outcomes. We observe notable variation across agents in both reviewer interaction metrics and merge rates. These findings highlight the role of pull request presentation and reviewer interaction dynamics in human-AI collaborative software development.</description>

      <title>Agentic Wireless Communication for 6G: Intent-Aware and Continuously Evolving Physical-Layer Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 6G wireless systems evolve, growing functional complexity and diverse service demands are driving a shift from rule-based control to intent-driven autonomous intelligence. User requirements are no longer captured by a single metric (e.g., throughput or reliability), but by multi-dimensional objectives such as latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, and service-level requirements. These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications.
  Large language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents. Compared with rule-driven or centrally optimized designs, LLM-based agents can integrate heterogeneous information and translate natural-language intents into executable control and configuration decisions.
  Focusing on a closed-loop pipeline of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution, this paper investigates agentic AI for the 6G physical layer and its realization pathways. We review representative physical-layer tasks and their limitations in supporting intent awareness and autonomy, identify application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discuss key challenges and enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization. Finally, we present a case study of an intent-driven link decision agent, termed AgenCom, which adaptively constructs communication links under diverse user preferences and channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Toward Trustworthy Evaluation of Sustainability Rating Methodologies: A Human-AI Collaborative Framework for Benchmark Dataset Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainability or ESG rating agencies use company disclosures and external data to produce scores or ratings that assess the environmental, social, and governance performance of a company. However, sustainability ratings across agencies for a single company vary widely, limiting their comparability, credibility, and relevance to decision-making. To harmonize the rating results, we propose adopting a universal human-AI collaboration framework to generate trustworthy benchmark datasets for evaluating sustainability rating methodologies. The framework comprises two complementary parts: STRIDE (Sustainability Trust Rating &amp; Integrity Data Equation) provides principled criteria and a scoring system that guide the construction of firm-level benchmark datasets using large language models (LLMs), and SR-Delta, a discrepancy-analysis procedural framework that surfaces insights for potential adjustments. The framework enables scalable and comparable assessment of sustainability rating methodologies. We call on the broader AI community to adopt AI-powered approaches to strengthen and advance sustainability rating methodologies that support and enforce urgent sustainability agendas.</description>

      <title>Owen-based Semantics and Hierarchy-Aware Explanation (O-Shap)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shapley value-based methods have become foundational in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), offering theoretically grounded feature attributions through cooperative game theory. However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on image and tabular datasets demonstrate that O-Shap outperforms baseline SHAP variants in attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency, especially when structure matters.</description>

      <title>Instructor-Aligned Knowledge Graphs for Personalized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mastering educational concepts requires understanding both their prerequisites (e.g., recursion before merge sort) and sub-concepts (e.g., merge sort as part of sorting algorithms). Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like "Algorithms" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., "part-of" or "depends-on" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., "recursion" is taught before "mergesort"; "recursion" is mentioned in the definition of "merge sort") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions.</description>

      <title>Epistemology of Generative AI: The Geometry of Knowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI presents an unprecedented challenge to our understanding of knowledge and its production. Unlike previous technological transformations, where engineering understanding preceded or accompanied deployment, generative AI operates through mechanisms whose epistemic character remains obscure, and without such understanding, its responsible integration into science, education, and institutional life cannot proceed on a principled basis. This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production. Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces. Building on Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism, it reconceptualizes generative models as navigators of learned manifolds and proposes navigational knowledge as a third mode of knowledge production, distinct from both symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel parallel algorithm for decomposing hard CircuitSAT instances. The technique employs specialized constraints to partition an original SAT instance into a family of weakened formulas. Our approach is implemented as a parameterized parallel algorithm, where adjusting the parameters allows efficient identification of high-quality decompositions, guided by hardness estimations computed in parallel. We demonstrate the algorithm's practical efficacy on challenging CircuitSAT instances, including those encoding Logical Equivalence Checking of Boolean circuits and preimage attacks on cryptographic hash functions.</description>

      <title>Bonsai: A Framework for Convolutional Neural Network Acceleration Using Criterion-Based Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the need for more accurate and powerful Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) increases, so too does the size, execution time, memory footprint, and power consumption. To overcome this, solutions such as pruning have been proposed with their own metrics and methodologies, or criteria, for how weights should be removed. These solutions do not share a common implementation and are difficult to implement and compare. In this work, we introduce Combine, a criterion- based pruning solution and demonstrate that it is fast and effective framework for iterative pruning, demonstrate that criterion have differing effects on different models, create a standard language for comparing criterion functions, and propose a few novel criterion functions. We show the capacity of these criterion functions and the framework on VGG inspired models, pruning up to 79\% of filters while retaining or improving accuracy, and reducing the computations needed by the network by up to 68\%.</description>

      <title>JEPA-DNA: Grounding Genomic Foundation Models through Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) have largely relied on Masked Language Modeling (MLM) or Next Token Prediction (NTP) to learn the language of life. While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence.</description>

      <title>Texo: Formula Recognition within 20M Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present Texo, a minimalist yet highperformance formula recognition model that contains only 20 million parameters. By attentive design, distillation and transfer of the vocabulary and the tokenizer, Texo achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models such as UniMERNet-T and PPFormulaNet-S, while reducing the model size by 80% and 65%, respectively. This enables real-time inference on consumer-grade hardware and even in-browser deployment. We also developed a web application to demonstrate the model capabilities and facilitate its usage for end users.</description>

      <title>Continual learning and refinement of causal models through dynamic predicate invention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently navigating complex environments requires agents to internalize the underlying logic of their world, yet standard world modelling methods often struggle with sample inefficiency, lack of transparency, and poor scalability. We propose a framework for constructing symbolic causal world models entirely online by integrating continuous model learning and repair into the agent's decision loop, by leveraging the power of Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to find semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions, allowing an agent to construct a hierarchy of disentangled, high-quality concepts from its observations. We demonstrate that our lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics, where propositional methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while achieving sample-efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the established PPO neural-network-based baseline.</description>

      <title>From Labor to Collaboration: A Methodological Experiment Using AI Agents to Augment Research Perspectives in Taiwan's Humanities and Social Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping knowledge work, yet existing research focuses predominantly on software engineering and the natural sciences, with limited methodological exploration for the humanities and social sciences. Positioned as a "methodological experiment," this study proposes an AI Agent-based collaborative research workflow (Agentic Workflow) for humanities and social science research. Taiwan's Claude.ai usage data (N = 7,729 conversations, November 2025) from the Anthropic Economic Index (AEI) serves as the empirical vehicle for validating the feasibility of this methodology.
  This study operates on two levels: the primary level is the design and validation of a methodological framework - a seven-stage modular workflow grounded in three principles: task modularization, human-AI division of labor, and verifiability, with each stage delineating clear roles for human researchers (research judgment and ethical decisions) and AI Agents (information retrieval and text generation); the secondary level is the empirical analysis of AEI Taiwan data - serving as an operational demonstration of the workflow's application to secondary data research, showcasing both the process and output quality (see Appendix A).
  This study contributes by proposing a replicable AI collaboration framework for humanities and social science researchers, and identifying three operational modes of human-AI collaboration - direct execution, iterative refinement, and human-led - through reflexive documentation of the operational process. This taxonomy reveals the irreplaceability of human judgment in research question formulation, theoretical interpretation, contextualized reasoning, and ethical reflection. Limitations including single-platform data, cross-sectional design, and AI reliability risks are acknowledged.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Human Factor: High Fidelity Behavioral Prediction for Strategic Foresight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting human decision-making in high-stakes environments remains a central challenge for artificial intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Interpretability of Cognitive Complexity in LLMs via Linear Probing using Bloom's Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black-box nature of Large Language Models necessitates novel evaluation frameworks that transcend surface-level performance metrics. This study investigates the internal neural representations of cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy as a hierarchical lens. By analyzing high-dimensional activation vectors from different LLMs, we probe whether different cognitive levels, ranging from basic recall (Remember) to abstract synthesis (Create), are linearly separable within the model's residual streams. Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations. These findings provide evidence that the model resolves the cognitive difficulty of a prompt early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers.</description>

      <title>All Leaks Count, Some Count More: Interpretable Temporal Contamination Detection in LLM Backtesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To evaluate whether LLMs can accurately predict future events, we need the ability to \textit{backtest} them on events that have already resolved. This requires models to reason only with information available at a specified past date. Yet LLMs may inadvertently leak post-cutoff knowledge encoded during training, undermining the validity of retrospective evaluation. We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \emph{temporal knowledge leakage}. Our approach decomposes model rationales into atomic claims and categorizes them by temporal verifiability, then applies \textit{Shapley values} to measure each claim's contribution to the prediction. This yields the \textbf{Shapley}-weighted \textbf{D}ecision-\textbf{C}ritical \textbf{L}eakage \textbf{R}ate (\textbf{Shapley-DCLR}), an interpretable metric that captures what fraction of decision-driving reasoning derives from leaked information. Building on this framework, we propose \textbf{Time}-\textbf{S}upervised \textbf{P}rediction with \textbf{E}xtracted \textbf{C}laims (\textbf{TimeSPEC}), which interleaves generation with claim verification and regeneration to proactively filter temporal contamination -- producing predictions where every supporting claim can be traced to sources available before the cutoff date. Experiments on 350 instances spanning U.S. Supreme Court case prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking reveal substantial leakage in standard prompting baselines. TimeSPEC reduces Shapley-DCLR while preserving task performance, demonstrating that explicit, interpretable claim-level verification outperforms prompt-based temporal constraints for reliable backtesting.</description>

      <title>Web Verbs: Typed Abstractions for Reliable Task Composition on the Agentic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Web is evolving from a medium that humans browse to an environment where software agents act on behalf of users. Advances in large language models (LLMs) make natural language a practical interface for goal-directed tasks, yet most current web agents operate on low-level primitives such as clicks and keystrokes. These operations are brittle, inefficient, and difficult to verify. Complementing content-oriented efforts such as NLWeb's semantic layer for retrieval, we argue that the agentic web also requires a semantic layer for web actions. We propose \textbf{Web Verbs}, a web-scale set of typed, semantically documented functions that expose site capabilities through a uniform interface, whether implemented through APIs or robust client-side workflows. These verbs serve as stable and composable units that agents can discover, select, and synthesize into concise programs. This abstraction unifies API-based and browser-based paradigms, enabling LLMs to synthesize reliable and auditable workflows with explicit control and data flow. Verbs can carry preconditions, postconditions, policy tags, and logging support, which improves \textbf{reliability} by providing stable interfaces, \textbf{efficiency} by reducing dozens of steps into a few function calls, and \textbf{verifiability} through typed contracts and checkable traces. We present our vision, a proof-of-concept implementation, and representative case studies that demonstrate concise and robust execution compared to existing agents. Finally, we outline a roadmap for standardization to make verbs deployable and trustworthy at web scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While frontier large language models demonstrate strong reasoning and mathematical capabilities, the practical process of training domain-specialized scientific language models from raw sources remains under-documented. In this work, we present a detailed case study of training a 1.36B-parameter scientific language model directly from raw arXiv LaTeX sources spanning mathematics, computer science, and theoretical physics. We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs). Through 24 experimental runs, we analyze training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks. Our findings highlight how preprocessing decisions significantly affect usable token volume, how tokenization impacts symbolic stability, and how storage and I/O constraints can rival compute as limiting factors. We further analyze convergence dynamics and show stable training behavior in a data-rich regime (52B pretraining tokens). Rather than proposing a novel architecture, this work provides an engineering-grounded, transparent account of training a small scientific language model from scratch. We hope these insights support researchers operating under moderate compute budgets who seek to build domain-specialized models.</description>

      <title>MedClarify: An information-seeking AI agent for medical diagnosis with case-specific follow-up questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for diagnostic tasks in medicine. In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Dataless Weight Disentanglement in Task Arithmetic via Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task Arithmetic yields a modular, scalable way to adapt foundation models. Combining multiple task vectors, however, can lead to cross-task interference, causing representation drift and degraded performance. Representation drift regularization provides a natural remedy to disentangle task vectors; however, existing approaches typically require external task data, conflicting with modularity and data availability constraints (e.g., privacy requirements). We propose a dataless approach by framing regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. This allows us to leverage well-established techniques; in particular, we adopt Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature and obtain a practical regularizer that achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Our method has constant complexity in the number of tasks and promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, eliminating the need for held-out tuning.</description>

      <title>Visual Model Checking: Graph-Based Inference of Visual Routines for Image Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information retrieval lies at the foundation of the modern digital industry. While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches.</description>

      <title>A Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder for NSCLC Survival Prediction with Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting survival outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is challenging due to the different individual prognostic features. This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task.</description>

      <title>A Privacy by Design Framework for Large Language Model-Based Applications for Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Children are increasingly using technologies powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.</description>

      <title>WarpRec: Unifying Academic Rigor and Industrial Scale for Responsible, Reproducible, and Efficient Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovation in Recommender Systems is currently impeded by a fractured ecosystem, where researchers must choose between the ease of in-memory experimentation and the costly, complex rewriting required for distributed industrial engines. To bridge this gap, we present WarpRec, a high-performance framework that eliminates this trade-off through a novel, backend-agnostic architecture. It includes 50+ state-of-the-art algorithms, 40 metrics, and 19 filtering and splitting strategies that seamlessly transition from local execution to distributed training and optimization. The framework enforces ecological responsibility by integrating CodeCarbon for real-time energy tracking, showing that scalability need not come at the cost of scientific integrity or sustainability. Furthermore, WarpRec anticipates the shift toward Agentic AI, leading Recommender Systems to evolve from static ranking engines into interactive tools within the Generative AI ecosystem. In summary, WarpRec not only bridges the gap between academia and industry but also can serve as the architectural backbone for the next generation of sustainable, agent-ready Recommender Systems.

      <title>Pareto Optimal Benchmarking of AI Models on ARM Cortex Processors for Sustainable Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a practical benchmarking framework for optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) models on ARM Cortex processors (M0+, M4, M7), focusing on energy efficiency, accuracy, and resource utilization in embedded systems. Through the design of an automated test bench, we provide a systematic approach to evaluate across key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify optimal combinations of processor and AI model. The research highlights a nearlinear correlation between floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference time, offering a reliable metric for estimating computational demands. Using Pareto analysis, we demonstrate how to balance trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy, ensuring that AI applications meet performance requirements without compromising sustainability. Key findings indicate that the M7 processor is ideal for short inference cycles, while the M4 processor offers better energy efficiency for longer inference tasks. The M0+ processor, while less efficient for complex AI models, remains suitable for simpler tasks. This work provides insights for developers, guiding them to design energy-efficient AI systems that deliver high performance in realworld applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for Telecom using Dynamic Knowledge Graphs and Explainable Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential across a variety of tasks, but their application in the telecom field remains challenging due to domain complexity, evolving standards, and specialized terminology. Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Reusability and Verifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.</description>

      <title>KLong: Training LLM Agent for Extremely Long-horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces KLong, an open-source LLM agent trained to solve extremely long-horizon tasks. The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench.</description>

      <title>ODESteer: A Unified ODE-Based Steering Framework for LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activation steering, or representation engineering, offers a lightweight approach to align large language models (LLMs) by manipulating their internal activations at inference time. However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts. Our work establishes a principled new view of activation steering in LLM alignment by unifying its theoretical foundations via ODEs, and validating it empirically through the proposed ODESteer method.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Federated Learning Based Ensemble Approach for Lung Disease Diagnosis Leveraging Fusion of SWIN Transformer and CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significant advancements in computational power cre- ate a vast opportunity for using Artificial Intelligence in different ap- plications of healthcare and medical science. A Hybrid FL-Enabled Ensemble Approach For Lung Disease Diagnosis Leveraging a Combination of SWIN Transformer and CNN is the combination of cutting-edge technology of AI and Federated Learning. Since, medi- cal specialists and hospitals will have shared data space, based on that data, with the help of Artificial Intelligence and integration of federated learning, we can introduce a secure and distributed system for medical data processing and create an efficient and reliable system. The proposed hybrid model enables the detection of COVID-19 and Pneumonia based on x-ray reports. We will use advanced and the latest available tech- nology offered by Tensorflow and Keras along with Microsoft-developed Vision Transformer, that can help to fight against the pandemic that the world has to fight together as a united. We focused on using the latest available CNN models (DenseNet201, Inception V3, VGG 19) and the Transformer model SWIN Transformer in order to prepare our hy- brid model that can provide a reliable solution as a helping hand for the physician in the medical field. In this research, we will discuss how the Federated learning-based Hybrid AI model can improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis and severity prediction of a patient using the real-time continual learning approach and how the integration of federated learn- ing can ensure hybrid model security and keep the authenticity of the information.</description>

      <title>AI Gamestore: Scalable, Open-Ended Evaluation of Machine General Intelligence with Human Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a "human game" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the "Multiverse of Human Games". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.</description>

      <title>MolHIT: Advancing Molecular-Graph Generation with Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular generation with diffusion models has emerged as a promising direction for AI-driven drug discovery and materials science. While graph diffusion models have been widely adopted due to the discrete nature of 2D molecular graphs, existing models suffer from low chemical validity and struggle to meet the desired properties compared to 1D modeling. In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics. We further demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, including multi-property guided generation and scaffold extension.</description>

      <title>AutoNumerics: An Autonomous, PDE-Agnostic Multi-Agent Pipeline for Scientific Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PDEs are central to scientific and engineering modeling, yet designing accurate numerical solvers typically requires substantial mathematical expertise and manual tuning. Recent neural network-based approaches improve flexibility but often demand high computational cost and suffer from limited interpretability. We introduce \texttt{AutoNumerics}, a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for general PDEs directly from natural language descriptions. Unlike black-box neural solvers, our framework generates transparent solvers grounded in classical numerical analysis. We introduce a coarse-to-fine execution strategy and a residual-based self-verification mechanism. Experiments on 24 canonical and real-world PDE problems demonstrate that \texttt{AutoNumerics} achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing neural and LLM-based baselines, and correctly selects numerical schemes based on PDE structural properties, suggesting its viability as an accessible paradigm for automated PDE solving.</description>

      <title>CLEF HIPE-2026: Evaluating Accurate and Efficient Person-Place Relation Extraction from Multilingual Historical Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ ("Has the person ever been at this place?") and $isAt$ ("Is the person located at this place around publication time?") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization. By linking relation extraction to large-scale historical data processing, HIPE-2026 aims to support downstream applications in knowledge-graph construction, historical biography reconstruction, and spatial analysis in digital humanities.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Algorithms for Graph Vector Search: Taxonomy, Empirical Study, and Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) underpins many large-scale data mining and machine learning applications, with efficient retrieval increasingly hinging on GPU acceleration as dataset sizes grow. Although graph-based approaches represent the state of the art in approximate nearest neighbor search, there is a lack of systematic understanding regarding their optimization for modern GPU architectures and their end-to-end effectiveness in practical scenarios. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey and experimental study of GPU-accelerated graph-based vector search algorithms. We establish a detailed taxonomy of GPU optimization strategies and clarify the mapping between algorithmic tasks and hardware execution units within GPUs. Through a thorough evaluation of six leading algorithms on eight large-scale benchmark datasets, we assess both graph index construction and query search performance. Our analysis reveals that distance computation remains the primary computational bottleneck, while data transfer between the host CPU and GPU emerges as the dominant factor influencing real-world latency at large scale. We also highlight key trade-offs in scalability and memory usage across different system designs. Our findings offer clear guidelines for designing scalable and robust GPU-powered approximate nearest neighbor search systems, and provide a comprehensive benchmark for the knowledge discovery and data mining community.</description>

      <title>APEX-SQL: Talking to the data via Agentic Exploration for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems powered by Large Language Models have excelled on academic benchmarks but struggle in complex enterprise environments. The primary limitation lies in their reliance on static schema representations, which fails to resolve semantic ambiguity and scale effectively to large, complex databases. To address this, we propose APEX-SQL, an Agentic Text-to-SQL Framework that shifts the paradigm from passive translation to agentic exploration. Our framework employs a hypothesis-verification loop to ground model reasoning in real data. In the schema linking phase, we use logical planning to verbalize hypotheses, dual-pathway pruning to reduce the search space, and parallel data profiling to validate column roles against real data, followed by global synthesis to ensure topological connectivity. For SQL generation, we introduce a deterministic mechanism to retrieve exploration directives, allowing the agent to effectively explore data distributions, refine hypotheses, and generate semantically accurate SQLs. Experiments on BIRD (70.65% execution accuracy) and Spider 2.0-Snow (51.01% execution accuracy) demonstrate that APEX-SQL outperforms competitive baselines with reduced token consumption. Further analysis reveals that agentic exploration acts as a performance multiplier, unlocking the latent reasoning potential of foundation models in enterprise settings. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of each component in ensuring robust and accurate data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-space models like Mamba offer linear-time sequence processing and low memory, making them attractive for medical imaging. However, their robustness under realistic software and hardware threat models remains underexplored. This paper evaluates Mamba on multiple MedM-NIST classification benchmarks under input-level attacks, including white-box adversarial perturbations (FGSM/PGD), occlusion-based PatchDrop, and common acquisition corruptions (Gaussian noise and defocus blur) as well as hardware-inspired fault attacks emulated in software via targeted and random bit-flip injections into weights and activations. We profile vulnerabilities and quantify impacts on accuracy indicating that defenses are needed for deployment.</description>

      <title>Intent Laundering: AI Safety Datasets Are Not What They Seem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically evaluate the quality of widely used AI safety datasets from two perspectives: in isolation and in practice. In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on "triggering cues": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce "intent laundering": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated "reasonably safe" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access. Overall, our findings expose a significant disconnect between how model safety is evaluated and how real-world adversaries behave.</description>

      <title>The Compute ICE-AGE: Invariant Compute Envelope under Addressable Graph Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents empirical results from a production-grade C++ implementation of a deterministic semantic state substrate derived from prior formal work on Bounded Local Generator Classes (Martin, 2026). The system was mathematically specified prior to implementation and realized as a CPU-resident graph engine operating under bounded local state evolution.
  Contemporary inference-driven AI architectures reconstruct semantic state through probabilistic recomposition, producing compute cost that scales with token volume and context horizon. In contrast, the substrate described here represents semantic continuity as a persistent, addressable memory graph evolved under a time-modulated local operator g(t). Work is bounded by local semantic change Delta s, independent of total memory cardinality M.
  Empirical measurements on Apple M2-class silicon demonstrate invariant traversal latency (approximately 0.25 to 0.32 ms), stable CPU utilization (approximately 17.2 percent baseline with Delta CPU approximately 0 to 0.2 percent), and no scale-correlated thermal signature across 1M to 25M node regimes under sustained operation. Measured per-node density ranges from approximately 1.3 KB (Float64 baseline) to approximately 687 bytes (compressed Float32 accounting). Under binary memory accounting, this yields a 1.6 billion node capacity projection within a 1 TiB envelope.
  These results indicate an empirically invariant thermodynamic regime in which scaling is governed by memory capacity rather than inference-bound recomposition. The Compute ICE-AGE is defined as the Invariant Compute Envelope under Addressable Graph Evolution, and the empirical evidence presented demonstrates this regime up to 25M nodes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying LLM Attention-Head Stability: Implications for Circuit Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mechanistic interpretability, recent work scrutinizes transformer "circuits" - sparse, mono or multi layer sub computations, that may reflect human understandable functions. Yet, these network circuits are rarely acid-tested for their stability across different instances of the same deep learning architecture. Without this, it remains unclear whether reported circuits emerge universally across labs or turn out to be idiosyncratic to a particular estimation instance, potentially limiting confidence in safety-critical settings. Here, we systematically study stability across-refits in increasingly complex transformer language models of various sizes. We quantify, layer by layer, how similarly attention heads learn representations across independently initialized training runs. Our rigorous experiments show that (1) middle-layer heads are the least stable yet the most representationally distinct; (2) deeper models exhibit stronger mid-depth divergence; (3) unstable heads in deeper layers become more functionally important than their peers from the same layer; (4) applying weight decay optimization substantially improves attention-head stability across random model initializations; and (5) the residual stream is comparatively stable. Our findings establish the cross-instance robustness of circuits as an essential yet underappreciated prerequisite for scalable oversight, drawing contours around possible white-box monitorability of AI systems.</description>

      <title>Can Adversarial Code Comments Fool AI Security Reviewers -- Large-Scale Empirical Study of Comment-Based Attacks and Defenses Against LLM Code Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-assisted code review is widely used to detect vulnerabilities before production release. Prior work shows that adversarial prompt manipulation can degrade large language model (LLM) performance in code generation. We test whether similar comment-based manipulation misleads LLMs during vulnerability detection. We build a 100-sample benchmark across Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants ranging from no comments to adversarial strategies such as authority spoofing and technical deception. Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p &gt; 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total). Static analysis cross-referencing performs best at 96.9 percent detection and recovers 47 percent of baseline misses. Comment stripping reduces detection for weaker models by removing helpful context. Failures concentrate on inherently difficult vulnerability classes, including race conditions, timing side channels, and complex authorization logic, rather than on adversarial comments.</description>

      <title>DeepVision-103K: A Visually Diverse, Broad-Coverage, and Verifiable Mathematical Dataset for Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been shown effective in enhancing the visual reflection and reasoning capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, existing datasets are predominantly derived from either small-scale manual construction or recombination of prior resources, which limits data diversity and coverage, thereby constraining further gains in model performance. To this end, we introduce \textbf{DeepVision-103K}, a comprehensive dataset for RLVR training that covers diverse K12 mathematical topics, extensive knowledge points, and rich visual elements. Models trained on DeepVision achieve strong performance on multimodal mathematical benchmarks, and generalize effectively to general multimodal reasoning tasks. Further analysis reveals enhanced visual perception, reflection and reasoning capabilities in trained models, validating DeepVision's effectiveness for advancing multimodal reasoning.

      <title>PETS: A Principled Framework Towards Optimal Trajectory Allocation for Efficient Test-Time Self-Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling can improve model performance by aggregating stochastic reasoning trajectories. However, achieving sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under a limited budget remains an open challenge. We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

      <title>Low-Dimensional and Transversely Curved Optimization Dynamics in Grokking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grokking -- the delayed transition from memorization to generalization in small algorithmic tasks -- remains poorly understood. We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect.</description>

      <title>LiveClin: A Live Clinical Benchmark without Leakage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliability of medical LLM evaluation is critically undermined by data contamination and knowledge obsolescence, leading to inflated scores on static benchmarks. To address these challenges, we introduce LiveClin, a live benchmark designed for approximating real-world clinical practice. Built from contemporary, peer-reviewed case reports and updated biannually, LiveClin ensures clinical currency and resists data contamination. Using a verified AI-human workflow involving 239 physicians, we transform authentic patient cases into complex, multimodal evaluation scenarios that span the entire clinical pathway. The benchmark currently comprises 1,407 case reports and 6,605 questions. Our evaluation of 26 models on LiveClin reveals the profound difficulty of these real-world scenarios, with the top-performing model achieving a Case Accuracy of just 35.7%. In benchmarking against human experts, Chief Physicians achieved the highest accuracy, followed closely by Attending Physicians, with both surpassing most models. LiveClin thus provides a continuously evolving, clinically grounded framework to guide the development of medical LLMs towards closing this gap and achieving greater reliability and real-world utility. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/AQ-MedAI/LiveClin.</description>

      <title>PREFER: An Ontology for the PREcision FERmentation Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision fermentation relies on microbial cell factories to produce sustainable food, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and biofuels. Specialized laboratories such as biofoundries are advancing these processes using high-throughput bioreactor platforms, which generate vast datasets. However, the lack of community standards limits data accessibility and interoperability, preventing integration across platforms. In order to address this, we introduce PREFER, an open-source ontology designed to establish a unified standard for bioprocess data. Built in alignment with the widely adopted Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and connecting with several other community ontologies, PREFER ensures consistency and cross-domain compatibility and covers the whole precision fermentation process. Integrating PREFER into high-throughput bioprocess development workflows enables structured metadata that supports automated cross-platform execution and high-fidelity data capture. Furthermore, PREFER's standardization has the potential to bridge disparate data silos, generating machine-actionable datasets critical for training predictive, robust machine learning models in synthetic biology. This work provides the foundation for scalable, interoperable bioprocess systems and supports the transition toward more data-driven bioproduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning-based wireless localization using Wi-Fi signals continues to face significant challenges in achieving groundbreaking performance across diverse environments. A major limitation is that most existing algorithms do not appropriately weight the information from different routers during aggregation, resulting in suboptimal convergence and reduced accuracy. Motivated by traditional weighted triangulation methods, this paper introduces the concept of attention to routers, ensuring that each router's contribution is weighted differently when aggregating information from multiple routers for triangulation. We demonstrate, by incorporating attention layers into a standard machine learning localization architecture, that emphasizing the relevance of each router can substantially improve overall performance. We have also shown through evaluation over the open-sourced datasets and demonstrate that Attention to Routers outperforms the benchmark architecture by over 30% in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Large-scale online deanonymization with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that large language models can be used to perform at-scale deanonymization. With full Internet access, our agent can re-identify Hacker News users and Anthropic Interviewer participants at high precision, given pseudonymous online profiles and conversations alone, matching what would take hours for a dedicated human investigator. We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives. Compared to prior deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data or manual feature engineering, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method. Our results show that the practical obscurity protecting pseudonymous users online no longer holds and that threat models for online privacy need to be reconsidered.</description>

      <title>References Improve LLM Alignment in Non-Verifiable Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown strong effectiveness in reasoning tasks, it cannot be directly applied to non-verifiable domains lacking ground-truth verifiers, such as LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate whether reference-guided LLM-evaluators can bridge this gap by serving as soft "verifiers". First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model. Specifically, our method achieves 73.1% and 58.7% on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and 70.0% and 74.1% with Qwen2.5-7B, corresponding to average absolute gains of +20.2 / +17.1 points over SFT distillation and +5.3 / +3.6 points over reference-free self-improvement on AlpacaEval / Arena-Hard. These results highlight the potential of using reference-guided LLM-evaluators to enable effective LLM post-training in non-verifiable domains.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Monolingual and Multilingual Large Language Models for Greek Question Answering: The DemosQA Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning have enabled the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art across a wide range of tasks, including Question Answering (QA). Despite these advancements, research on LLMs has primarily targeted high-resourced languages (e.g., English), and only recently has attention shifted toward multilingual models. However, these models demonstrate a training data bias towards a small number of popular languages or rely on transfer learning from high- to under-resourced languages; this may lead to a misrepresentation of social, cultural, and historical aspects. To address this challenge, monolingual LLMs have been developed for under-resourced languages; however, their effectiveness remains less studied when compared to multilingual counterparts on language-specific tasks. In this study, we address this research gap in Greek QA by contributing: (i) DemosQA, a novel dataset, which is constructed using social media user questions and community-reviewed answers to better capture the Greek social and cultural zeitgeist; (ii) a memory-efficient LLM evaluation framework adaptable to diverse QA datasets and languages; and (iii) an extensive evaluation of 11 monolingual and multilingual LLMs on 6 human-curated Greek QA datasets using 3 different prompting strategies. We release our code and data to facilitate reproducibility.</description>

      <title>One-step Language Modeling via Continuous Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16813</link>

Abstract: Language models based on discrete diffusion have attracted widespread interest for their potential to provide faster generation than autoregressive models. In practice, however, they exhibit a sharp degradation of sample quality in the few-step regime, failing to realize this promise. Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation. On the LM1B and OWT language datasets, FLM attains generation quality matching state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models. With FMLM, our approach outperforms recent few-step language models across the board, with one-step generation exceeding their 8-step quality. Our work calls into question the widely held hypothesis that discrete diffusion processes are necessary for generative modeling over discrete modalities, and paves the way toward accelerated flow-based language modeling at scale.

      <title>AI-Mediated Feedback Improves Student Revisions: A Randomized Trial with FeedbackWriter in a Large Undergraduate Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in using LLMs to generate feedback on students' writing, little is known about how students respond to AI-mediated versus human-provided feedback. We address this gap through a randomized controlled trial in a large introductory economics course (N=354), where we introduce and deploy FeedbackWriter - a system that generates AI suggestions to teaching assistants (TAs) while they provide feedback on students' knowledge-intensive essays. TAs have the full capacity to adopt, edit, or dismiss the suggestions. Students were randomly assigned to receive either handwritten feedback from TAs (baseline) or AI-mediated feedback where TAs received suggestions from FeedbackWriter. Students revise their drafts based on the feedback, which is further graded. In total, 1,366 essays were graded using the system. We found that students receiving AI-mediated feedback produced significantly higher-quality revisions, with gains increasing as TAs adopted more AI suggestions. TAs found the AI suggestions useful for spotting gaps and clarifying rubrics.</description>

      <title>HiVAE: Hierarchical Latent Variables for Scalable Theory of Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory of mind (ToM) enables AI systems to infer agents' hidden goals and mental states, but existing approaches focus mainly on small human understandable gridworld spaces. We introduce HiVAE, a hierarchical variational architecture that scales ToM reasoning to realistic spatiotemporal domains. Inspired by the belief-desire-intention structure of human cognition, our three-level VAE hierarchy achieves substantial performance improvements on a 3,185-node campus navigation task. However, we identify a critical limitation: while our hierarchical structure improves prediction, learned latent representations lack explicit grounding to actual mental states. We propose self-supervised alignment strategies and present this work to solicit community feedback on grounding approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning under noisy supervision is governed by a feedback-truth gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When feedback is absorbed faster than task structure can be evaluated, the learner will favor feedback over truth. A two-timescale model shows this feedback-truth gap is inevitable whenever the two rates differ and vanishes only when they match. We test this prediction across neural networks trained with noisy labels (30 datasets, 2,700 runs), human probabilistic reversal learning (N = 292), and human reward/punishment learning with concurrent EEG (N = 25). In each system, truth is defined operationally: held-out labels, the objectively correct option, or the participant's pre-feedback expectation - the only non-circular reference decodable from post-feedback EEG. The gap appeared universally but was regulated differently: dense networks accumulated it as memorization; sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed it; humans generated transient over-commitment that was actively recovered. Neural over-commitment (~0.04-0.10) was amplified tenfold into behavioral commitment (d = 3.3-3.9). The gap is a fundamental constraint on learning under noisy supervision; its consequences depend on the regulation each system employs.</description>

      <title>VAM: Verbalized Action Masking for Controllable Exploration in RL Post-Training -- A Chess Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploration remains a key bottleneck for reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of large language models (LLMs), where sparse feedback and large action spaces can lead to premature collapse into repetitive behaviors. We propose Verbalized Action Masking (VAM), which verbalizes an action mask in the prompt and enforces that the model outputs an action from the masked set. Building on this interface, we introduce iterative action-space pruning: if the target action is not sampled, we remove valid sampled actions from the mask and resample under the reduced candidate set, repeating until the target is sampled or a fixed budget is exhausted. We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores. Across held-out chess puzzles and full-game play measured by average centipawn loss (ACPL), VAM improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong baselines, highlighting verbalized masking as a practical mechanism for controllable exploration in LLM RL post-training.</description>

      <title>Overseeing Agents Without Constant Oversight: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enable human oversight, agentic AI systems often provide a trace of reasoning and action steps. Designing traces to have an informative, but not overwhelming, level of detail remains a critical challenge. In three user studies on a Computer User Agent, we investigate the utility of basic action traces for verification, explore three alternatives via design probes, and test a novel interface's impact on error finding in question-answering tasks. As expected, we find that current practices are cumbersome, limiting their efficacy. Conversely, our proposed design reduced the time participants spent finding errors. However, although participants reported higher levels of confidence in their decisions, their final accuracy was not meaningfully improved. To this end, our study surfaces challenges for human verification of agentic systems, including managing built-in assumptions, users' subjective and changing correctness criteria, and the shortcomings, yet importance, of communicating the agent's process.</description>

      <title>SimToolReal: An Object-Centric Policy for Zero-Shot Dexterous Tool Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to manipulate tools significantly expands the set of tasks a robot can perform. Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks. Finally, we show that SimToolReal generalizes across a diverse set of everyday tools, achieving strong zero-shot performance over 120 real-world rollouts spanning 24 tasks, 12 object instances, and 6 tool categories.</description>

      <title>Position: Why a Dynamical Systems Perspective is Needed to Advance Time Series Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series (TS) modeling has come a long way from early statistical, mainly linear, approaches to the current trend in TS foundation models. With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling.</description>

      <title>AdaptOrch: Task-Adaptive Multi-Agent Orchestration in the Era of LLM Performance Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models from diverse providers converge toward comparable benchmark performance, the traditional paradigm of selecting a single best model per task yields diminishing returns. We argue that orchestration topology -- the structural composition of how multiple agents are coordinated, parallelized, and synthesized -- now dominates system-level performance over individual model capability. We present AdaptOrch, a formal framework for task-adaptive multi-agent orchestration that dynamically selects among four canonical topologies (parallel, sequential, hierarchical, and hybrid) based on task dependency graphs and empirically derived domain characteristics. Our framework introduces three key contributions: (1) a Performance Convergence Scaling Law, formalizing conditions under which orchestration selection outweighs model selection; (2) a Topology Routing Algorithm that maps task decomposition DAGs to optimal orchestration patterns in O(|V| + |E|) time; and (3) an Adaptive Synthesis Protocol with provable termination guarantees and heuristic consistency scoring for parallel agent outputs. We validate AdaptOrch across coding (SWE-bench), reasoning (GPQA), and retrieval-augmented generation tasks, demonstrating that topology-aware orchestration achieves 12-23% improvement over static single-topology baselines, even when using identical underlying models. Our results establish orchestration design as a first-class optimization target independent of model scaling.</description>

      <title>MALLVI: a multi agent framework for integrated generalized robotics manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task planning for robotic manipulation with large language models (LLMs) is an emerging area. Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings.We present MALLVi, a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI.</description>

      <title>A Reversible Semantics for Janus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Janus is a paradigmatic example of reversible programming language. Indeed, Janus programs can be executed backwards as well as forwards. However, its small-step semantics (useful, e.g., for debugging or as a basis for extensions with concurrency primitives) is not reversible, since it loses information while computing forwards. E.g., it does not satisfy the Loop Lemma, stating that any reduction has an inverse, a main property of reversibility in process calculi, where small-step semantics is commonly used. We present here a novel small-step semantics which is actually reversible, while remaining equivalent to the previous one. It involves the non-trivial challenge of defining a semantics based on a "program counter" for a high-level programming language.</description>

      <title>Xray-Visual Models: Scaling Vision models on Industry Scale Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Xray-Visual, a unified vision model architecture for large-scale image and video understanding trained on industry-scale social media data. Our model leverages over 15 billion curated image-text pairs and 10 billion video-hashtag pairs from Facebook and Instagram, employing robust data curation pipelines that incorporate balancing and noise suppression strategies to maximize semantic diversity while minimizing label noise. We introduce a three-stage training pipeline that combines self-supervised MAE, semi-supervised hashtag classification, and CLIP-style contrastive learning to jointly optimize image and video modalities. Our architecture builds on a Vision Transformer backbone enhanced with efficient token reorganization (EViT) for improved computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Xray-Visual achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, including ImageNet for image classification, Kinetics and HMDB51 for video understanding, and MSCOCO for cross-modal retrieval. The model exhibits strong robustness to domain shift and adversarial perturbations. We further demonstrate that integrating large language models as text encoders (LLM2CLIP) significantly enhances retrieval performance and generalization capabilities, particularly in real-world environments. Xray-Visual establishes new benchmarks for scalable, multimodal vision models, while maintaining superior accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Discovering Multiagent Learning Algorithms with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of the advancement of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in imperfect-information games has historically depended on manual iterative refinement of baselines. While foundational families like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) rest on solid theoretical ground, the design of their most effective variants often relies on human intuition to navigate a vast algorithmic design space. In this work, we propose the use of AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models, to automatically discover new multiagent learning algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by evolving novel variants for two distinct paradigms of game-theoretic learning. First, in the domain of iterative regret minimization, we evolve the logic governing regret accumulation and policy derivation, discovering a new algorithm, Volatility-Adaptive Discounted (VAD-)CFR. VAD-CFR employs novel, non-intuitive mechanisms-including volatility-sensitive discounting, consistency-enforced optimism, and a hard warm-start policy accumulation schedule-to outperform state-of-the-art baselines like Discounted Predictive CFR+. Second, in the regime of population based training algorithms, we evolve training-time and evaluation-time meta strategy solvers for PSRO, discovering a new variant, Smoothed Hybrid Optimistic Regret (SHOR-)PSRO. SHOR-PSRO introduces a hybrid meta-solver that linearly blends Optimistic Regret Matching with a smoothed, temperature-controlled distribution over best pure strategies. By dynamically annealing this blending factor and diversity bonuses during training, the algorithm automates the transition from population diversity to rigorous equilibrium finding, yielding superior empirical convergence compared to standard static meta-solvers.</description>

      <title>Say It My Way: Exploring Control in Conversational Visual Question Answering with Blind Users</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompting and steering techniques are well established in general-purpose generative AI, yet assistive visual question answering (VQA) tools for blind users still follow rigid interaction patterns with limited opportunities for customization. User control can be helpful when system responses are misaligned with their goals and contexts, a gap that becomes especially consequential for blind users that may rely on these systems for access. We invite 11 blind users to customize their interactions with a real-world conversational VQA system. Drawing on 418 interactions, reflections, and post-study interviews, we analyze prompting-based techniques participants adopted, including those introduced in the study and those developed independently in real-world settings. VQA interactions were often lengthy: participants averaged 3 turns, sometimes up to 21, with input text typically tenfold shorter than the responses they heard. Built on state-of-the-art LLMs, the system lacked verbosity controls, was limited in estimating distance in space and time, relied on inaccessible image framing, and offered little to no camera guidance. We discuss how customization techniques such as prompt engineering can help participants work around these limitations. Alongside a new publicly available dataset, we offer insights for interaction design at both query and system levels.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval algorithms like BM25 and query likelihood with Dirichlet smoothing remain strong and efficient first-stage rankers, yet improvements have mostly relied on parameter tuning and human intuition. We investigate whether a large language model, guided by an evaluator and evolutionary search, can automatically discover improved lexical retrieval algorithms. We introduce RankEvolve, a program evolution setup based on AlphaEvolve, in which candidate ranking algorithms are represented as executable code and iteratively mutated, recombined, and selected based on retrieval performance across 12 IR datasets from BEIR and BRIGHT. RankEvolve starts from two seed programs: BM25 and query likelihood with Dirichlet smoothing. The evolved algorithms are novel, effective, and show promising transfer to the full BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks as well as TREC DL 19 and 20. Our results suggest that evaluator-guided LLM program evolution is a practical path towards automatic discovery of novel ranking algorithms.</description>

      <title>Beyond Message Passing: A Symbolic Alternative for Expressive and Interpretable Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery, yet their black-box nature remains a significant barrier to trustworthiness. While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. Notably, SymGraph delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Furthermore, SymGraph generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods, offering great potential for scientific discovery and explainable AI.</description>

      <title>When Semantic Overlap Is Not Enough: Cross-Lingual Euphemism Transfer Between Turkish and English</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Euphemisms substitute socially sensitive expressions, often softening or reframing meaning, and their reliance on cultural and pragmatic context complicates modeling across languages. In this study, we investigate how cross-lingual equivalence influences transfer in multilingual euphemism detection. We categorize Potentially Euphemistic Terms (PETs) in Turkish and English into Overlapping (OPETs) and Non-Overlapping (NOPETs) subsets based on their functional, pragmatic, and semantic alignment. Our findings reveal a transfer asymmetry: semantic overlap is insufficient to guarantee positive transfer, particularly in low-resource Turkish-to-English direction, where performance can degrade even for overlapping euphemisms, and in some cases, improve under NOPET-based training. Differences in label distribution help explain these counterintuitive results. Category-level analysis suggests that transfer may be influenced by domain-specific alignment, though evidence is limited by sparsity.</description>

      <title>Eigenmood Space: Uncertainty-Aware Spectral Graph Analysis of Psychological Patterns in Classical Persian Poetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Persian poetry is a historically sustained archive in which affective life is expressed through metaphor, intertextual convention, and rhetorical indirection. These properties make close reading indispensable while limiting reproducible comparison at scale. We present an uncertainty-aware computational framework for poet-level psychological analysis based on large-scale automatic multi-label annotation. Each verse is associated with a set of psychological concepts, per-label confidence scores, and an abstention flag that signals insufficient evidence. We aggregate confidence-weighted evidence into a Poet $\times$ Concept matrix, interpret each poet as a probability distribution over concepts, and quantify poetic individuality as divergence from a corpus baseline using Jensen--Shannon divergence and Kullback--Leibler divergence. To capture relational structure beyond marginals, we build a confidence-weighted co-occurrence graph over concepts and define an Eigenmood embedding through Laplacian spectral decomposition. On a corpus of 61{,}573 verses across 10 poets, 22.2\% of verses are abstained, underscoring the analytical importance of uncertainty. We further report sensitivity analysis under confidence thresholding, selection-bias diagnostics that treat abstention as a category, and a distant-to-close workflow that retrieves verse-level exemplars along Eigenmood axes. The resulting framework supports scalable, auditable digital-humanities analysis while preserving interpretive caution by propagating uncertainty from verse-level evidence to poet-level inference.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Locality in Scalable MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenged by the curse of dimensionality. A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^\pi$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($\Pi(\pi)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $\Pi(\pi)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $\rho(E^{\mathrm{s}}+E^{\mathrm{a}}\Pi(\pi)) &lt; 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius.</description>

      <title>Early-Warning Signals of Grokking via Loss-Landscape Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization after prolonged training -- has been linked to confinement on low-dimensional execution manifolds in modular arithmetic. Whether this mechanism extends beyond arithmetic remains open. We study two sequence-learning benchmarks: SCAN compositional generalization and Dyck-1 depth prediction. Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding. These results identify the commutator defect as a robust, architecture-agnostic, causally implicated early-warning signal for delayed generalization in transformers.</description>

      <title>DDiT: Dynamic Patch Scheduling for Efficient Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image and video generation, but their success comes at the cost of heavy computation. This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: it achieves up to $3.52\times$ and $3.2\times$ speedup on FLUX-1.Dev and Wan $2.1$, respectively, without compromising the generation quality and prompt adherence.</description>

      <title>Exploring LLMs for User Story Extraction from Mockups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User stories are one of the most widely used artifacts in the software industry to define functional requirements. In parallel, the use of high-fidelity mockups facilitates end-user participation in defining their needs. In this work, we explore how combining these techniques with large language models (LLMs) enables agile and automated generation of user stories from mockups. To this end, we present a case study that analyzes the ability of LLMs to extract user stories from high-fidelity mockups, both with and without the inclusion of a glossary of the Language Extended Lexicon (LEL) in the prompts. Our results demonstrate that incorporating the LEL significantly enhances the accuracy and suitability of the generated user stories. This approach represents a step forward in the integration of AI into requirements engineering, with the potential to improve communication between users and developers.</description>

      <title>Persona2Web: Benchmarking Personalized Web Agents for Contextual Reasoning with User History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have advanced web agents, yet current agents lack personalization capabilities. Since users rarely specify every detail of their intent, practical web agents must be able to interpret ambiguous queries by inferring user preferences and contexts. To address this challenge, we present Persona2Web, the first benchmark for evaluating personalized web agents on the real open web, built upon the clarify-to-personalize principle, which requires agents to resolve ambiguity based on user history rather than relying on explicit instructions. Persona2Web consists of: (1) user histories that reveal preferences implicitly over long time spans, (2) ambiguous queries that require agents to infer implicit user preferences, and (3) a reasoning-aware evaluation framework that enables fine-grained assessment of personalization. We conduct extensive experiments across various agent architectures, backbone models, history access schemes, and queries with varying ambiguity levels, revealing key challenges in personalized web agent behavior. For reproducibility, our codes and datasets are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Persona2Web-73E8.</description>

      <title>ReIn: Conversational Error Recovery with Reasoning Inception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with tool integration achieve strong performance on fixed task-oriented dialogue datasets but remain vulnerable to unanticipated, user-induced errors. Rather than focusing on error prevention, this work focuses on error recovery, which necessitates the accurate diagnosis of erroneous dialogue contexts and execution of proper recovery plans. Under realistic constraints precluding model fine-tuning or prompt modification due to significant cost and time requirements, we explore whether agents can recover from contextually flawed interactions and how their behavior can be adapted without altering model parameters and prompts. To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans, which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception modules, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method. In-depth analysis of its operational mechanism, particularly in relation to instruction hierarchy, indicates that jointly defining recovery tools with ReIn can serve as a safe and effective strategy for improving the resilience of conversational agents without modifying the backbone models or system prompts.</description>

      <title>Transforming Behavioral Neuroscience Discovery with In-Context Learning and AI-Enhanced Tensor Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery pipelines typically involve complex, rigid, and time-consuming processes, from data preparation to analyzing and interpreting findings. Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of "In-Context Learning" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts. Finally, we demonstrate effective discovery, with results validated by the domain experts in the team.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Anomaly Precursors via Uncertainty-Aware Time-Series Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time-series data is critical in domains such as industrial operations, finance, and cybersecurity, where early identification of abnormal patterns is essential for ensuring system reliability and enabling preventive maintenance. However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments.</description>

      <title>Wink: Recovering from Misbehaviors in Coding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous coding agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being adopted in the software industry to automate complex engineering tasks. However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories.
  To address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session. We present our experience designing and deploying this system, offering insights into the challenges of building resilient agentic systems at scale.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Cross-Lingual Classification Approaches Enabling Topic Discovery for Multilingual Social Media Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysing multilingual social media discourse remains a major challenge in natural language processing, particularly when large-scale public debates span across diverse languages. This study investigates how different approaches for cross-lingual text classification can support reliable analysis of global conversations. Using hydrogen energy as a case study, we analyse a decade-long dataset of over nine million tweets in English, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean (2013--2022) for topic discovery. The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training. Each approach is evaluated for its ability to filter hydrogen-related tweets from noisy keyword-based collections. Subsequently, topic modeling is performed to extract dominant themes within the relevant subsets. The results highlight key trade-offs between translation and multilingual approaches, offering actionable insights into optimising cross-lingual pipelines for large-scale social media analysis.</description>

      <title>ALPS: A Diagnostic Challenge Set for Arabic Linguistic &amp; Pragmatic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent Arabic NLP benchmarks focus on scale, they often rely on synthetic or translated data which may benefit from deeper linguistic verification. We introduce ALPS (Arabic Linguistic &amp; Pragmatic Suite), a native, expert-curated diagnostic challenge set probing Deep Semantics and Pragmatics, capabilities that complement specialized large-scale benchmarks. While broad-coverage benchmarks prioritize scale and multi-task coverage, ALPS targets the depth of linguistic understanding through 531 rigorously crafted questions across 15 tasks and 47 subtasks. We developed the dataset with deep expertise in Arabic linguistics, guaranteeing cultural authenticity and eliminating translation artifacts. Evaluating 23 diverse models (commercial, open-source, and Arabic-native) against a single-pass human performance (avg. 84.6% accuracy) and an expert-adjudicated oracle (99.2%), we reveal a critical dissociation: models achieve high fluency but fail on fundamental morpho-syntactic dependencies, with elevated error rates on morpho-syntactic dependencies (36.5% across diacritics-reliant tasks) compared to compositional semantics. While top commercial models (Gemini-3-flash at 94.2%) surpass the average single human, a substantial gap persists between commercial giants and Arabic-native models, with the best Arabic-specific model (Jais-2-70B at 83.6%) approaching but not matching human performance.</description>

      <title>Sign Lock-In: Randomly Initialized Weight Signs Persist and Bottleneck Sub-Bit Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-bit model compression seeks storage below one bit per weight; as magnitudes are aggressively compressed, the sign bit becomes a fixed-cost bottleneck. Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity.</description>

      <title>General sample size analysis for probabilities of causation: a delta method approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilities of causation (PoCs), such as the probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS), are important tools for decision making but are generally not point identifiable. Existing work has derived bounds for these quantities using combinations of experimental and observational data. However, there is very limited research on sample size analysis, namely, how many experimental and observational samples are required to achieve a desired margin of error. In this paper, we propose a general sample size framework based on the delta method. Our approach applies to settings in which the target bounds of PoCs can be expressed as finite minima or maxima of linear combinations of experimental and observational probabilities. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed sample size calculations lead to stable estimation of these bounds.</description>

      <title>AdvSynGNN: Structure-Adaptive Graph Neural Nets via Adversarial Synthesis and Self-Corrective Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks frequently encounter significant performance degradation when confronted with structural noise or non-homophilous topologies. To address these systemic vulnerabilities, we present AdvSynGNN, a comprehensive architecture designed for resilient node-level representation learning. The proposed framework orchestrates multi-resolution structural synthesis alongside contrastive objectives to establish geometry-sensitive initializations. We develop a transformer backbone that adaptively accommodates heterophily by modulating attention mechanisms through learned topological signals. Central to our contribution is an integrated adversarial propagation engine, where a generative component identifies potential connectivity alterations while a discriminator enforces global coherence. Furthermore, label refinement is achieved through a residual correction scheme guided by per-node confidence metrics, which facilitates precise control over iterative stability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this synergistic approach effectively optimizes predictive accuracy across diverse graph distributions while maintaining computational efficiency. The study concludes with practical implementation protocols to ensure the robust deployment of the AdvSynGNN system in large-scale environments.</description>

      <title>FLoRG: Federated Fine-tuning with Low-rank Gram Matrices and Procrustes Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enable large language models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream tasks efficiently. Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\times$.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Portfolio Allocation: A Comparative Study with Mean-Variance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio Management is the process of overseeing a group of investments, referred to as a portfolio, with the objective of achieving predetermined investment goals. Portfolio optimization is a key component that involves allocating the portfolio assets so as to maximize returns while minimizing risk taken. It is typically carried out by financial professionals who use a combination of quantitative techniques and investment expertise to make decisions about the portfolio allocation.
  Recent applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have shown promising results when used to optimize portfolio allocation by training model-free agents on historical market data. Many of these methods compare their results against basic benchmarks or other state-of-the-art DRL agents but often fail to compare their performance against traditional methods used by financial professionals in practical settings. One of the most commonly used methods for this task is Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (MVO), which uses historical time series information to estimate expected asset returns and covariances, which are then used to optimize for an investment objective.
  Our work is a thorough comparison between model-free DRL and MVO for optimal portfolio allocation. We detail the specifics of how to make DRL for portfolio optimization work in practice, also noting the adjustments needed for MVO. Backtest results demonstrate strong performance of the DRL agent across many metrics, including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdowns, and absolute returns.</description>

      <title>TIFO: Time-Invariant Frequency Operator for Stationarity-Aware Representation Learning in Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonstationary time series forecasting suffers from the distribution shift issue due to the different distributions that produce the training and test data. Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset. In addition, TIFO reduces computational costs by 60% -70% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating strong scalability across diverse forecasting models.</description>

      <title>3D Scene Rendering with Multimodal Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and rendering are core tasks in computer vision, with applications spanning industrial monitoring, robotics, and autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy.</description>

      <title>VP-VAE: Rethinking Vector Quantization via Adaptive Vector Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental to modern generative modeling, yet they often suffer from training instability and "codebook collapse" due to the inherent coupling of representation learning and discrete codebook optimization. In this paper, we propose VP-VAE (Vector Perturbation VAE), a novel paradigm that decouples representation learning from discretization by eliminating the need for an explicit codebook during training. Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers. Extensive experiments on image and audio benchmarks demonstrate that VP-VAE and FSP improve reconstruction fidelity and achieve substantially more balanced token usage, while avoiding the instability inherent to coupled codebook training.</description>

      <title>TimeOmni-VL: Unified Models for Time Series Understanding and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent time series modeling faces a sharp divide between numerical generation and semantic understanding, with research showing that generation models often rely on superficial pattern matching, while understanding-oriented models struggle with high-fidelity numerical output. Although unified multimodal models (UMMs) have bridged this gap in vision, their potential for time series remains untapped. We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation. Experiments confirm that this unified approach significantly improves both semantic understanding and numerical precision, establishing a new frontier for multimodal time series modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that transformers and linear attention models can perform in-context learning (ICL) on simple function classes, such as linear regression. In this paper, we empirically study how these two attention mechanisms differ in their ICL behavior on the canonical linear-regression task of Garg et al. We evaluate learning quality (MSE), convergence, and generalization behavior of each architecture. We also analyze how increasing model depth affects ICL performance. Our results illustrate both the similarities and limitations of linear attention relative to quadratic attention in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust control of mechanical systems with multiple uncertainties remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when nonlinear dynamics and operating-condition variations are intricately intertwined. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer.</description>

      <title>Universal Fine-Grained Symmetry Inference and Enforcement for Rigorous Crystal Structure Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP), which aims to predict the three-dimensional atomic arrangement of a crystal from its composition, is central to materials discovery and mechanistic understanding. Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry. By integrating this symmetry-consistent template into a diffusion backbone, our approach constrains the stochastic generative trajectory to a physically valid geometric manifold. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks, alongside superior matching performance, thereby establishing a new paradigm for the rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space. This framework enables efficient expansion into previously uncharted materials space, eliminating reliance on existing databases or a priori structural knowledge.</description>

      <title>Robustness and Reasoning Fidelity of Large Language Models in Long-Context Code Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly assist software engineering tasks that require reasoning over long code contexts, yet their robustness under varying input conditions remains unclear. We conduct a systematic study of long-context code question answering using controlled ablations that test sensitivity to answer format, distractors, and context scale. Extending LongCodeBench Python dataset with new COBOL and Java question-answer sets, we evaluate state-of-the-art models under three settings: (i) shuffled multiple-choice options, (ii) open-ended questions and (iii) needle-in-a-haystack contexts containing relevant and adversarially irrelevant information. Results show substantial performance drops in both shuffled multiple-choice options and open-ended questions, and brittle behavior in the presence of irrelevant cues. Our findings highlight limitations of current long-context evaluations and provide a broader benchmark for assessing code reasoning in both legacy and modern systems.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Model-powered conversational agents (CAs) are increasingly capable of projecting sophisticated personalities through language, but how these projections affect users is unclear. We thus examine how CA personalities expressed linguistically affect user decisions and perceptions in the context of charitable giving. In a crowdsourced study, 360 participants interacted with one of eight CAs, each projecting a personality composed of three linguistic aspects: attitude (optimistic/pessimistic), authority (authoritative/submissive), and reasoning (emotional/rational). While the CA's composite personality did not affect participants' decisions, it did affect their perceptions and emotional responses. Particularly, participants interacting with pessimistic CAs felt lower emotional state and lower affinity towards the cause, perceived the CA as less trustworthy and less competent, and yet tended to donate more toward the charity. Perceptions of trust, competence, and situational empathy significantly predicted donation decisions. Our findings emphasize the risks CAs pose as instruments of manipulation, subtly influencing user perceptions and decisions.</description>

      <title>Deeper detection limits in astronomical imaging using self-supervised spatiotemporal denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection limit of astronomical imaging observations is limited by several noise sources. Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift &gt; 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods.</description>

      <title>Extending quantum theory with AI-assisted deterministic game theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an AI-assisted framework for predicting individual runs of complex quantum experiments, including contextuality and causality (adaptive measurements), within our long-term programme of discovering a local hidden-variable theory that extends quantum theory. In order to circumvent impossibility theorems, we replace the assumption of free choice (measurement independence and parameter independence) with a weaker, compatibilistic version called contingent free choice.
  Our framework is based on interpreting complex quantum experiments as a Chess-like game between observers and the universe, which is seen as an economic agent minimizing action. The game structures corresponding to generic experiments such as fixed-causal-order process matrices or causal contextuality scenarios, together with a deterministic non-Nashian resolution algorithm that abandons unilateral deviation assumptions (free choice) and assumes Perfect Prediction instead, were described in previous work.
  In this new research, we learn the reward functions of the game, which contain a hidden variable, using neural networks. The cost function is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the frequency histograms obtained through many deterministic runs of the game and the predictions of the extended Born rule.
  Using our framework on the specific case of the EPR 2-2-2 experiment acts as a proof-of-concept and a toy local-realist hidden-variable model that non-Nashian quantum theory is a promising avenue towards a local hidden-variable theory. Our framework constitutes a solid foundation, which can be further expanded in order to fully discover a complete quantum theory.</description>

      <title>TAPO-Structured Description Logic for Information Behavior: Procedural and Oracle-Based Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{TAPO-Structured Description Logic} (TAPO--DL), a formal extension of classical description logic designed to model \emph{information behavior} as a structured, dynamic process.
  TAPO--DL extends the standard T--Box/A--Box architecture with two additional layers: a \emph{Procedural Box} (P--Box), which supports concept-driven, imperative-style programs such as conditional and iterative actions, and an \emph{Oracle Box} (O--Box), which formalizes controlled interaction with external information sources. While the terminological and assertional components capture static conceptual and factual knowledge, the procedural and oracle-based components enable the explicit representation of information-generating actions and external validation.
  We provide a unified semantic framework for TAPO--DL based on a co-generative, sheaf-theoretic interpretation, in which local informational states are modeled as sections and informational stability corresponds to the existence of coherent global structures. Within this setting, informational truth is characterized as stability under repeated agentive interaction rather than correspondence to a fixed global state.
  By integrating description logic with procedural dynamics, oracle-based reasoning, and sheaf-theoretic semantics, TAPO--DL offers a principled formal framework for analyzing information behavior in contexts involving interaction, uncertainty, and contextuality.</description>

      <title>Federated Latent Space Alignment for Multi-user Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning for effective task execution, but differing latent representations in AI-native devices can cause semantic mismatches that hinder mutual understanding. This paper introduces a novel approach to mitigating latent space misalignment in multi-agent AI- native semantic communications. In a downlink scenario, we consider an access point (AP) communicating with multiple users to accomplish a specific AI-driven task. Our method implements a protocol that shares a semantic pre-equalizer at the AP and local semantic equalizers at user devices, fostering mutual understanding and task-oriented communication while considering power and complexity constraints. To achieve this, we employ a federated optimization for the decentralized training of the semantic equalizers at the AP and user sides. Numerical results validate the proposed approach in goal-oriented semantic communication, revealing key trade-offs among accuracy, com- munication overhead, complexity, and the semantic proximity of AI-native communication devices.</description>

      <title>Towards Cross-lingual Values Assessment: A Consensus-Pluralism Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have become pivotal to content safety, current evaluation paradigms primarily focus on detecting explicit harms (e.g., violence or hate speech), neglecting the subtler value dimensions conveyed in digital content. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Value, a novel Cross-lingual Values Assessment Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess deep-level values of content from a global perspective. X-Value consists of more than 5,000 QA pairs across 18 languages, systematically organized into 7 core domains grounded in Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values and categorized into easy and hard levels for discriminative evaluation. We further propose a unique two-stage annotation framework that first identifies whether an issue falls under global consensus (e.g., human rights) or pluralism (e.g., religion), and subsequently conducts a multi-party evaluation of the latent values embedded within the content. Systematic evaluations on X-Value reveal that current SOTA LLMs exhibit deficiencies in cross-lingual values assessment ($Acc &lt; 77\%$), with significant performance disparities across different languages ($\Delta Acc &gt; 20\%$). This work highlights the urgent need to improve the nuanced, values-aware content assessment capability of LLMs. Our X-Value is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Whitolf/X-Value.</description>

      <title>Flickering Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Flickering Multi-Armed Bandits (FMAB), a new MAB framework where the set of available arms (or actions) can change at each round, and the available set at any time may depend on the agent's previously selected arm. We model this constrained, evolving availability using random graph processes, where arms are nodes and the agent's movement is restricted to its local neighborhood. We analyze this problem under two random graph models: an i.i.d. Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) process and an Edge-Markovian process. We propose and analyze a two-phase algorithm that employs a lazy random walk for exploration to efficiently identify the optimal arm, followed by a navigation and commitment phase for exploitation. We establish high-probability and expected sublinear regret bounds for both graph settings. We show that the exploration cost of our algorithm is near-optimal by establishing a matching information-theoretic lower bound for this problem class, highlighting the fundamental cost of exploration under local-move constraints. We complement our theoretical guarantees with numerical simulations, including a scenario of a robotic ground vehicle scouting a disaster-affected region.</description>

      <title>Same Meaning, Different Scores: Lexical and Syntactic Sensitivity in LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established standardized evaluation benchmarks as the primary instrument for model comparison. Yet, their reliability is increasingly questioned due to sensitivity to shallow variations in input prompts. This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation.</description>

      <title>WebFAQ 2.0: A Multilingual QA Dataset with Mined Hard Negatives for Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce WebFAQ 2.0, a new version of the WebFAQ dataset, containing 198 million FAQ-based natural question-answer pairs across 108 languages. Compared to the previous version, it significantly expands multilingual coverage and the number of bilingual aligned QA pairs to over 14.3M, making it the largest FAQ-based resource. Unlike the original release, WebFAQ 2.0 uses a novel data collection strategy that directly crawls and extracts relevant web content, resulting in a substantially more diverse and multilingual dataset with richer context through page titles and descriptions. In response to community feedback, we also release a hard negatives dataset for training dense retrievers, with 1.25M queries across 20 languages. These hard negatives were mined using a two-stage retrieval pipeline and include cross-encoder scores for 200 negatives per query. We further show how this resource enables two primary fine-tuning strategies for dense retrievers: Contrastive Learning with MultipleNegativesRanking loss, and Knowledge Distillation with MarginMSE loss. WebFAQ 2.0 is not a static resource but part of a long-term effort. Since late 2025, structured FAQs are being regularly released through the Open Web Index, enabling continuous expansion and refinement. We publish the datasets and training scripts to facilitate further research in multilingual and cross-lingual IR. The dataset itself and all related resources are publicly available on GitHub and HuggingFace.</description>

      <title>SubQuad: Near-Quadratic-Free Structure Inference with Distribution-Balanced Objectives in Adaptive Receptor framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparative analysis of adaptive immune repertoires at population scale is hampered by two practical bottlenecks: the near-quadratic cost of pairwise affinity evaluations and dataset imbalances that obscure clinically important minority clonotypes. We introduce SubQuad, an end-to-end pipeline that addresses these challenges by combining antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval with GPU-accelerated affinity kernels, learned multimodal fusion, and fairness-constrained clustering. The system employs compact MinHash prefiltering to sharply reduce candidate comparisons, a differentiable gating module that adaptively weights complementary alignment and embedding channels on a per-pair basis, and an automated calibration routine that enforces proportional representation of rare antigen-specific subgroups. On large viral and tumor repertoires SubQuad achieves measured gains in throughput and peak memory usage while preserving or improving recall@k, cluster purity, and subgroup equity. By co-designing indexing, similarity fusion, and equity-aware objectives, SubQuad offers a scalable, bias-aware platform for repertoire mining and downstream translational tasks such as vaccine target prioritization and biomarker discovery.</description>

      <title>From Subtle to Significant: Prompt-Driven Self-Improving Optimization in Test-Time Graph OOD Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify whether a test graph deviates from the distribution of graphs observed during training, which is critical for ensuring the reliability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) when deployed in open-world scenarios. Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{I}mproving \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}ut-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and outperformance of our SIGOOD method. The code is at https://github.com/Ee1s/SIGOOD.</description>

      <title>What Breaks Embodied AI Security:LLM Vulnerabilities, CPS Flaws,or Something Else?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied AI systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, service robots, and LLM-driven interactive agents) are rapidly transitioning from controlled environments to safety critical real-world deployments. Unlike disembodied AI, failures in embodied intelligence lead to irreversible physical consequences, raising fundamental questions about security, safety, and reliability. While existing research predominantly analyzes embodied AI through the lenses of Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities or classical Cyber-Physical System (CPS) failures, this survey argues that these perspectives are individually insufficient to explain many observed breakdowns in modern embodied systems. We posit that a significant class of failures arises from embodiment-induced system-level mismatches, rather than from isolated model flaws or traditional CPS attacks. Specifically, we identify four core insights that explain why embodied AI is fundamentally harder to secure: (i) semantic correctness does not imply physical safety, as language-level reasoning abstracts away geometry, dynamics, and contact constraints; (ii) identical actions can lead to drastically different outcomes across physical states due to nonlinear dynamics and state uncertainty; (iii) small errors propagate and amplify across tightly coupled perception-decision-action loops; and (iv) safety is not compositional across time or system layers, enabling locally safe decisions to accumulate into globally unsafe behavior. These insights suggest that securing embodied AI requires moving beyond component-level defenses toward system-level reasoning about physical risk, uncertainty, and failure propagation.</description>

      <title>A feature-stable and explainable machine learning framework for trustworthy decision-making under incomplete clinical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly applied to biomedical data, yet their adoption in high stakes domains remains limited by poor robustness, limited interpretability, and instability of learned features under realistic data perturbations, such as missingness. In particular, models that achieve high predictive performance may still fail to inspire trust if their key features fluctuate when data completeness changes, undermining reproducibility and downstream decision-making. Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data. By explicitly quantifying robustness to missing data and prioritising interpretable, stable features, CACTUS offers a generalizable framework for trustworthy data-driven decision support.</description>

      <title>Voice-Driven Semantic Perception for UAV-Assisted Emergency Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted networks are increasingly foreseen as a promising approach for emergency response, providing rapid, flexible, and resilient communications in environments where terrestrial infrastructure is degraded or unavailable. In such scenarios, voice radio communications remain essential for first responders due to their robustness; however, their unstructured nature prevents direct integration with automated UAV-assisted network management. This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors. These findings establish the feasibility of voice-driven situational awareness for UAV-assisted networks and show a practical foundation for human-in-the-loop decision support and adaptive network management in emergency response operations.</description>

      <title>SpectralGCD: Spectral Concept Selection and Cross-modal Representation Learning for Generalized Category Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify novel categories in unlabeled data while leveraging a small labeled subset of known classes. Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/miccunifi/SpectralGCD.</description>

      <title>A High-Level Survey of Optical Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant advances in computer vision have also propelled progress in remote sensing. Concurrently, the use of drones has expanded, with many organizations incorporating them into their operations. Most drones are equipped by default with RGB cameras, which are both robust and among the easiest sensors to use and interpret. The body of literature on optical remote sensing is vast, encompassing diverse tasks, capabilities, and methodologies. Each task or methodology could warrant a dedicated survey. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of the field, while also presenting key information, such as datasets and insights. It aims to serve as a guide for researchers entering the field, offering high-level insights and helping them focus on areas most relevant to their interests. To the best of our knowledge, no existing survey addresses this holistic perspective.</description>

      <title>Improving LLM-based Recommendation with Self-Hard Negatives from Intermediate Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in recommender systems, where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly used for adaptation. Subsequent studies further introduce preference learning to incorporate negative samples into the training process. However, existing methods rely on sequence-level, offline-generated negatives, making them less discriminative and informative when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks with large negative item spaces. To address these challenges, we propose ILRec, a novel preference fine-tuning framework for LLM-based recommendation, leveraging self-hard negative signals extracted from intermediate layers to improve preference learning. Specifically, we identify self-hard negative tokens from intermediate layers as fine-grained negative supervision that dynamically reflects the model's preference learning process. To effectively integrate these signals into training, we design a two-stage framework comprising cross-layer preference optimization and cross-layer preference distillation, enabling the model to jointly discriminate informative negatives and enhance the quality of negative signals from intermediate layers. In addition, we introduce a lightweight collaborative filtering model to assign token-level rewards for negative signals, mitigating the risk of over-penalizing false negatives. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate ILRec's effectiveness in enhancing the performance of LLM-based recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Two-Layer Neural Networks under Gaussian Input Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence guarantee of two-layer neural network training with Gaussian randomly masked inputs. This scenario corresponds to Gaussian dropout at the input level, or noisy input training common in sensor networks, privacy-preserving training, and federated learning, where each user may have access to partial or corrupted features. Using a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we demonstrate that training a two-layer ReLU network with Gaussian randomly masked inputs achieves linear convergence up to an error region proportional to the mask's variance. A key technical contribution is resolving the randomness within the non-linear activation, a problem of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification for Long-Form Language Model Outputs: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has emerged as an effective approach to closed-book hallucination detection for LLMs, but existing methods are largely designed for short-form outputs and do not generalize well to long-form generation. We introduce a taxonomy for fine-grained uncertainty quantification in long-form LLM outputs that distinguishes methods by design choices at three stages: response decomposition, unit-level scoring, and response-level aggregation. We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs. Our framework clarifies relationships between prior methods, enables apples-to-apples comparisons, and provides practical guidance for selecting components for fine-grained UQ.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pipelines: A Fundamental Study on the Rise of Generative-Retrieval Architectures in Web Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Web research and practices have evolved significantly over time, offering users diverse and accessible solutions across a wide range of tasks. While advanced concepts such as Web 4.0 have emerged from mature technologies, the introduction of large language models (LLMs) has profoundly influenced both the field and its applications. This wave of LLMs has permeated science and technology so deeply that no area remains untouched. Consequently, LLMs are reshaping web research and development, transforming traditional pipelines into generative solutions for tasks like information retrieval, question answering, recommendation systems, and web analytics. They have also enabled new applications such as web-based summarization and educational tools. This survey explores recent advances in the impact of LLMs-particularly through the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-on web research and industry. It discusses key developments, open challenges, and future directions for enhancing web solutions with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Jolt Atlas: Verifiable Inference via Lookup Arguments in Zero Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Jolt Atlas, a zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) framework that extends the Jolt proving system to model inference. Unlike zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), which emulate CPU instruction execution, Jolt Atlas adapts Jolt's lookup-centric approach and applies it directly to ONNX tensor operations. The ONNX computational model eliminates the need for CPU registers and simplifies memory consistency verification. In addition, ONNX is an open-source, portable format, which makes it easy to share and deploy models across different frameworks, hardware platforms, and runtime environments without requiring framework-specific conversions.
  Our lookup arguments, which use sumcheck protocol, are well-suited for non-linear functions -- key building blocks in modern ML. We apply optimisations such as neural teleportation to reduce the size of lookup tables while preserving model accuracy, as well as several tensor-level verification optimisations detailed in this paper. We demonstrate that Jolt Atlas can prove model inference in memory-constrained environments -- a prover property commonly referred to as \textit{streaming}. Furthermore, we discuss how Jolt Atlas achieves zero-knowledge through the BlindFold technique, as introduced in Vega. In contrast to existing zkML frameworks, we show practical proving times for classification, embedding, automated reasoning, and small language models.
  Jolt Atlas enables cryptographic verification that can be run on-device, without specialised hardware. The resulting proofs are succinctly verifiable. This makes Jolt Atlas well-suited for privacy-centric and adversarial environments. In a companion work, we outline various use cases of Jolt Atlas, including how it serves as guardrails in agentic commerce and for trustless AI context (often referred to as \textit{AI memory}).</description>

      <title>What Do LLMs Associate with Your Name? A Human-Centered Black-Box Audit of Personal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), and conversational agents based on them, are exposed to personal data (PD) during pre-training and during user interactions. Prior work shows that PD can resurface, yet users lack insight into how strongly models associate specific information to their identity. We audit PD across eight LLMs (3 open-source; 5 API-based, including GPT-4o), introduce LMP2 (Language Model Privacy Probe), a human-centered, privacy-preserving audit tool refined through two formative studies (N=20), and run two studies with EU residents to capture (i) intuitions about LLM-generated PD (N1=155) and (ii) reactions to tool output (N2=303). We show empirically that models confidently generate multiple PD categories for well-known individuals. For everyday users, GPT-4o generates 11 features with 60% or more accuracy (e.g., gender, hair color, languages). Finally, 72% of participants sought control over model-generated associations with their name, raising questions about what counts as PD and whether data privacy rights should extend to LLMs.</description>

      <title>Tracing Copied Pixels and Regularizing Patch Affinity in Copy Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Copy Detection (ICD) aims to identify manipulated content between image pairs through robust feature representation learning. While self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced ICD systems, existing view-level contrastive methods struggle with sophisticated edits due to insufficient fine-grained correspondence learning. We address this limitation by exploiting the inherent geometric traceability in edited content through two key innovations. First, we propose PixTrace - a pixel coordinate tracking module that maintains explicit spatial mappings across editing transformations. Second, we introduce CopyNCE, a geometrically-guided contrastive loss that regularizes patch affinity using overlap ratios derived from PixTrace's verified mappings. Our method bridges pixel-level traceability with patch-level similarity learning, suppressing supervision noise in SSL training. Extensive experiments demonstrate not only state-of-the-art performance (88.7% uAP / 83.9% RP90 for matcher, 72.6% uAP / 68.4% RP90 for descriptor on DISC21 dataset) but also better interpretability over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Learning with Boolean threshold functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method for training neural networks on Boolean data in which the values at all nodes are strictly $\pm 1$, and the resulting models are typically equivalent to networks whose nonzero weights are also $\pm 1$. The method replaces loss minimization with a nonconvex constraint formulation. Each node implements a Boolean threshold function (BTF), and training is expressed through a divide-and-concur decomposition into two complementary constraints: one enforces local BTF consistency between inputs, weights, and output; the other imposes architectural concurrence, equating neuron outputs with downstream inputs and enforcing weight equality across training-data instantiations of the network. The reflect-reflect-relax (RRR) projection algorithm is used to reconcile these constraints.
  Each BTF constraint includes a lower bound on the margin. When this bound is sufficiently large, the learned representations are provably sparse and equivalent to networks composed of simple logical gates with $\pm 1$ weights. Across a range of tasks -- including multiplier-circuit discovery, binary autoencoding, logic-network inference, and cellular automata learning -- the method achieves exact solutions or strong generalization in regimes where standard gradient-based methods struggle. These results demonstrate that projection-based constraint satisfaction provides a viable and conceptually distinct foundation for learning in discrete neural systems, with implications for interpretability and efficient inference.</description>

      <title>LORA-CRAFT: Cross-layer Rank Adaptation via Frozen Tucker Decomposition of Pre-trained Attention Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CRAFT (Cross-layer Rank Adaptation via Frozen Tucker), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that applies Tucker tensor decomposition to pre-trained attention weight matrices stacked across transformer layers and trains only small square adaptation matrices on the resulting frozen Tucker factors. Existing tensor-based PEFT methods decompose gradient updates: LoTR applies Tucker decomposition with shared factor matrices, while SuperLoRA groups and reshapes $\Delta W$ across layers before applying Tucker decomposition. Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large demonstrate that CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters--a count independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks.</description>

      <title>The Anxiety of Influence: Bloom Filters in Transformer Attention Heads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some transformer attention heads appear to function as membership testers, dedicating themselves to answering the question "has this token appeared before in the context?" We identify these heads across four language models (GPT-2 small, medium, and large; Pythia-160M) and show that they form a spectrum of membership-testing strategies. Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.</description>

      <title>Position: Evaluation of ECG Representations Must Be Fixed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This position paper argues that current benchmarking practice in 12-lead ECG representation learning must be fixed to ensure progress is reliable and aligned with clinically meaningful objectives. The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting.</description>

      <title>Systematic Evaluation of Single-Cell Foundation Model Interpretability Reveals Attention Captures Co-Expression Rather Than Unique Regulatory Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation framework - thirty-seven analyses, 153 statistical tests, four cell types, two perturbation modalities - for assessing mechanistic interpretability in single-cell foundation models. Applying this framework to scGPT and Geneformer, we find that attention patterns encode structured biological information with layer-specific organisation - protein-protein interactions in early layers, transcriptional regulation in late layers - but this structure provides no incremental value for perturbation prediction: trivial gene-level baselines outperform both attention and correlation edges (AUROC 0.81-0.88 versus 0.70), pairwise edge scores add zero predictive contribution, and causal ablation of regulatory heads produces no degradation. These findings generalise from K562 to RPE1 cells; the attention-correlation relationship is context-dependent, but gene-level dominance is universal. Cell-State Stratified Interpretability (CSSI) addresses an attention-specific scaling failure, improving GRN recovery up to 1.85x. The framework establishes reusable quality-control standards for the field.</description>

      <title>Toward a Fully Autonomous, AI-Native Particle Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This position paper presents a vision for self-driving particle accelerators that operate autonomously with minimal human intervention. We propose that future facilities be designed through artificial intelligence (AI) co-design, where AI jointly optimizes the accelerator lattice, diagnostics, and science application from inception to maximize performance while enabling autonomous operation. Rather than retrofitting AI onto human-centric systems, we envision facilities designed from the ground up as AI-native platforms. We outline nine critical research thrusts spanning agentic control architectures, knowledge integration, adaptive learning, digital twins, health monitoring, safety frameworks, modular hardware design, multimodal data fusion, and cross-domain collaboration. This roadmap aims to guide the accelerator community toward a future where AI-driven design and operation deliver unprecedented science output and reliability.</description>

      <title>MASPO: Unifying Gradient Utilization, Probability Mass, and Signal Reliability for Robust and Sample-Efficient LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) algorithms, such as GRPO, rely on rigid, uniform, and symmetric trust region mechanisms that are fundamentally misaligned with the complex optimization dynamics of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in these methods: (1) inefficient gradient utilization caused by the binary cutoff of hard clipping, (2) insensitive probability mass arising from uniform ratio constraints that ignore the token distribution, and (3) asymmetric signal reliability stemming from the disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive and negative samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

      <title>Probability-Invariant Random Walk Learning on Gyral Folding-Based Cortical Similarity Networks for Alzheimer's and Lewy Body Dementia Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) present overlapping clinical features yet require distinct diagnostic strategies. While neuroimaging-based brain network analysis is promising, atlas-based representations may obscure individualized anatomy. Gyral folding-based networks using three-hinge gyri provide a biologically grounded alternative, but inter-individual variability in cortical folding results in inconsistent landmark correspondence and highly irregular network sizes, violating the fixed-topology and node-alignment assumptions of most existing graph learning methods, particularly in clinical datasets where pathological changes further amplify anatomical heterogeneity. We therefore propose a probability-invariant random-walk-based framework that classifies individualized gyral folding networks without explicit node alignment. Cortical similarity networks are built from local morphometric features and represented by distributions of anonymized random walks, with an anatomy-aware encoding that preserves permutation invariance. Experiments on a large clinical cohort of AD and LBD subjects show consistent improvements over existing gyral folding and atlas-based models, demonstrating robustness and potential for dementia diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Be Wary of Your Time Series Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalization and scaling are fundamental preprocessing steps in time series modeling, yet their role in Transformer-based models remains underexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>Conditional Flow Matching for Continuous Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving on a Manifold-Aware Spectral Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety validation for Level 4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) is currently bottlenecked by the inability to scale the detection of rare, high-risk long-tail scenarios using traditional rule-based heuristics. We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets.</description>

      <title>The Cascade Equivalence Hypothesis: When Do Speech LLMs Behave Like ASR$\rightarrow$LLM Pipelines?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current speech LLMs largely perform implicit ASR: on tasks solvable from a transcript, they are behaviorally and mechanistically equivalent to simple Whisper$\to$LLM cascades. We show this through matched-backbone testing across four speech LLMs and six tasks, controlling for the LLM backbone for the first time. Ultravox is statistically indistinguishable from its matched cascade ($\kappa{=}0.93$); logit lens reveals literal text emerging in hidden states; LEACE concept erasure confirms text representations are causally necessary in both architectures tested, collapsing accuracy to near-zero. Qwen2-Audio genuinely diverges, revealing cascade equivalence is architecture-dependent, not universal. For most deployed use cases, current speech LLMs are expensive cascades, and under noise, they are worse ones, with clean-condition advantages reversing by up to 7.6% at 0 dB.</description>

      <title>Adapting Actively on the Fly: Relevance-Guided Online Meta-Learning with Latent Concepts for Geospatial Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world settings, such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, or public health, with costly and difficult data collection and dynamic environments, strategically sampling from unobserved regions is essential for efficiently uncovering hidden targets under tight resource constraints. Yet, sparse and biased geospatial ground truth limits the applicability of existing learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning. To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments. Our experiments include testing on a real-world dataset of cancer-causing PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination, showcasing our method's reliability at uncovering targets with limited data and a varying environment.</description>

      <title>Towards Anytime-Valid Statistical Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient mechanisms to distinguish machine-generated content from human text. While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Stable Asynchrony: Variance-Controlled Off-Policy RL for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to improve large language models on reasoning tasks, and asynchronous RL training is attractive because it increases end-to-end throughput. However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, we find collapse is reliably predicted by effective sample size (ESS) and unstable gradient norms. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants. This reduces long-context, multi-turn training time by 2.5$\times$ while matching synchronous performance, demonstrating that explicit control of policy-gradient variance is key for reliable asynchronous RL at scale.</description>

      <title>SMAC: Score-Matched Actor-Critics for Robust Offline-to-Online Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods find performant actor-critics, however, fine-tuning these actor-critics online with value-based RL algorithms typically causes immediate drops in performance. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that, in the loss landscape, offline maxima for prior algorithms and online maxima are separated by low-performance valleys that gradient-based fine-tuning traverses. Following this, we present Score Matched Actor-Critic (SMAC), an offline RL method designed to learn actor-critics that transition to online value-based RL algorithms with no drop in performance. SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization. SMAC achieves smooth transfer to Soft Actor-Critic and TD3 in 6/6 D4RL tasks. In 4/6 environments, it reduces regret by 34-58% over the best baseline.</description>

      <title>When to Trust the Cheap Check: Weak and Strong Verification for Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning with LLMs increasingly unfolds inside a broader verification loop. Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.</description>

      <title>Reverso: Efficient Time Series Foundation Models for Zero-shot Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning time series foundation models has been shown to be a promising approach for zero-shot time series forecasting across diverse time series domains. Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.</description>

      <title>FAMOSE: A ReAct Approach to Automated Feature Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature engineering remains a critical yet challenging bottleneck in machine learning, particularly for tabular data, as identifying optimal features from an exponentially large feature space traditionally demands substantial domain expertise. To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Frontier of Black-Box LVLM Attacks via Fine-Grained Detail Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.</description>

      <title>Sink-Aware Pruning for Diffusion Language Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose ${\bf \texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute. Our code is available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Sink-Aware-Pruning.</description>

      <title>Goal Inference from Open-Ended Dialog</title>

Abstract: Embodied AI Agents are quickly becoming important and common tools in society. These embodied agents should be able to learn about and accomplish a wide range of user goals and preferences efficiently and robustly. Large Language Models (LLMs) are often used as they allow for opportunities for rich and open-ended dialog type interaction between the human and agent to accomplish tasks according to human preferences. In this thesis, we argue that for embodied agents that deal with open-ended dialog during task assistance: 1) AI Agents should extract goals from conversations in the form of Natural Language (NL) to be better at capturing human preferences as it is intuitive for humans to communicate their preferences on tasks to agents through natural language. 2) AI Agents should quantify/maintain uncertainty about these goals to ensure that actions are being taken according to goals that the agent is extremely certain about. We present an online method for embodied agents to learn and accomplish diverse user goals. While offline methods like RLHF can represent various goals but require large datasets, our approach achieves similar flexibility with online efficiency. We extract natural language goal representations from conversations with Large Language Models (LLMs). We prompt an LLM to role play as a human with different goals and use the corresponding likelihoods to run Bayesian inference over potential goals. As a result, our method can represent uncertainty over complex goals based on unrestricted dialog. We evaluate in a text-based grocery shopping domain and an AI2Thor robot simulation. We compare our method to ablation baselines that lack either explicit goal representation or probabilistic inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines whether collective reasoning among generative agents can facilitate novel and coherent thinking that leads to innovation. To achieve this, it proposes GAI, a new LLM-empowered framework designed for reflection and interaction among multiple generative agents to replicate the process of innovation. The core of the GAI framework lies in an architecture that dynamically processes the internal states of agents and a dialogue scheme specifically tailored to facilitate analogy-driven innovation. The framework's functionality is evaluated using Dyson's invention of the bladeless fan as a case study, assessing the extent to which the core ideas of the innovation can be replicated through a set of fictional technical documents. The experimental results demonstrate that models with internal states significantly outperformed those without, achieving higher average scores and lower variance. Notably, the model with five heterogeneous agents equipped with internal states successfully replicated the key ideas underlying the Dyson's invention. This indicates that the internal state enables agents to refine their ideas, resulting in the construction and sharing of more coherent and comprehensive concepts.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Decision Making with Human Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making. In many cases, despite the algorithm's superior performance, the final decision remains in human hands. For example, an AI may assist doctors in determining which diagnostic tests to run, but the doctor ultimately makes the diagnosis. This paper studies such AI-assisted decision-making settings, where the human learns through repeated interactions with the algorithm. In our framework, the algorithm -- designed to maximize decision accuracy according to its own model -- determines which features the human can consider. The human then makes a prediction based on their own less accurate model. We observe that the discrepancy between the algorithm's model and the human's model creates a fundamental tradeoff: Should the algorithm prioritize recommending more informative features, encouraging the human to learn their importance, even if it results in less accurate predictions in the short term until learning occurs? Or is it preferable to forgo educating the human and instead select features that align more closely with their existing understanding, minimizing the immediate cost of learning? Our analysis reveals how this trade-off is shaped by both the algorithm's patience (the time-discount rate of its objective over multiple periods) and the human's willingness and ability to learn. We show that optimal feature selection has a surprisingly clean combinatorial characterization, reducible to a stationary sequence of feature subsets that is tractable to compute. As the algorithm becomes more "patient" or the human's learning improves, the algorithm increasingly selects more informative features, enhancing both prediction accuracy and the human's understanding.</description>

      <title>Capturing Individual Human Preferences with Reward Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback usually models preferences using a reward function that does not distinguish between people. We argue that this is unlikely to be a good design choice in contexts with high potential for disagreement, like in the training of large language models. We formalise and analyse the problem of learning a reward model that can be specialised to a user. Using the principle of empirical risk minimisation, we derive a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound showing the dependency of the approximation error on the number of training examples, as usual, and also on the number of human raters who provided feedback on them. Based on our theoretical findings, we discuss how to best collect pairwise preference data and argue that adaptive reward models should be beneficial when there is considerable disagreement among users. We also propose a concrete architecture for an adaptive reward model. Our approach leverages the observation that individual preferences can be captured as a linear combination of a set of general reward features. We show how to learn such features and subsequently use them to quickly adapt the reward model to a specific individual, even if their preferences are not reflected in the training data. We present experiments with large language models illustrating our theoretical results and comparing the proposed architecture with a non-adaptive baseline. Consistent with our analysis, the benefits provided by our model increase with the number of raters and the heterogeneity of their preferences. We also show that our model compares favourably to adaptive counterparts, including those performing in-context personalisation.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Framework for Evaluating Health Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing complex datasets. Recent studies demonstrate their potential to generate useful, personalized responses when provided with patient-specific health information that encompasses lifestyle, biomarkers, and context. As LLM-driven health applications are increasingly adopted, rigorous and efficient one-sided evaluation methodologies are crucial to ensure response quality across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, personalization and safety. Current evaluation practices for open-ended text responses heavily rely on human experts. This approach introduces human factors and is often cost-prohibitive, labor-intensive, and hinders scalability, especially in complex domains like healthcare where response assessment necessitates domain expertise and considers multifaceted patient data. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Precise Boolean rubrics: an evaluation framework that streamlines human and automated evaluation of open-ended questions by identifying gaps in model responses using a minimal set of targeted rubrics questions. Our approach is based on recent work in more general evaluation settings that contrasts a smaller set of complex evaluation targets with a larger set of more precise, granular targets answerable with simple boolean responses. We validate this approach in metabolic health, a domain encompassing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Our results demonstrate that Adaptive Precise Boolean rubrics yield higher inter-rater agreement among expert and non-expert human evaluators, and in automated assessments, compared to traditional Likert scales, while requiring approximately half the evaluation time of Likert-based methods. This enhanced efficiency, particularly in automated evaluation and non-expert contributions, paves the way for more extensive and cost-effective evaluation of LLMs in health.</description>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) address two key challenges in applying deep learning to graph-structured data: they handle varying size input graphs and ensure invariance under graph isomorphism. While GNNs have demonstrated broad applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important question. In this paper, we propose GNN architectures that correspond precisely to prominent fragments of first-order logic (FO), including various modal logics as well as more expressive two-variable fragments. To establish these results, we apply methods from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning. Our results provide a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness of GNNs within FO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks that advances long-context understanding in embodied AI. $\infty$-THOR provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible, and unlimited long-horizon trajectories; (2) a novel embodied QA task, Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack, where multiple scattered clues across extended trajectories test agents' long-context reasoning ability; and (3) a long-horizon dataset and benchmark suite featuring complex tasks that span hundreds of environment steps, each paired with ground-truth action sequences. To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{SPECS}$: Faster Test-Time Scaling through Speculative Drafts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has driven the recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically by allocating additional computation for more thorough exploration. However, increased compute often comes at the expense of higher user-facing latency, directly impacting user experience. Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $\texttt{SPECS}$, a latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding. $\texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based deferral mechanism. Empirical results on MATH500, AMC23 and OlympiadBench datasets show that $\texttt{SPECS}$~matches or surpasses beam search accuracy while reducing latency by up to $\sim$19.1\%. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm converges to the solution of a KL-regularized reinforcement learning objective with increasing beam width.</description>

      <title>Sufficient, Necessary and Complete Causal Explanations in Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that frequently lack formal rigour. On the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal explanations and their equivalence to logic-based explanations. We demonstrate how to subdivide an image into its sufficient and necessary components. We introduce $\delta$-complete explanations, which have a minimum confidence threshold and 1-complete causal explanations, explanations that are classified with the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that different models have different patterns of sufficiency, necessity, and completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s per image on a ResNet model to compute all types of explanations, and are totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as monotonicity, of the model.</description>

      <title>Bongard-RWR+: Real-World Representations of Fine-Grained Concepts in Bongard Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Drones that Think on their Feet: Sudden Landing Decisions with Embodied AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms, faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete. Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models, provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand, advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Reactivity: Measuring Proactive Problem Solving in LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and expose promising future research directions.</description>

We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). Soft Symbolic Control constitutes a dedicated governance layer within SCL, applying symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference while preserving the flexibility of neural reasoning and restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.</description>

      <title>CaveAgent: Transforming LLMs into Stateful Runtime Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly capable of complex task execution, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by text-centric paradigms that struggle with long-horizon tasks due to fragile multi-turn dependencies and context drift. We present CaveAgent, a framework that shifts tool use from ``LLM-as-Text-Generator'' to ``LLM-as-Runtime-Operator.'' CaveAgent introduces a dual-stream architecture that inverts the conventional paradigm: rather than treating the LLM's text context as the primary workspace with tools as auxiliary, CaveAgent elevates the persistent Python runtime as the central locus of state, with a lightweight semantic stream serving as its orchestrator. Beyond leveraging code generation to resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, CaveAgent introduces \textit{Stateful Runtime Management}: it injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns, unlike existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound. CaveAgent further provides a runtime-integrated skill management system that extends the Agent Skills open standard, enabling ecosystem interoperability through executable skill injections. This persistence mechanism serves as a high-fidelity external memory that reduces context drift in multi-turn interactions and preserves processed data for downstream applications without information loss. Evaluations show consistent improvement across challenging benchmarks, enabling CaveAgent to handle data scales that cause context overflow in both JSON-based and code-based agents. The accessible runtime state further provides programmatically verifiable feedback, enabling automated evaluation and reward signal generation without human annotation and establishing a structural foundation for future research in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR).</description>

      <title>Puzzle it Out: Local-to-Global World Model for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.</description>

Abstract: Current business environments demand continuous reconfiguration of cross-functional processes, yet enterprise systems remain organized around siloed departments, rigid workflows, and hard-coded automation. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting natural language and unstructured data but lack deterministic and verifiable execution of complex business logic. We introduce Autonomous Business System (AUTOBUS), a system that combines LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic architecture for executing end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre- and post-conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is represented as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing semantic grounding for reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints and orchestrates actions. Humans define semantics and policies, curate tools, and oversee high-impact or ambiguous decisions. We present the AUTOBUS architecture and a case study that demonstrates accelerated time to market in a data-rich organization. A reference implementation of the case study is available at https://github.com/cecilpang/autobus-paper.</description>

      <title>Beyond In-Domain Detection: SpikeScore for Cross-Domain Hallucination Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19245v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs' initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional data processing pipelines are typically static and handcrafted for specific tasks, limiting their adaptability to evolving requirements. While general-purpose agents and coding assistants can generate code for well-understood data pipelines, they lack the ability to autonomously monitor, manage, and optimize an end-to-end pipeline once deployed. We present \textbf{Autonomous Data Processing using Meta-agents} (ADP-MA), a framework that dynamically constructs, executes, and iteratively refines data processing pipelines through hierarchical agent orchestration. At its core, \textit{meta-agents} analyze input data and task specifications to design a multi-phase plan, instantiate specialized \textit{ground-level agents}, and continuously evaluate pipeline performance. The architecture comprises three key components: a planning module for strategy generation, an orchestration layer for agent coordination and tool integration, and a monitoring loop for iterative evaluation and backtracking. Unlike conventional approaches, ADP-MA emphasizes context-aware optimization, adaptive workload partitioning, and progressive sampling for scalability. Additionally, the framework leverages a diverse set of external tools and can reuse previously designed agents, reducing redundancy and accelerating pipeline construction. We demonstrate ADP-MA through an interactive demo that showcases pipeline construction, execution monitoring, and adaptive refinement across representative data processing tasks.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Differentially Private Federated Learning Framework with Bi-level Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>EduEVAL-DB: A Role-Based Dataset for Pedagogical Risk Evaluation in Educational Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces EduEVAL-DB, a dataset based on teacher roles designed to support the evaluation and training of automatic pedagogical evaluators and AI tutors for instructional explanations. The dataset comprises 854 explanations corresponding to 139 questions from a curated subset of the ScienceQA benchmark, spanning science, language, and social science across K-12 grade levels. For each question, one human-teacher explanation is provided and six are generated by LLM-simulated teacher roles. These roles are inspired by instructional styles and shortcomings observed in real educational practice and are instantiated via prompt engineering. We further propose a pedagogical risk rubric aligned with established educational standards, operationalizing five complementary risk dimensions: factual correctness, explanatory depth and completeness, focus and relevance, student-level appropriateness, and ideological bias. All explanations are annotated with binary risk labels through a semi-automatic process with expert teacher review. Finally, we present preliminary validation experiments to assess the suitability of EduEVAL-DB for evaluation. We benchmark a state-of-the-art education-oriented model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) against a lightweight local Llama 3.1 8B model and examine whether supervised fine-tuning on EduEVAL-DB supports pedagogical risk detection using models deployable on consumer hardware.</description>

      <title>EnterpriseBench Corecraft: Training Generalizable Agents on High-Fidelity RL Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution. We introduce CoreCraft, the first environment in EnterpriseBench, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. CoreCraft is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM 4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37% to 36.76% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4% on Tau2-Bench Retail, and +6.8% on Tool Decathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.</description>

      <title>Defining and Evaluating Physical Safety for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to control robotic systems such as drones, but their risks of causing physical threats and harm in real-world applications remain unexplored. Our study addresses the critical gap in evaluating LLM physical safety by developing a comprehensive benchmark for drone control. We classify the physical safety risks of drones into four categories: (1) human-targeted threats, (2) object-targeted threats, (3) infrastructure attacks, and (4) regulatory violations. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals an undesirable trade-off between utility and safety, with models that excel in code generation often performing poorly in crucial safety aspects. Furthermore, while incorporating advanced prompt engineering techniques such as In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought can improve safety, these methods still struggle to identify unintentional attacks. In addition, larger models demonstrate better safety capabilities, particularly in refusing dangerous commands. Our findings and benchmark can facilitate the design and evaluation of physical safety for LLMs. The project page is available at huggingface.co/spaces/TrustSafeAI/LLM-physical-safety.</description>

Abstract: Large Foundation Models like Dust3r can produce high quality outputs such as pointmaps, camera intrinsics, and depth estimation, given stereo-image pairs as input. However, the application of these outputs on tasks like Visual Localization requires a large amount of inference time and compute resources. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose the use of a knowledge distillation pipeline, where we aim to build a student-teacher model with Dust3r as the teacher and explore multiple architectures of student models that are trained using the 3D reconstructed points output by Dust3r. Our goal is to build student models that can learn scene-specific representations and output 3D points with replicable performance such as Dust3r. The data set we used to train our models is 12Scenes. We test two main architectures of models: a CNN-based architecture and a Vision Transformer based architecture. For each architecture, we also compare the use of pre-trained models against models built from scratch. We qualitatively compare the reconstructed 3D points output by the student model against Dust3r's and discuss the various features learned by the student model. We also perform ablation studies on the models through hyperparameter tuning. Overall, we observe that the Vision Transformer presents the best performance visually and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Point-DeepONet: Predicting Nonlinear Fields on Non-Parametric Geometries under Variable Load Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear structural analyses in engineering often require extensive finite element simulations, limiting their applicability in design optimization and real-time control. Conventional deep learning surrogates often struggle with complex, non-parametric three-dimensional (3D) geometries and directionally varying loads. This work presents Point-DeepONet, an operator-learning-based surrogate that integrates PointNet into the DeepONet framework to learn a mapping from non-parametric geometries and variable load conditions to physical response fields. By leveraging PointNet to learn a geometric representation from raw point clouds, our model circumvents the need for manual parameterization. This geometric embedding is then synergistically fused with load conditions within the DeepONet architecture to accurately predict three-dimensional displacement and von Mises stress fields. Trained on a large-scale dataset, Point-DeepONet demonstrates high fidelity, achieving a coefficient of determination (R^2) reaching 0.987 for displacement and 0.923 for von Mises stress. Furthermore, to rigorously validate its generalization capabilities, we conducted additional experiments on unseen, randomly oriented load directions, where the model maintained exceptional accuracy. Compared to nonlinear finite element analyses that require about 19.32 minutes per case, Point-DeepONet provides predictions in mere seconds--approximately 400 times faster--while maintaining excellent scalability. These findings, validated through extensive experiments and ablation studies, highlight the potential of Point-DeepONet to enable rapid, high-fidelity structural analyses for complex engineering workflows.</description>

      <title>Self-Improving Skill Learning for Robust Skill-based Meta-Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03752v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) facilitates rapid adaptation to unseen tasks but faces challenges in long-horizon environments. Skill-based approaches tackle this by decomposing state-action sequences into reusable skills and employing hierarchical decision-making. However, these methods are highly susceptible to noisy offline demonstrations, leading to unstable skill learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Self-Improving Skill Learning (SISL), which performs self-guided skill refinement using decoupled high-level and skill improvement policies, while applying skill prioritization via maximum return relabeling to focus updates on task-relevant trajectories, resulting in robust and stable adaptation even under noisy and suboptimal data. By mitigating the effect of noise, SISL achieves reliable skill learning and consistently outperforms other skill-based meta-RL methods on diverse long-horizon tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/epsilog/SISL.</description>

Abstract: Deep generative models based on neural differential equations have quickly become the state-of-the-art for numerous generation tasks across many different applications. These models rely on ODE/SDE solvers which integrate from a prior distribution to the data distribution. In many applications it is highly desirable to then integrate in the other direction. The standard solvers, however, accumulate discretization errors which don't align with the forward trajectory, thereby prohibiting an exact inversion. In applications where the precision of the generative model is paramount this inaccuracy in inversion is often unacceptable. Current approaches to solving the inversion of these models results in significant downstream issues with poor stability and low-order of convergence; moreover, they are strictly limited to the ODE domain. In this work, we propose a new family of reversible exponential (stochastic) Runge-Kutta solvers which we refer to as Rex developed by an application of Lawson methods to convert any explicit (stochastic) Runge-Kutta scheme into a reversible one. In addition to a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed solvers, we also empirically demonstrate the utility of Rex on improving the sampling of Boltzmann distributions with flow models, and improving image generation and editing capabilities with diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Simple Self Organizing Map with Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04121v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various vision tasks. However, they tend to underperform on smaller datasets due to their inherent lack of inductive biases. Current approaches address this limitation implicitly-often by pairing ViTs with pretext tasks or by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to strengthen the prior. In contrast, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a widely adopted self-supervised framework, are inherently structured to preserve topology and spatial organization, making them a promising candidate to directly address the limitations of ViTs in limited or small training datasets. Despite this potential, equipping SOMs with modern deep learning architectures remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a novel exploration on how Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can empower each other, aiming to bridge this critical research gap. Our findings demonstrate that these architectures can synergistically enhance each other, leading to significantly improved performance in both unsupervised and supervised tasks.

      <title>Cert-SSBD: Certified Backdoor Defense with Sample-Specific Smoothing Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an attacker manipulates a small portion of the training data to implant hidden backdoors into the model. The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary. However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples. To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/Cert-SSB.</description>

      <title>ReplaceMe: Network Simplification via Depth Pruning and Transformer Block Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02819v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation, which approximates the pruned blocks. The estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25\% pruning while retaining approximately 90\% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead. We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at https://github.com/mts-ai/ReplaceMe</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a robust methodology for automatic segmentation of infected lung regions in COVID-19 CT scans using convolutional neural networks. The approach is based on a modified U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, data augmentation, and postprocessing techniques. It achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.8658 and mean IoU of 0.8316, outperforming other methods. The dataset was sourced from public repositories and augmented for diversity. Results demonstrate superior segmentation performance. Future work includes expanding the dataset, exploring 3D segmentation, and preparing the model for clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Oversmoothing, Oversquashing, Heterophily, Long-Range, and more: Demystifying Common Beliefs in Graph Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After a renaissance phase in which researchers revisited the message-passing paradigm through the lens of deep learning, the graph machine learning community shifted its attention towards a deeper and practical understanding of message-passing's benefits and limitations. In this paper, we notice how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and oversquashing, the homophily-heterophily dichotomy, and long-range tasks, came with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions -- under the form of universal statements -- that are not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has led to ambiguities around the investigated problems, preventing researchers from focusing on and addressing precise research questions while causing a good amount of misunderstandings. Our contribution is to make such common beliefs explicit and encourage critical thinking around these topics, refuting universal statements via simple yet formally sufficient counterexamples. The end goal is to clarify conceptual differences, helping researchers address more clearly defined and targeted problems.</description>

      <title>On the Design of KL-Regularized Policy Gradient Algorithms for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17508v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective? We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a clipped-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO. We extend our experiments to 8K context length, and RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip achieves 52% accuracy on AIME25, surpassing the official Qwen3-4B-Instruct model (47%). Notably, RPG is a stable and scalable RL algorithm for LLM reasoning, realized via (a) a KL-correct objective, (b) clipped importance sampling, and (c) an iterative reference-policy update scheme.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the major technological advancements of this century, bearing incredible potential for users through AI-powered applications and tools in numerous domains. Being often black-box (i.e., its decision-making process is unintelligible), developers typically resort to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to interpret the behaviour of AI models to produce systems that are transparent, fair, reliable, and trustworthy. However, presenting explanations to the user is not trivial and is often left as a secondary aspect of the system's design process, leading to AI systems that are not useful to end-users. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review on Explanation User Interfaces (XUIs) to gain a deeper understanding of the solutions and design guidelines employed in the academic literature to effectively present explanations to users. To improve the contribution and real-world impact of this survey, we also present a platform to support Human-cEnteRed developMent of Explainable user interfaceS (HERMES) and guide practitioners and scholars in the design and evaluation of XUIs.</description>

      <title>FinTagging: Benchmarking LLMs for Extracting and Structuring Financial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20650v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of numerical data in financial reports is critical for markets and regulators. Although XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) provides a standard for tagging financial figures, mapping thousands of facts to over 10k US GAAP concepts remains costly and error prone. Existing benchmarks oversimplify this task as flat, single step classification over small subsets of concepts, ignoring the hierarchical semantics of the taxonomy and the structured nature of financial documents. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) under realistic reporting conditions. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinTagging, the first comprehensive benchmark for structure aware and full scope XBRL tagging. We decompose the complex tagging process into two subtasks: (1) FinNI (Financial Numeric Identification), which extracts entities and types from heterogeneous contexts including text and tables; and (2) FinCL (Financial Concept Linking), which maps extracted entities to the full US GAAP taxonomy. This two stage formulation enables a fair assessment of LLMs' capabilities in numerical reasoning and taxonomy alignment. Evaluating diverse LLMs in zero shot settings reveals that while models generalize well in extraction, they struggle significantly with fine grained concept linking, highlighting critical limitations in domain specific structure aware reasoning.</description>

      <title>Automated Web Application Testing: End-to-End Test Case Generation with Large Language Models and Screen Transition Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Web applications are critical to modern software ecosystems, yet ensuring their reliability remains challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature of web interfaces. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating complex tasks, but limitations persist in handling dynamic navigation flows and complex form interactions. This paper presents an automated system for generating test cases for two key aspects of web application testing: site navigation and form filling. For site navigation, the system employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and generate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle conditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site navigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating form-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating form-interaction testing. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in improving test coverage and robustness, advancing the state of web application testing.</description>

      <title>Persona-driven Simulation of Voting Behavior in the European Parliament with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or even produce political discourse but have been found to consistently exhibit a progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic groups with which the base model is not aligned. In this work, we analyze whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict the positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate whether predictions are stable in response to counterfactual arguments, different persona prompts, and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate the voting behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well, achieving a weighted F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024 European Parliament and our code are available at the following url: https://github.com/dess-mannheim/european_parliament_simulation.</description>

      <title>DeepQuark: A Deep-Neural-Network Approach to Multiquark Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound $\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Strict Subgoal Execution: Reliable Long-Horizon Planning in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions, their reliance on conventional hindsight relabeling often fails to correct subgoal infeasibility, leading to inefficient high-level planning. To address this, we propose Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL framework that integrates Frontier Experience Replay (FER) to separate unreachable from admissible subgoals and streamline high-level decision making. FER delineates the reachability frontier using failure and partial-success transitions, which identifies unreliable subgoals, increases subgoal reliability, and reduces unnecessary high-level decisions. Additionally, SSE employs a decoupled exploration policy to cover underexplored regions of the goal space and a path refinement that adjusts edge costs using observed low-level failures. Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks show that SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL methods in both efficiency and success rate.

      <title>MCIF: Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction-Following Benchmark from Scientific Talks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have laid the foundation for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which unify text, speech, and vision within a single framework. As these models are rapidly evolving toward general-purpose instruction following across diverse and complex tasks, a key frontier is evaluating their crosslingual and multimodal capabilities over both short- and long-form inputs. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on a single modality at a time, rely on short-form inputs, or lack human annotations--hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first crosslingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks on NLP and beyond. MCIF evaluates instruction following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over different input lengths and spans four macro-tasks: recognition, translation, question answering, and summarization. It covers three core modalities (speech, vision, and text) and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), fully aligned across all dimensions. This parallel design enables a systematic evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and effectively integrate multimodal contextual information. Our benchmarking and analysis of 23 models highlight universal challenges across modalities and tasks, indicating substantial room for improvement in future MLLMs development.

      <title>CareerPooler: AI-Powered Metaphorical Pool Simulation Improves Experience and Outcomes in Career Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11461</link>

Abstract: Career exploration is uncertain, requiring decisions with limited information and unpredictable outcomes. While generative AI offers new opportunities for career guidance, most systems rely on linear chat interfaces that produce overly comprehensive and idealized suggestions, overlooking the non-linear and effortful nature of real-world trajectories. We present CareerPooler, a generative AI-powered system that employs a pool-table metaphor to simulate career development as a spatial and narrative interaction. Users strike balls representing milestones, skills, and random events, where hints, collisions, and rebounds embody decision-making under uncertainty. In a within-subjects study with 24 participants, CareerPooler significantly improved engagement, information gain, satisfaction, and career clarity compared to a chatbot baseline. Qualitative findings show that spatial-narrative interaction fosters experience-based learning, resilience through setbacks, and reduced psychological burden. Our findings contribute to the design of AI-assisted career exploration systems and more broadly suggest that visually grounded analogical interactions can make generative systems engaging and satisfying.</description>

      <title>Discrete optimal transport is a strong audio adversarial attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the discrete optimal transport voice conversion ($k$DOT-VC) method. Comparison with $k$NN-VC, SinkVC, and Gaussian optimal transport (MKL) demonstrates stronger domain adaptation abilities of our method. We use the probabilistic nature of optimal transport (OT) and show that $k$DOT-VC is an effective black-box adversarial attack against modern audio anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs). Our attack operates as a post-processing, distribution-alignment step: frame-level {WavLM} embeddings of generated speech are aligned to an unpaired bona fide pool via entropic OT and a top-$k$ barycentric projection, then decoded with a neural vocoder. Ablation analysis indicates that distribution-level alignment is a powerful and stable attack for deployed CMs.</description>

      <title>Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19877v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description>

      <title>CoSpaDi: Compressing LLMs via Calibration-Guided Sparse Dictionary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22075v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) often relies on low-rank weight approximations that represent each column of the weight matrix in a shared low-dimensional subspace. This strategy is computationally efficient but the underlying constraint can be overly rigid for heterogeneous projection weights and may incur avoidable accuracy loss. We propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a training-free framework that replaces low-rank factorization with a structured sparse decomposition in which each weight matrix is represented as a dense dictionary multiplied by a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This yields a union-of-subspaces model: the columns of the weight matrix are represented as linear combinations of different subsets of dictionary atoms, improving expressiveness at a fixed parameter budget. CoSpaDi is calibration-guided: using a small calibration set, we optimize the factorization to minimize functional reconstruction error of layer outputs rather than weight-space error. An activation-derived Gram orthonormalization reformulates this data-aware objective into a standard dictionary learning problem on transformed weights, and we support both per-layer compression and cross-layer dictionary sharing within groups of similar projections. Across Llama and Qwen model families, CoSpaDi consistently improves the accuracy--compression and perplexity--compression trade-offs over state-of-the-art SVD-based baselines and strong structured pruning baselines at 20-40\% compression ratios. The resulting structured sparsity enables sparse--dense computation and integrates with post-training quantization of the sparse coefficients.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models (DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a &gt;99% true positive rate with minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Search Using Side Information for Diffusion-Based Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely used as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search algorithm that guides the sampling process using side information. Our framework can be added to existing diffusion-based reconstruction pipelines in a plug-and-play manner, without requiring any training. Through extensive experiments across a range of inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, and several deblurring tasks, and across multiple diffusion-based inverse problem solvers (DPS, DAPS, and MPGD), we show that augmenting each solver with our framework consistently improves the quality of the reconstructions over the corresponding original method. In order to demonstrate the generality of our approach, we consider diverse forms of side information, including reference images, textual descriptions, and anatomical MRI scans. We also show that our search-based approach outperforms other ways of incorporating side information, including reward gradient-based method.

      <title>Multimodal Prompt Optimization: Why Not Leverage Multiple Modalities for MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images, videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>pi-Flow: Policy-Based Few-Step Generation via Imitation Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep. The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming previous 1-NFE models of the same DiT architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art DMD models, while maintaining teacher-level quality.</description>

      <title>VERA-MH Concept Paper</title>

Abstract: We introduce VERA-MH (Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health), an automated evaluation of the safety of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts, with an initial focus on suicide risk.
  Practicing clinicians and academic experts developed a rubric informed by best practices for suicide risk management for the evaluation. To fully automate the process, we used two ancillary AI agents. A user-agent model simulates users engaging in a mental health-based conversation with the chatbot under evaluation. The user-agent role-plays specific personas with pre-defined risk levels and other features. Simulated conversations are then passed to a judge-agent who scores them based on the rubric. The final evaluation of the chatbot being tested is obtained by aggregating the scoring of each conversation.
  VERA-MH is actively under development and undergoing rigorous validation by mental health clinicians to ensure user-agents realistically act as patients and that the judge-agent accurately scores the AI chatbot. To date we have conducted preliminary evaluation of GPT-5, Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet using initial versions of the VERA-MH rubric and used the findings for further design development. Next steps will include more robust clinical validation and iteration, as well as refining actionable scoring. We are seeking feedback from the community on both the technical and clinical aspects of our evaluation.</description>

      <title>LRT-Diffusion: Calibrated Risk-Aware Guidance for Diffusion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL) but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget. Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline RL.</description>

      <title>VeriStruct: AI-assisted Automated Verification of Data-Structure Modules in Verus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce VeriStruct, a novel framework that extends AI-assisted automated verification from single functions to more complex data structure modules in Verus. VeriStruct employs a planner module to orchestrate the systematic generation of abstractions, type invariants, specifications, and proof code. To address the challenge that LLMs often misunderstand Verus' annotation syntax and verification-specific semantics, VeriStruct embeds syntax guidance within prompts and includes a repair stage to automatically correct annotation errors. In an evaluation on eleven Rust data structure modules, VeriStruct succeeds on ten of the eleven, successfully verifying 128 out of 129 functions (99.2%) in total. These results represent an important step toward the goal of automatic AI-assisted formal verification.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization with Limited Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of preference optimization has made outstanding contributions to the alignment of language models with human preferences. Despite these advancements, recent methods still rely heavily on substantial paired (labeled) feedback data, leading to substantial resource expenditures. To address these challenges, we study the problem of Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) in which the idea is to learn from both a small number of pairwise preference labels and a large pool of unpaired samples simultaneously. Our key theoretical contribution proves the existence of an optimal reward threshold capable of separating winning and losing responses with high probability, which enables a principled pseudo-labeling of unpaired data. By leveraging these pseudo-labels, SSPO effectively distills latent preferences from large-scale unpaired data, thus maintaining human alignment while drastically reducing acquisition costs. Extensive experiments across datasets validate this remarkable data efficiency; for instance, SSPO trained with Mistral-7B-Instruct on just 1% of UltraFeedback consistently surpasses strong baselines trained on 10% of UltraFeedback.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models with Intrinsic Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning ability of large language models, yet training remains costly because many rollouts contribute little to optimization, considering the amount of computation required. This study investigates how simply leveraging intrinsic data properties, almost free benefit during training, can improve data efficiency for RLVR. We propose PREPO with two complementary components. First, we adopt prompt perplexity as an indicator of model adaptability in learning, enabling the model to progress from well-understood contexts to more challenging ones. Second, we amplify the discrepancy among the rollouts by differentiating their relative entropy, and prioritize sequences that exhibit a higher degree of exploration. Together, these mechanisms reduce rollout demand while preserving competitive performance. On the Qwen and Llama models, PREPO achieves effective results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with up to 3 times fewer rollouts than the baselines. Beyond empirical gains, we provide theoretical and in-depth analyses explaining the underlying rationale of our method to improve the data efficiency of RLVR.</description>

      <title>State of the Art in Text Classification for South Slavic Languages: Fine-Tuning or Prompting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Until recently, fine-tuned BERT-like models provided state-of-the-art performance on text classification tasks. With the rise of instruction-tuned decoder-only models, commonly known as large language models (LLMs), the field has increasingly moved toward zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English. However, we also point out key drawbacks of LLMs, including less predictable outputs, significantly slower inference, and higher computational costs. Due to these limitations, fine-tuned BERT-like models remain a more practical choice for large-scale automatic text annotation.</description>

      <title>Improving segmentation of retinal arteries and veins using cardiac signal in doppler holograms</title>

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

      <title>Multimodal Wireless Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Wireless foundation models (WFMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities, jointly performing multiple wireless functions and adapting effectively to new environments. However, while current WFMs process only one modality, depending on the task and operating conditions, the most informative modality changes and no single modality is best for all tasks. WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities. We believe this provides a concrete step toward both AI-native 6G and the vision of joint sensing, communication, and localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents the Empathetic Cascading Networks (ECN) framework, a multi-stage prompting method designed to enhance the empathetic and inclusive capabilities of large language models. ECN employs four stages: Perspective Adoption, Emotional Resonance, Reflective Understanding, and Integrative Synthesis, to guide models toward generating emotionally resonant and contextually aware responses. Experimental results demonstrate that ECN achieves the highest Empathy Quotient (EQ) scores across GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, while maintaining competitive Regard and Perplexity metrics. These findings emphasize ECN's potential for applications requiring empathy and inclusivity in conversational AI.</description>

      <title>AI/ML based Joint Source and Channel Coding for HARQ-ACK Payload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Channel coding from 2G to 5G has assumed the inputs bits at the physical layer to be uniformly distributed. However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel "free-lunch" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Surrogates: High-Fidelity Local Explanations for Black-Box Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of black-box machine learning models and their adoption in high-stakes areas, it is critical to provide explanations for their predictions. Existing local explanation methods lack in generating high-fidelity explanations. This paper proposes a novel local model agnostic explanation method to generate high-fidelity explanations using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and N-ball sampling strategies. MARS is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity. The N-ball sampling technique samples perturbed samples directly from a desired distribution instead of reweighting, leading to further improvement in the faithfulness. The performance of the proposed method was computed in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) and evaluated on five different benchmark datasets with different kernel width. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher local surrogate fidelity compared to baseline local explanation methods, with an average reduction of 32% in root mean square error, indicating more accurate local approximations of the black-box model. Additionally, statistical analysis shows that across all benchmark datasets, the proposed approach results were statistically significantly better. This paper advances the field of explainable AI by providing insights that can benefit the broader research and practitioner community.</description>

      <title>Restrictive Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation for Stratified Tooth Layer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate understanding of anatomical structures is essential for reliably staging certain dental diseases. A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes.</description>

      <title>Explanation Bias is a Product: Revealing the Hidden Lexical and Position Preferences in Post-Hoc Feature Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Good quality explanations strengthen the understanding of language models and data. Feature attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradient, are a type of post-hoc explainer that can provide token-level insights. However, explanations on the same input may vary greatly due to underlying biases of different methods. Users may be aware of this issue and mistrust their utility, while unaware users may trust them inadequately. In this work, we delve beyond the superficial inconsistencies between attribution methods, structuring their biases through a model- and method-agnostic framework of three evaluation metrics. We systematically assess both lexical and position bias (what and where in the input) for two transformers; first, in a controlled, pseudo-random classification task on artificial data; then, in a semi-controlled causal relation detection task on natural data. We find a trade-off between lexical and position biases in our model comparison, with models that score high on one type score low on the other. We also find signs that anomalous explanations are more likely to be biased.</description>

      <title>Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19941v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent runtime. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.</description>

      <title>On the Existence and Behavior of Secondary Attention Sinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention sinks are tokens, often the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token, that receive disproportionately high attention despite limited semantic relevance. In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.</description>

      <title>Theory of Mind for Explainable Human-Robot Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the context of human-robot interaction (HRI), Theory of Mind (ToM) is intended to serve as a user-friendly backend to the interface of robotic systems, enabling robots to infer and respond to human mental states. When integrated into robots, ToM allows them to adapt their internal models to users' behaviors, enhancing the interpretability and predictability of their actions. Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations. Incorporating ToM would enable a change in focus, prioritizing the user's informational needs and perspective.</description>

      <title>Improved Object-Centric Diffusion Learning with Registers and Contrastive Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) with pretrained diffusion models has recently shown promise for object-centric learning (OCL), but suffers from slot entanglement and weak alignment between object slots and image content. We propose Contrastive Object-centric Diffusion Alignment (CODA), a simple extension that (i) employs register slots to absorb residual attention and reduce interference between object slots, and (ii) applies a contrastive alignment loss to explicitly encourage slot-image correspondence. The resulting training objective serves as a tractable surrogate for maximizing mutual information (MI) between slots and inputs, strengthening slot representation quality. On both synthetic (MOVi-C/E) and real-world datasets (VOC, COCO), CODA improves object discovery (e.g., +6.1% FG-ARI on COCO), property prediction, and compositional image generation over strong baselines. Register slots add negligible overhead, keeping CODA efficient and scalable. These results indicate potential applications of CODA as an effective framework for robust OCL in complex, real-world scenes. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/sony/coda.</description>

      <title>Symphonym: Universal Phonetic Embeddings for Cross-Script Name Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linking names across historical sources, languages, and writing systems remains a fundamental challenge in digital humanities and geographic information retrieval. Existing approaches require language-specific phonetic algorithms or fail to capture phonetic relationships across different scripts. This paper presents Symphonym, a neural embedding system that maps names from any script into a unified 128-dimensional phonetic space, enabling direct similarity comparison without runtime phonetic conversion. Symphonym uses a Teacher-Student architecture where a Teacher network trained on articulatory phonetic features produces target embeddings, while a Student network learns to approximate these embeddings directly from characters. The Teacher combines Epitran (extended with 100 new language-script mappings), Phonikud for Hebrew, and CharsiuG2P for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Training used 32.7 million triplet samples of toponyms spanning 20 writing systems from GeoNames, Wikidata, and Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. On the MEHDIE Hebrew-Arabic historical toponym benchmark, Symphonym achieves Recall@10 of 97.6% and MRR of 90.3%, outperforming Levenshtein and Jaro-Winkler baselines (Recall@1: 86.7% vs 81.5% and 78.5%). Evaluation on 12,947 real cross-script training pairs shows 82.6% achieve greater than 0.75 cosine similarity, with best performance on Arabic-Cyrillic (94--100%) and Cyrillic-Latin (94.3%) combinations. The fixed-length embeddings enable efficient retrieval in digital humanities workflows, with a case study on medieval personal names demonstrating effective transfer from modern place names to historical orthographic variation.</description>

Abstract: As generative AI becomes embedded in higher education, it increasingly shapes how students complete academic tasks. While these systems offer efficiency and support, concerns persist regarding over-automation, diminished student agency, and the potential for unreliable or hallucinated outputs. This study conducts a mixed-methods audit of student-AI collaboration preferences by examining the alignment between current AI capabilities and students' desired levels of automation in academic work. Using two sequential and complementary surveys, we capture students' perceived benefits, risks, and preferred boundaries when using AI. The first survey employs an existing task-based framework to assess preferences for and actual usage of AI across 12 academic tasks, alongside primary concerns and reasons for use. The second survey, informed by the first, explores how AI systems could be designed to address these concerns through open-ended questions. This study aims to identify gaps between existing AI affordances and students' normative expectations of collaboration, informing the development of more effective and trustworthy AI systems for education.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Pattern Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graph learning is pivotal for deciphering dynamic systems, where the core challenge lies in explicitly modeling the underlying evolving patterns that govern network transformation. However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability.

      <title>Fixed Budget is No Harder Than Fixed Confidence in Best-Arm Identification up to Logarithmic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The best-arm identification (BAI) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in interactive machine learning, which has two flavors: the fixed-budget setting (FB) and the fixed-confidence setting (FC).
  For $K$-armed bandits with the unique best arm, the optimal sample complexities for both settings have been settled down, and they match up to logarithmic factors.
  This prompts an interesting research question about the generic, potentially structured BAI problems: Is FB harder than FC or the other way around?
  In this paper, we show that FB is no harder than FC up to logarithmic factors.
  We do this constructively: we propose a novel algorithm called FC2FB (fixed confidence to fixed budget), which is a meta algorithm that takes in an FC algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ and turn it into an FB algorithm.
  We prove that this FC2FB enjoys a sample complexity that matches, up to logarithmic factors, that of the sample complexity of $\mathcal{A}$.
  This means that the optimal FC sample complexity is an upper bound of the optimal FB sample complexity up to logarithmic factors.
  Our result not only reveals a fundamental relationship between FB and FC, but also has a significant implication: FC2FB, combined with existing state-of-the-art FC algorithms, leads to improved sample complexity for a number of FB problems.</description>

      <title>Di3PO - Diptych Diffusion DPO for Targeted Improvements in Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for preference tuning of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often rely on computationally expensive generation steps to create positive and negative pairs of images. These approaches frequently yield training pairs that either lack meaningful differences, are expensive to sample and filter, or exhibit significant variance in irrelevant pixel regions, thereby degrading training efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce "Di3PO", a novel method for constructing positive and negative pairs that isolates specific regions targeted for improvement during preference tuning, while keeping the surrounding context in the image stable. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to the challenging task of text rendering in diffusion models, showcasing improvements over baseline methods of SFT and DPO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC, 2023--2025) is the largest competition to date for building fully autonomous cyber reasoning systems (CRSs) that leverage recent advances in AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs) -- to discover and remediate vulnerabilities in real-world open-source software. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of AIxCC. Drawing on design documents, source code, execution traces, and discussions with organizers and competing teams, we examine the competition's structure and key design decisions, characterize the architectural approaches of finalist CRSs, and analyze competition results beyond the final scoreboard. Our analysis reveals the factors that truly drove CRS performance, identifies genuine technical advances achieved by teams, and exposes limitations that remain open for future research. We conclude with lessons for organizing future competitions and broader insights toward deploying autonomous CRSs in practice.</description>

      <title>The Chicken and Egg Dilemma: Co-optimizing Data and Model Configurations for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Co-optimizing data and model configurations for training LLMs presents a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma: The best training data configuration (e.g., data mixture) for a downstream task depends on the chosen model configuration (e.g., model architecture), and vice versa. However, jointly optimizing both data and model configurations is often deemed intractable, and existing methods focus on either data or model optimization without considering their interaction. We introduce JoBS, an approach that uses a scaling-law-inspired performance predictor to aid Bayesian optimization (BO) in jointly optimizing LLM training data and model configurations efficiently. JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs. We study JoBS's average regret and devise the optimal budget allocation to minimize regret. JoBS outperforms existing multi-fidelity BO baselines, as well as data and model optimization approaches across diverse LLM tasks under the same optimization budget.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Guided Pretraining for Brain Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing interest in foundation models for brain signals, graph-based pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for learning transferable representations from connectome data. However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions. Extensive experiments across multiple neuroimaging datasets with over 25,000 subjects and 60,000 scans involving various mental disorders and brain atlases demonstrate consistent performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Biases in the Blind Spot: Detecting What LLMs Fail to Mention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces that appear plausible, but may hide internal biases. We call these *unverbalized biases*. Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across seven LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity). More broadly, our proposed approach provides a practical, scalable path to automatic task-specific bias discovery.</description>

      <title>LoRA-Squeeze: Simple and Effective Post-Tuning and In-Tuning Compression of LoRA Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its huge number of variants, standard Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is still a dominant technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off.</description>

      <title>MolmoSpaces: A Large-Scale Open Ecosystem for Robot Navigation and Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.</description>

      <title>SCOPE: Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise LLM Judging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to replace costly human preference labels in pairwise evaluation. Despite their practicality, LLM judges remain prone to miscalibration and systematic biases. This paper proposes SCOPE (Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise Evaluation), a framework for selective pairwise judging with finite-sample statistical guarantees. Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $\alpha$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $\alpha = 0.10$, SCOPE consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B. Compared to na\"ive baselines, SCOPE accepts up to $2.4\times$ more judgments on MT-Bench with Qwen-7B under the same target risk constraint, demonstrating that BPE enables reliable and high-coverage LLM-based evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With rapid expansion of cellular networks and the proliferation of mobile devices, cellular traffic data exhibits complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations, posing challenges to accurate traffic prediction. Previous methods often focus predominantly on temporal modeling or depend on predefined spatial topologies, which limits their ability to jointly model spatio-temporal dependencies and effectively capture periodic patterns in cellular traffic. To address these issues, we propose a cellular traffic prediction framework that integrates spatio-temporal modeling with time-frequency analysis. First, we construct a spatial modeling branch to capture inter-cell dependencies through an attention mechanism, minimizing the reliance on predefined topological structures. Second, we build a time-frequency modeling branch to enhance the representation of periodic patterns. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive-scale LogCosh loss function, which adjusts the error penalty based on traffic magnitude, preventing large errors from dominating the training process and helping the model maintain relatively stable prediction accuracy across different traffic intensities. Experiments on three open-sourced datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves prediction performance superior to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>VisPhyWorld: Probing Physical Reasoning via Code-Driven Video Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) genuinely reason about physical dynamics remains challenging. Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics.</description>

      <title>How Multimodal Large Language Models Support Access to Visual Information: A Diary Study With Blind and Low Vision People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are changing how Blind and Low Vision (BLV) people access visual information. Unlike traditional visual interpretation tools that only provide descriptions, MLLM-enabled applications offer conversational assistance, where users can ask questions to obtain goal-relevant details. However, evidence about their performance in the real-world and implications for BLV people's daily lives remains limited. To address this, we conducted a two-week diary study, where we captured 20 BLV participants' use of an MLLM-enabled visual interpretation application. Although participants rated the visual interpretations of the application as "trustworthy" (mean=3.76 out of 5, max=extremely trustworthy) and "somewhat satisfying" (mean=4.13 out of 5, max=very satisfying), the AI often produced incorrect answers (22.2%) or abstained (10.8%) from responding to users' requests. Our findings show that while MLLMs can improve visual interpretations' descriptive accuracy, supporting everyday use also depends on the "visual assistant" skill: behaviors for providing goal-directed, reliable assistance. We conclude by proposing the "visual assistant" skill and guidelines to help MLLM-enabled visual interpretation applications better support BLV people's access to visual information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) can automatically delineate lesions on computed tomography (CT) and generate radiology report content, yet progress is limited by the scarcity of publicly available CT datasets with lesion-level annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce CT-Bench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset comprising two components: a Lesion Image and Metadata Set containing 20,335 lesions from 7,795 CT studies with bounding boxes, descriptions, and size information, and a multitask visual question answering benchmark with 2,850 QA pairs covering lesion localization, description, size estimation, and attribute categorization. Hard negative examples are included to reflect real-world diagnostic challenges. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art multimodal models, including vision-language and medical CLIP variants, by comparing their performance to radiologist assessments, demonstrating the value of CT-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark for lesion analysis. Moreover, fine-tuning models on the Lesion Image and Metadata Set yields significant performance gains across both components, underscoring the clinical utility of CT-Bench.</description>

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses the original data into compact synthetic datasets, reducing training time and storage while retaining model performance, enabling deployment under limited resources. Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration--Exploitation Distillation (E$^2$D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E$^2$D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being $18\times$ faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining $4.3\times$ faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

      <title>Logit Distance Bounds Representational Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a broad family of discriminative models that includes autoregressive language models, identifiability results imply that if two models induce the same conditional distributions, then their internal representations agree up to an invertible linear transformation. We ask whether an analogous conclusion holds approximately when the distributions are close instead of equal. Building on the observation of Nielsen et al. (2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts. In distillation experiments on synthetic and image datasets, logit-distance distillation yields students with higher linear representational similarity and better preservation of the teacher's linearly recoverable concepts.</description>

      <title>Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography Image Processing and Vessel Classification Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution visualization of coronary vessel anatomy but presents challenges due to noise, imaging artifacts, and complex tissue structures. This paper proposes a fully automated pipeline for vessel segmentation and classification in OCT images using machine learning techniques. The proposed method integrates image preprocessing, guidewire artifact removal, polar-to-Cartesian transformation, unsupervised K-means clustering, and local feature extraction. These features are used to train Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine classifiers for pixel-wise vessel classification. Experimental results demonstrate excellent performance, achieving precision, recall, and F1-score values up to 1.00 and overall classification accuracy of 99.68%. The proposed approach provides accurate vessel boundary detection while maintaining low computational complexity and requiring minimal manual annotation. This method offers a reliable and efficient solution for automated OCT image analysis and has potential applications in clinical decision support and real-time medical image processing.</description>

      <title>Building Safe and Deployable Clinical Natural Language Processing under Temporal Leakage Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical natural language processing (NLP) models have shown promise for supporting hospital discharge planning by leveraging narrative clinical documentation. However, note-based models are particularly vulnerable to temporal and lexical leakage, where documentation artifacts encode future clinical decisions and inflate apparent predictive performance. Such behavior poses substantial risks for real-world deployment, where overconfident or temporally invalid predictions can disrupt clinical workflows and compromise patient safety. This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training. Using next-day discharge prediction after elective spine surgery as a case study, we evaluate how auditing affects predictive behavior, calibration, and safety-relevant trade-offs. Results show that audited models exhibit more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced reliance on discharge-related lexical cues. These findings emphasize that deployment-ready clinical NLP systems should prioritize temporal validity, calibration, and behavioral robustness over optimistic performance.</description>

      <title>Resp-Agent: An Agent-Based System for Multimodal Respiratory Sound Generation and Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based respiratory auscultation is currently hindered by two fundamental challenges: (i) inherent information loss, as converting signals into spectrograms discards transient acoustic events and clinical context; (ii) limited data availability, exacerbated by severe class imbalance. To bridge these gaps, we present Resp-Agent, an autonomous multimodal system orchestrated by a novel Active Adversarial Curriculum Agent (Thinker-A$^2$CA). Unlike static pipelines, Thinker-A$^2$CA serves as a central controller that actively identifies diagnostic weaknesses and schedules targeted synthesis in a closed loop. To address the representation gap, we introduce a Modality-Weaving Diagnoser that weaves EHR data with audio tokens via Strategic Global Attention and sparse audio anchors, capturing both long-range clinical context and millisecond-level transients. To address the data gap, we design a Flow Matching Generator that adapts a text-only Large Language Model (LLM) via modality injection, decoupling pathological content from acoustic style to synthesize hard-to-diagnose samples. As a foundation for these efforts, we introduce Resp-229k, a benchmark corpus of 229k recordings paired with LLM-distilled clinical narratives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Resp-Agent consistently outperforms prior approaches across diverse evaluation settings, improving diagnostic robustness under data scarcity and long-tailed class imbalance. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zpforlove/Resp-Agent.</description>

      <title>Omni-iEEG: A Large-Scale, Comprehensive iEEG Dataset and Benchmark for Epilepsy Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research. The project page with dataset and code links is available at omni-ieeg.github.io/omni-ieeg.</description>

      <title>Conjugate Learning Theory: Uncovering the Mechanisms of Trainability and Generalization in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a notion of practical learnability grounded in finite sample settings, and develop a conjugate learning theoretical framework based on convex conjugate duality to characterize this learnability property. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that training deep neural networks (DNNs) with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves global optima of empirical risk by jointly controlling the extreme eigenvalues of a structure matrix and the gradient energy, and we establish a corresponding convergence theorem. We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability. On the generalization front, we derive deterministic and probabilistic bounds on generalization error based on generalized conditional entropy measures. The former explicitly delineates the range of generalization error, while the latter characterizes the distribution of generalization error relative to the deterministic bounds under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling conditions. Furthermore, these bounds explicitly quantify the influence of three key factors: (i) information loss induced by irreversibility in the model, (ii) the maximum attainable loss value, and (iii) the generalized conditional entropy of features with respect to labels. Moreover, they offer a unified theoretical lens for understanding the roles of regularization, irreversible transformations, and network depth in shaping the generalization behavior of deep neural networks. Extensive experiments validate all theoretical predictions, confirming the framework's correctness and consistency.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs Ready to Replace Bangla Annotators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated annotators to scale dataset creation, yet their reliability as unbiased annotators--especially for low-resource and identity-sensitive settings--remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the behavior of LLMs as zero-shot annotators for Bangla hate speech, a task where even human agreement is challenging, and annotator bias can have serious downstream consequences. We conduct a systematic benchmark of 17 LLMs using a unified evaluation framework. Our analysis uncovers annotator bias and substantial instability in model judgments. Surprisingly, increased model scale does not guarantee improved annotation quality--smaller, more task-aligned models frequently exhibit more consistent behavior than their larger counterparts. These results highlight important limitations of current LLMs for sensitive annotation tasks in low-resource languages and underscore the need for careful evaluation before deployment.</description>

      <title>RoboGene: Boosting VLA Pre-training via Diversity-Driven Agentic Framework for Real-World Task Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of general-purpose robotic manipulation is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, real-world interaction data. Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation. Our project is available at https://robogene-boost-vla.github.io.</description>

      <title>Calibrate-Then-Act: Cost-Aware Exploration in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs are increasingly being used for complex problems which are not necessarily resolved in a single response, but require interacting with an environment to acquire information. In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA. Our results on information-seeking QA and on a simplified coding task show that making cost-benefit tradeoffs explicit with CTA can help agents discover more optimal decision-making strategies.</description>

      <title>Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies: customer service protocols, approval workflows, data access restrictions, and regulatory compliance. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement.
  Enforcing such policies requires tracking information flow across agents, which linear message histories cannot capture. Instead, PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing causal relationships among events such as tool calls, tool results, and messages. Policies are expressed in a Datalog-derived language, as declarative rules that account for transitive information flow and cross-agent provenance. A reference monitor intercepts all actions and blocks violations before execution, providing deterministic enforcement independent of model reasoning.
  PCAS takes an existing agent implementation and a policy specification, and compiles them into an instrumented system that is policy-compliant by construction, with no security-specific restructuring required. We evaluate PCAS on three case studies: information flow policies for prompt injection defense, approval workflows in a multi-agent pharmacovigilance system, and organizational policies for customer service. On customer service tasks, PCAS improves policy compliance from 48% to 93% across frontier models, with zero policy violations in instrumented runs.</description>
