      <title>In Vino Veritas and Vulnerabilities: Examining LLM Safety via Drunk Language Inducement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans are susceptible to undesirable behaviours and privacy leaks under the influence of alcohol. This paper investigates drunk language, i.e., text written under the influence of alcohol, as a driver for safety failures in large language models (LLMs). We investigate three mechanisms for inducing drunk language in LLMs: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training. When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language. The simplicity and efficiency of our drunk language inducement approaches position them as potential counters for LLM safety tuning, highlighting significant risks to LLM safety.</description>

      <title>MrRoPE: Mixed-radix Rotary Position Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)-extension refers to modifying or generalizing the Rotary Position Embedding scheme to handle longer sequences than those encountered during pre-training. However, current extension strategies are highly diverse and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper, we propose MrRoPE (Mixed-radix RoPE), a generalized encoding formulation based on a radix system conversion perspective, which elegantly unifies various RoPE-extension approaches as distinct radix conversion strategies. Based on this theory, we introduce two training-free extensions, MrRoPE-Uni and MrRoPE-Pro, which leverage uniform and progressive radix conversion strategies, respectively, to achieve 'train short, test long' generalization. Without fine-tuning, MrRoPE-Pro sustains over 85% recall in the 128K-context Needle-in-a-Haystack test and achieves more than double YaRN's accuracy on Infinite-Bench retrieval and dialogue subsets. Theoretical analysis confirms that MrRoPE-Pro effectively raises the upper bound of RoPE's attainable encoding length, which further validates the reliability and utility of our theory and methodology.</description>

      <title>Prepare Reasoning Language Models for Multi-Agent Debate with Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have been substantially improved by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). At test time, collaborative reasoning through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing LLM performance. However, current RLVR methods typically train LLMs to solve problems in isolation, without explicitly preparing them to synthesize and benefit from different rationales that arise during debate. In this work, we propose Self-Debate Reinforcement Learning (SDRL), a training framework that equips a single LLM with strong standalone problem-solving ability and the capability to learn from diverse reasoning trajectories in MAD. Given a prompt, SDRL first samples multiple candidate solutions, then constructs a debate context with diverse reasoning paths and generates second-turn responses conditioned on this context. Finally, SDRL jointly optimizes both the initial and debate-conditioned responses, yielding a model that is effective as both a standalone solver and a debate participant. Experiments across multiple base models and reasoning benchmarks show that SDRL improves overall MAD performance while simultaneously strengthening single model reasoning.</description>

      <title>MERMAID: Memory-Enhanced Retrieval and Reasoning with Multi-Agent Iterative Knowledge Grounding for Veracity Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the veracity of online content has become increasingly critical. Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled substantial progress in automated veracity assessment, including automated fact-checking and claim verification systems. Typical veracity assessment pipelines break down complex claims into sub-claims, retrieve external evidence, and then apply LLM reasoning to assess veracity. However, existing methods often treat evidence retrieval as a static, isolated step and do not effectively manage or reuse retrieved evidence across claims. In this work, we propose MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent veracity assessment framework that tightly couples the retrieval and reasoning processes. MERMAID integrates agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module within a Reason-Action style iterative process, enabling dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim evidence reuse. By retaining retrieved evidence in an evidence memory, the framework reduces redundant searches and improves verification efficiency and consistency. We evaluate MERMAID on three fact-checking benchmarks and two claim-verification datasets using multiple LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. Experimental results show that MERMAID achieves state-of-the-art performance while improving the search efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of synergizing retrieval, reasoning, and memory for reliable veracity assessment.</description>

      <title>Context Structure Reshapes the Representational Geometry of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to organize the representations of input sequences into straighter neural trajectories in their deep layers, which has been hypothesized to facilitate next-token prediction via linear extrapolation. Language models can also adapt to diverse tasks and learn new structure in context, and recent work has shown that this in-context learning (ICL) can be reflected in representational changes. Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process. Instead, we propose that LLMs function like a Swiss Army knife: depending on task structure, the LLM dynamically selects between strategies, only some of which yield representational straightening.</description>

      <title>Stability-Aware Prompt Optimization for Clinical Data Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models used for clinical abstraction are sensitive to prompt wording, yet most work treats prompts as fixed and studies uncertainty in isolation. We argue these should be treated jointly. Across two clinical tasks (MedAlign applicability/correctness and MS subtype abstraction) and multiple open and proprietary models, we measure prompt sensitivity via flip rates and relate it to calibration and selective prediction. We find that higher accuracy does not guarantee prompt stability, and that models can appear well-calibrated yet remain fragile to paraphrases. We propose a dual-objective prompt optimization loop that jointly targets accuracy and stability, showing that explicitly including a stability term reduces flip rates across tasks and models, sometimes at modest accuracy cost. Our results suggest prompt sensitivity should be an explicit objective when validating clinical LLM systems.</description>

      <title>SPLA: Block Sparse Plus Linear Attention for Long Context Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block-wise sparse attention offers significant efficiency gains for long-context modeling, yet existing methods often suffer from low selection fidelity and cumulative contextual loss by completely discarding unselected blocks. To address these limitations, we introduce Sparse Plus Linear Attention (SPLA), a framework that utilizes a selection metric derived from second-order Taylor expansions to accurately identify relevant blocks for exact attention. Instead of discarding the remaining "long tail," SPLA compresses unselected blocks into a compact recurrent state via a residual linear attention (RLA) module. Crucially, to avoid IO overhead, we derive an optimized subtraction-based formulation for RLA -- calculating the residual as the difference between global and selected linear attention -- ensuring that unselected blocks are never explicitly accessed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SPLA closes the performance gap in continual pretraining, surpassing dense attention models on long-context benchmarks like RULER while maintaining competitive general knowledge and reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>SP^2DPO: An LLM-assisted Semantic Per-Pair DPO Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) controls the trade-off between fitting preference labels and staying close to a reference model using a single global temperature beta, implicitly treating all preference pairs as equally informative. Real-world preference corpora are heterogeneous: they mix high-signal, objective failures (for example, safety, factuality, instruction violations) with low-signal or subjective distinctions (for example, style), and also include label noise. We introduce our method, SP2DPO (Semantic Per-Pair DPO), a generalization that replaces the global temperature with an instance-specific schedule beta_i pre-decided offline from structured semantic-gap annotations (category, magnitude, confidence) produced by teacher language models. We instantiate this procedure on the UltraFeedback preference corpus (59,960 pairs), enabling large-scale construction of an auditable beta_i artifact, and incur zero training-time overhead: the inner-loop optimizer remains standard DPO with beta set per pair. We focus our empirical study on AlpacaEval 2.0, reporting both raw win rate and length-controlled win rate. Across four open-weight, instruction-tuned student backbones (4B-8B), SP2DPO is competitive with a tuned global-beta DPO baseline and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 length-controlled win rate on two of four backbones, while avoiding per-model beta sweeps. All code, annotations, and artifacts will be released.</description>

      <title>Specialists or Generalists? Multi-Agent and Single-Agent LLMs for Essay Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) systems increasingly rely on large language models, yet little is known about how architectural choices shape their performance across different essay quality levels. This paper evaluates single-agent and multi-agent LLM architectures for essay grading using the ASAP 2.0 corpus. Our multi-agent system decomposes grading into three specialist agents (Content, Structure, Language) coordinated by a Chairman Agent that implements rubric-aligned logic including veto rules and score capping. We test both architectures in zero-shot and few-shot conditions using GPT-5.1. Results show that the multi-agent system is significantly better at identifying weak essays while the single-agent system performs better on mid-range essays. Both architectures struggle with high-quality essays. Critically, few-shot calibration emerges as the dominant factor in system performance -- providing just two examples per score level improves QWK by approximately 26% for both architectures. These findings suggest architectural choice should align with specific deployment priorities, with multi-agent AI particularly suited for diagnostic screening of at-risk students, while single-agent models provide a cost-effective solution for general assessment.</description>

      <title>Culturally Grounded Personas in Large Language Models: Characterization and Alignment with Socio-Psychological Value Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating human behavior, the extent to which these synthetic personas accurately reflect world and moral value systems across different cultural conditionings remains uncertain. This paper investigates the alignment of synthetic, culturally-grounded personas with established frameworks, specifically the World Values Survey (WVS), the Inglehart-Welzel Cultural Map, and Moral Foundations Theory. We conceptualize and produce LLM-generated personas based on a set of interpretable WVS-derived variables, and we examine the generated personas through three complementary lenses: positioning on the Inglehart-Welzel map, which unveils their interpretation reflecting stable differences across cultural conditionings; demographic-level consistency with the World Values Survey, where response distributions broadly track human group patterns; and moral profiles derived from a Moral Foundations questionnaire, which we analyze through a culture-to-morality mapping to characterize how moral responses vary across different cultural configurations. Our approach of culturally-grounded persona generation and analysis enables evaluation of cross-cultural structure and moral variation.</description>

      <title>Bifocal Attention: Harmonizing Geometric and Spectral Positional Embeddings for Algorithmic Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become the standard for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their ability to encode relative positions through geometric rotation. However, we identify a significant limitation we term ''Spectral Rigidity'': standard RoPE utilizes a fixed geometric decay ($\theta^{-i}$) optimized for local syntactic coherence, which fails to capture the long-range, periodic structures inherent in recursive logic and algorithmic reasoning. This results in a ''Structure Gap'', where models trained on shallow reasoning chains fail to extrapolate to deeper recursive steps. In this work, we introduce Bifocal Attention, an architectural paradigm that decouples positional encoding into two distinct modalities: Geometric Eyes (Standard RoPE) for precise token-level manipulation, and Spectral Eyes (Learnable Harmonic Operators) for tracking long-range recursive depth. We propose a novel training protocol, Spectral Evolution, which initializes positional frequencies as static geometric parameters but allows them to evolve via gradient descent into a harmonic basis optimized for the specific algorithmic topology of the task.</description>

      <title>Word-Centered Semantic Graphs for Interpretable Diachronic Sense Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an interpretable, graph-based framework for analyzing semantic shift in diachronic corpora. For each target word and time slice, we induce a word-centered semantic network that integrates distributional similarity from diachronic Skip-gram embeddings with lexical substitutability from time-specific masked language models. We identify sense-related structure by clustering the peripheral graph, align clusters across time via node overlap, and track change through cluster composition and normalized cluster mass. In an application study on a corpus of New York Times Magazine articles (1980 - 2017), we show that graph connectivity reflects polysemy dynamics and that the induced communities capture contrasting trajectories: event-driven sense replacement (trump), semantic stability with cluster over-segmentation effects (god), and gradual association shifts tied to digital communication (post). Overall, word-centered semantic graphs offer a compact and transparent representation for exploring sense evolution without relying on predefined sense inventories.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agents Are Not Always Faithful Self-Evolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-evolving large language model (LLM) agents continually improve by accumulating and reusing past experience, yet it remains unclear whether they faithfully rely on that experience to guide their behavior. We present the first systematic investigation of experience faithfulness, the causal dependence of an agent's decisions on the experience it is given, in self-evolving LLM agents. Using controlled causal interventions on both raw and condensed forms of experience, we comprehensively evaluate four representative frameworks across 10 LLM backbones and 9 environments. Our analysis uncovers a striking asymmetry: while agents consistently depend on raw experience, they often disregard or misinterpret condensed experience, even when it is the only experience provided. This gap persists across single- and multi-agent configurations and across backbone scales. We trace its underlying causes to three factors: the semantic limitations of condensed content, internal processing biases that suppress experience, and task regimes where pretrained priors already suffice. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about self-evolving methods and underscore the need for more faithful and reliable approaches to experience integration.</description>

      <title>Stop Jostling: Adaptive Negative Sampling Reduces the Marginalization of Low-Resource Language Tokens by Cross-Entropy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural language models often struggle with low-resource languages due to the limited availability of training data, making tokens from these languages rare in the training set. This paper addresses a specific challenge during training: rare tokens are disproportionately affected by marginalization, which prevents them from learning effectively. We propose a thresholding technique that reduces the impact of this marginalization, allowing rare tokens to benefit from more meaningful alignment. Through experiments with a character-level language model, we demonstrate that this method significantly improves performance on low-resource language validation data. This work is the first to show how negative sampling can be applied to improve the representation of rare tokens by limiting the harmful influence of excessive marginalization, offering a new approach to enhancing language model performance for underrepresented languages.</description>

      <title>SSL: Sweet Spot Learning for Differentiated Guidance in Agentic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training intelligent agents. However, existing methods typically employ binary rewards that fail to capture quality differences among trajectories achieving identical outcomes, thereby overlooking potential diversity within the solution space. Inspired by the ``sweet spot'' concept in tennis-the racket's core region that produces optimal hitting effects, we introduce \textbf{S}weet \textbf{S}pot \textbf{L}earning (\textbf{SSL}), a novel framework that provides differentiated guidance for agent optimization. SSL follows a simple yet effective principle: progressively amplified, tiered rewards guide policies toward the sweet-spot region of the solution space. This principle naturally adapts across diverse tasks: visual perception tasks leverage distance-tiered modeling to reward proximity, while complex reasoning tasks reward incremental progress toward promising solutions. We theoretically demonstrate that SSL preserves optimal solution ordering and enhances the gradient signal-to-noise ratio, thereby fostering more directed optimization. Extensive experiments across GUI perception, short/long-term planning, and complex reasoning tasks show consistent improvements over strong baselines on 12 benchmarks, achieving up to 2.5X sample efficiency gains and effective cross-task transferability. Our work establishes SSL as a general principle for training capable and robust agents.</description>

      <title>Mock Worlds, Real Skills: Building Small Agentic Language Models with Synthetic Tasks, Simulated Environments, and Rubric-Based Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small LLMs often struggle to match the agentic capabilities of large, costly models. While reinforcement learning can help, progress has been limited by two structural bottlenecks: existing open-source agentic training data are narrow in task variety and easily solved; real-world APIs lack diversity and are unstable for large-scale reinforcement learning rollout processes. We address these challenges with SYNTHAGENT, a framework that jointly synthesizes diverse tool-use training data and simulates complete environments. Specifically, a strong teacher model creates novel tasks and tool ecosystems, then rewrites them into intentionally underspecified instructions. This compels agents to actively query users for missing details. When handling synthetic tasks, an LLM-based user simulator provides user-private information, while a mock tool system delivers stable tool responses. For rewards, task-level rubrics are constructed based on required subgoals, user-agent interactions, and forbidden behaviors. Across 14 challenging datasets in math, search, and tool use, models trained on our synthetic data achieve substantial gains, with small models outperforming larger baselines.</description>

      <title>One Ring to Rule Them All: Unifying Group-Based RL via Dynamic Power-Mean Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning has evolved from the arithmetic mean of GRPO to the geometric mean of GMPO. While GMPO improves stability by constraining a conservative objective, it shares a fundamental limitation with GRPO: reliance on a fixed aggregation geometry that ignores the evolving and heterogeneous nature of each trajectory. In this work, we unify these approaches under Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized framework that parameterizes the aggregation geometry via the power-mean geometry exponent p. Within this framework, GRPO and GMPO are recovered as special cases. Theoretically, we demonstrate that adjusting p modulates the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens based on their advantage contribution. To determine p adaptively, we introduce a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism. Specifically, we propose a deterministic rule that maps a trajectory clipping fraction to a target ESS. Then, we solve for the specific p to align the trajectory induced ESS with this target one. This allows PMPO to dynamically transition between the aggressive arithmetic mean for reliable trajectories and the conservative geometric mean for unstable ones. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PMPO outperforms strong baselines.</description>

      <title>$\rho$-$\texttt{EOS}$: Training-free Bidirectional Variable-Length Control for Masked Diffusion LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond parallel generation and global context modeling, current masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) suffer from a fundamental limitation: they require a predefined, fixed generation length, which lacks flexibility and forces an inevitable trade-off between output quality and computational efficiency. To address this, we study the denoising dynamics and find that the implicit density ($\rho$) of end-of-sequence ($\texttt{EOS}$) tokens serves as a reliable signal of generation sufficiency. In particular, the evolving implicit $\texttt{EOS}$ density during denoising reveals whether the current masked space is excessive or insufficient, thereby guiding the adjustment direction for generation length. Building on this insight, we propose $\textbf{$\rho$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$, a training-free, single-stage strategy that enables bidirectional variable-length generation for masked dLLMs. Unlike prior two-stage approaches--which require separate length adjustment and iterative mask insertion phases while supporting only unidirectional expansion--$\textbf{$\rho$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves bidirectional length adjustment within a unified denoising process by continuously estimating the implicit $\texttt{EOS}$ density: excessively high density triggers $\texttt{MASK}$ token contraction, while insufficient density induces expansion. Extensive experiments on mathematics and code benchmarks demonstrate that $\textbf{$\rho$-$\texttt{EOS}$}$ achieves comparable performance while substantially improving inference efficiency and token utilization.</description>

      <title>Towards the Holographic Characteristic of LLMs for Efficient Short-text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted interest in exploring their in-context learning abilities and chain-of-thought capabilities. However, there are few studies investigating the specific traits related to the powerful generation capacity of LLMs. This paper aims to delve into the generation characteristics exhibited by LLMs. Through our investigation, we have discovered that language models tend to capture target-side keywords at the beginning of the generation process. We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario. The results demonstrate that HOLO achieves comparable performance to the baselines in terms of both automatic and human-like evaluation metrics and highlight the potential of the Holographic Characteristic.</description>

      <title>Are LLM Evaluators Really Narcissists? Sanity Checking Self-Preference Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLM) favor own outputs when acting as judges, undermining the integrity of automated post-training and evaluation workflows. However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of "easy" versus "hard" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects.</description>

      <title>SpanNorm: Reconciling Training Stability and Performance in Deep Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on the stable training of deep Transformer architectures. A critical design choice is the placement of normalization layers, leading to a fundamental trade-off: the ``PreNorm'' architecture ensures training stability at the cost of potential performance degradation in deep models, while the ``PostNorm'' architecture offers strong performance but suffers from severe training instability. In this work, we propose SpanNorm, a novel technique designed to resolve this dilemma by integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Structurally, SpanNorm establishes a clean residual connection that spans the entire transformer block to stabilize signal propagation, while employing a PostNorm-style computation that normalizes the aggregated output to enhance model performance. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that SpanNorm, combined with a principled scaling strategy, maintains bounded signal variance throughout the network, preventing the gradient issues that plague PostNorm models, and also alleviating the representation collapse of PreNorm. Empirically, SpanNorm consistently outperforms standard normalization schemes in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and stable Transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Rethinking LLM-as-a-Judge: Representation-as-a-Judge with Small Language Models via Semantic Capacity Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as reference-free evaluators via prompting, but this "LLM-as-a-Judge" paradigm is costly, opaque, and sensitive to prompt design. In this work, we investigate whether smaller models can serve as efficient evaluators by leveraging internal representations instead of surface generation. We uncover a consistent empirical pattern: small LMs, despite with weak generative ability, encode rich evaluative signals in their hidden states. This motivates us to propose the Semantic Capacity Asymmetry Hypothesis: evaluation requires significantly less semantic capacity than generation and can be grounded in intermediate representations, suggesting that evaluation does not necessarily need to rely on large-scale generative models but can instead leverage latent features from smaller ones. Our findings motivate a paradigm shift from LLM-as-a-Judge to Representation-as-a-Judge, a decoding-free evaluation strategy that probes internal model structure rather than relying on prompted output. We instantiate this paradigm through INSPECTOR, a probing-based framework that predicts aspect-level evaluation scores from small model representations. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, GPQA) show that INSPECTOR substantially outperforms prompting-based small LMs and closely approximates full LLM judges, while offering a more efficient, reliable, and interpretable alternative for scalable evaluation.</description>

      <title>Language Model Circuits Are Sparse in the Neuron Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-level concepts that a neural network uses to perform computation need not be aligned to individual neurons (Smolensky, 1986). Language model interpretability research has thus turned to techniques such as \textit{sparse autoencoders} (SAEs) to decompose the neuron basis into more interpretable units of model computation, for tasks such as \textit{circuit tracing}. However, not all neuron-based representations are uninterpretable. For the first time, we empirically show that \textbf{MLP neurons are as sparse a feature basis as SAEs}. We use this finding to develop an end-to-end pipeline for circuit tracing on the MLP neuron basis, which locates causal circuitry on a variety of tasks using gradient-based attribution. On a standard subject-verb agreement benchmark (Marks et al., 2025), a circuit of $\approx 10^2$ MLP neurons is enough to control model behaviour. On the multi-hop city $\to$ state $\to$ capital task from Lindsey et al., 2025, we find a circuit in which small sets of neurons encode specific latent reasoning steps (e.g.~`map city to its state'), and can be steered to change the model's output. This work thus advances automated interpretability of language models without additional training costs.</description>

      <title>Layer-wise Swapping for Generalizable Multilingual Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), safety risks remain a critical challenge for low-resource languages. Existing safety datasets are predominantly English centric, limiting progress in multilingual safety alignment. As a result, low resource expert models, finetuned on their respective instruction datasets, tend to exhibit higher unsafety rates compared to their high resource counterparts. In this work, we propose a safety aware layer swapping method that transfers safety alignment from an English safety expert to low resource language experts without additional training. To further enhance transfer ability, our method adaptively selects or blends modules based on their degree of specialization. Our approach preserves performance on general language understanding tasks while enhancing safety in the target languages. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the language expert on general benchmarks such as MMMLU, BELEBELE, and MGSM, while producing more aligned and less harmful responses on the MultiJail safety benchmark.</description>

      <title>Time-Annealed Perturbation Sampling: Diverse Generation for Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion language models (Diffusion-LMs) introduce an explicit temporal dimension into text generation, yet how this structure can be leveraged to control generation diversity for exploring multiple valid semantic or reasoning paths remains underexplored. In this paper, we show that Diffusion-LMs, like diffusion models in image generation, exhibit a temporal division of labor: early denoising steps largely determine the global semantic structure, while later steps focus on local lexical refinement. Building on this insight, we propose Time-Annealed Perturbation Sampling (TAPS), a training-free inference strategy that encourages semantic branching early in the diffusion process while progressively reducing perturbations to preserve fluency and instruction adherence. TAPS is compatible with both non-autoregressive and semi-autoregressive Diffusion backbones, demonstrated on LLaDA and TraDo in our paper, and consistently improves output diversity across creative writing and reasoning benchmarks without compromising generation quality.</description>

      <title>DART-ing Through the Drift: Dynamic Tracing of Knowledge Neurons for Adaptive Inference-Time Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial parameter redundancy, particularly in Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). Existing pruning methods suffer from two primary limitations. First, reliance on dataset-specific calibration introduces significant data dependency and computational overhead. Second, being predominantly static, they fail to account for the evolving subset of knowledge neurons in LLMs during autoregressive generation as the context evolves. To address this, we introduce DART, i.e., Dynamic Attention-Guided Runtime Tracing), a lightweight, training-free method that performs on-the-fly context-based pruning. DART monitors shifts in attention score distributions to infer context changes, dynamically updating neuron-level masks to retain salient parameters. Across ten benchmarks, DART outperforms prior dynamic baseline, achieving accuracy gains of up to 14.5% on LLAMA-3.1-8B at 70% FFN sparsity. Furthermore, DART achieves up to 3x better ROUGE-L scores with respect to static-masked pruning on summarization tasks, with its performance comparable to the original dense models. We conclusively demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively adapts to diverse semantic contexts, preserves model capabilities across both general and domain-specific tasks while running at less than 10MBs of memory for LLAMA-3.1-8B(16GBs) with 0.1% FLOPs overhead.

      <title>NAG: A Unified Native Architecture for Encoder-free Text-Graph Modeling in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing methods for integrating graphs into Language Models (LMs) typically rely on a segregated architecture: external Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encode structural topology, while LMs process textual semantics. We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models generate reasoning sequentially, preventing them from decoupling irrelevant exploration paths during search. We introduce Tree-Structured Language Modeling (TSLM), which uses special tokens to encode branching structure, enabling models to generate and selectively expand multiple search paths within a single generation process. By training on complete search trees including both successful and failed attempts, TSLM learns to internalize systematic exploration without redundant recomputation of shared prefixes. TSLM achieves robust performance and superior inference efficiency by avoiding the multiple independent forward passes required by external search methods. These results suggest a new paradigm of inference-time scaling for robust reasoning, demonstrating that supervised learning on complete tree-structured traces provides an efficient alternative for developing systematic exploration capabilities in language models.</description>

      <title>FNF: Functional Network Fingerprint for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) is costly and has significant commercial value. Consequently, preventing unauthorized appropriation of open-source LLMs and protecting developers' intellectual property rights have become critical challenges. In this work, we propose the Functional Network Fingerprint (FNF), a training-free, sample-efficient method for detecting whether a suspect LLM is derived from a victim model, based on the consistency between their functional network activity. We demonstrate that models that share a common origin, even with differences in scale or architecture, exhibit highly consistent patterns of neuronal activity within their functional networks across diverse input samples. In contrast, models trained independently on distinct data or with different objectives fail to preserve such activity alignment. Unlike conventional approaches, our method requires only a few samples for verification, preserves model utility, and remains robust to common model modifications (such as fine-tuning, pruning, and parameter permutation), as well as to comparisons across diverse architectures and dimensionalities. FNF thus provides model owners and third parties with a simple, non-invasive, and effective tool for protecting LLM intellectual property.

      <title>Models Know Models Best: Evaluation via Model-Preferred Formats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on multiple-choice tasks differs markedly between symbol-based and cloze-style evaluation formats. The observed discrepancies are systematically attributable to task characteristics: natural language continuation benefits from likelihood scoring, whereas explicit comparison is better suited to symbol-based selection. These trends are consistent across various decoder-based LLMs, indicating model-agnostic effects. To address these inconsistencies, a dynamic format-alignment strategy is introduced that employs a lightweight classifier trained on latent model-preference signals. In contrast to human-designed heuristics, which often degrade performance, this approach uses model-generated signals to determine the optimal format for each problem instance. The proposed method achieves substantial and consistent improvements in zero-shot accuracy across reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, better revealing the models' latent capabilities.</description>

      <title>MM-THEBench: Do Reasoning MLLMs Think Reasonably?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mark a shift from non-thinking models to post-trained reasoning models capable of solving complex problems through thinking. However, whether such thinking mitigates hallucinations in multimodal perception and reasoning remains unclear. Self-reflective reasoning enhances robustness but introduces additional hallucinations, and subtle perceptual errors still result in incorrect or coincidentally correct answers. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on models before the emergence of reasoning MLLMs, neglecting the internal thinking process and failing to measure the hallucinations that occur during thinking. To address these challenges, we introduce MM-THEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing hallucinations of intermediate CoTs in reasoning MLLMs. MM-THEBench features a fine-grained taxonomy grounded in cognitive dimensions, diverse data with verified reasoning annotations, and a multi-level automated evaluation framework. Extensive experiments on mainstream reasoning MLLMs reveal insights into how thinking affects hallucination and reasoning capability in various multimodal tasks.</description>

      <title>AR-BENCH: Benchmarking Legal Reasoning with Judgment Error Detection, Classification and Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal judgments may contain errors due to the complexity of case circumstances and the abstract nature of legal concepts, while existing appellate review mechanisms face efficiency pressures from a surge in case volumes. Although current legal AI research focuses on tasks like judgment prediction and legal document generation, the task of judgment review differs fundamentally in its objectives and paradigm: it centers on detecting, classifying, and correcting errors after a judgment is issued, constituting anomaly detection rather than prediction or generation. To address this research gap, we introduce a novel task APPELLATE REVIEW, aiming to assess models' diagnostic reasoning and reliability in legal practice. We also construct a novel dataset benchmark AR-BENCH, which comprises 8,700 finely annotated decisions and 34,617 supplementary corpora. By evaluating 14 large language models, we reveal critical limitations in existing models' ability to identify legal application errors, providing empirical evidence for future improvements.</description>

      <title>RASST: Fast Cross-modal Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation (SST) produces target text incrementally from partial speech input. Recent speech large language models (Speech LLMs) have substantially improved SST quality, yet they still struggle to correctly translate rare and domain-specific terminology. While retrieval augmentation has been effective for terminology translation in machine translation, bringing retrieval to SST is non-trivial: it requires fast and accurate cross-modal (speech-to-text) retrieval under partial, continually arriving input, and the model must decide whether and when to apply retrieved terms during incremental generation. We propose Retrieval-Augmented Simultaneous Speech Translation (RASST), which tightly integrates cross-modal retrieval into the SST pipeline. RASST trains a lightweight speech-text retriever and performs efficient sliding-window retrieval, providing chunkwise terminology hints to the Speech LLM. We further synthesize training data that teaches the Speech LLM to leverage retrieved terms precisely. Experiments on three language directions of the ACL 60/60 dev set show that RASST improves terminology translation accuracy by up to 16% and increases overall translation quality by up to 3 BLEU points, with ablations confirming the contribution of each component.</description>

      <title>Sparse or Dense? A Mechanistic Estimation of Computation Density in Transformer-based LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are comprised of billions of parameters arranged in deep and wide computational graphs. Several studies on LLM efficiency optimization argue that it is possible to prune a significant portion of the parameters, while only marginally impacting performance. This suggests that the computation is not uniformly distributed across the parameters. We introduce here a technique to systematically quantify computation density in LLMs. In particular, we design a density estimator drawing on mechanistic interpretability. We experimentally test our estimator and find that: (1) contrary to what has been often assumed, LLM processing generally involves dense computation; (2) computation density is dynamic, in the sense that models shift between sparse and dense processing regimes depending on the input; (3) per-input density is significantly correlated across LLMs, suggesting that the same inputs trigger either low or high density. Investigating the factors influencing density, we observe that predicting rarer tokens requires higher density, and increasing context length often decreases the density. We believe that our computation density estimator will contribute to a better understanding of the processing at work in LLMs, challenging their symbolic interpretation.</description>

      <title>When Meanings Meet: Investigating the Emergence and Quality of Shared Concept Spaces during Multilingual Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with high multilingual coverage is becoming increasingly important -- especially when monolingual resources are scarce. Recent studies have found that LLMs process multilingual inputs in shared concept spaces, thought to support generalization and cross-lingual transfer. However, these prior studies often do not use causal methods, lack deeper error analysis or focus on the final model only, leaving open how these spaces emerge during training. We investigate the development of language-agnostic concept spaces during pretraining of EuroLLM through the causal interpretability method of activation patching. We isolate cross-lingual concept representations, then inject them into a translation prompt to investigate how consistently translations can be altered, independently of the language. We find that shared concept spaces emerge early} and continue to refine, but that alignment with them is language-dependent}. Furthermore, in contrast to prior work, our fine-grained manual analysis reveals that some apparent gains in translation quality reflect shifts in behavior -- like selecting senses for polysemous words or translating instead of copying cross-lingual homographs -- rather than improved translation ability. Our findings offer new insight into the training dynamics of cross-lingual alignment and the conditions under which causal interpretability methods offer meaningful insights in multilingual contexts.</description>

      <title>From Labels to Facets: Building a Taxonomically Enriched Turkish Learner Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In terms of annotation structure, most learner corpora rely on holistic flat label inventories which, even when extensive, do not explicitly separate multiple linguistic dimensions. This makes linguistically deep annotation difficult and complicates fine-grained analyses aimed at understanding why and how learners produce specific errors. To address these limitations, this paper presents a semi-automated annotation methodology for learner corpora, built upon a recently proposed faceted taxonomy, and implemented through a novel annotation extension framework. The taxonomy provides a theoretically grounded, multi-dimensional categorization that captures the linguistic properties underlying each error instance, thereby enabling standardized, fine-grained, and interpretable enrichment beyond flat annotations. The annotation extension tool, implemented based on the proposed extension framework for Turkish, automatically extends existing flat annotations by inferring additional linguistic and metadata information as facets within the taxonomy to provide richer learner-specific context. It was systematically evaluated and yielded promising performance results, achieving a facet-level accuracy of 95.86%. The resulting taxonomically enriched corpus offers enhanced querying capabilities and supports detailed exploratory analyses across learner corpora, enabling researchers to investigate error patterns through complex linguistic and pedagogical dimensions. This work introduces the first collaboratively annotated and taxonomically enriched Turkish Learner Corpus, a manual annotation guideline with a refined tagset, and an annotation extender. As the first corpus designed in accordance with the recently introduced taxonomy, we expect our study to pave the way for subsequent enrichment efforts of existing error-annotated learner corpora.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs For Turkish Skill Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skill extraction is a critical component of modern recruitment systems, enabling efficient job matching, personalized recommendations, and labor market analysis. Despite T\"urkiye's significant role in the global workforce, Turkish, a morphologically complex language, lacks both a skill taxonomy and a dedicated skill extraction dataset, resulting in underexplored research in skill extraction for Turkish. This article seeks the answers to three research questions: 1) How can skill extraction be effectively performed for this language, in light of its low resource nature? 2)~What is the most promising model? 3) What is the impact of different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies on skill extraction (i.e., dynamic vs. static few-shot samples, varying context information, and encouraging causal reasoning)? The article introduces the first Turkish skill extraction dataset and performance evaluations of automated skill extraction using LLMs. The manually annotated dataset contains 4,819 labeled skill spans from 327 job postings across different occupation areas. The use of LLM outperforms supervised sequence labeling when used in an end-to-end pipeline, aligning extracted spans with standardized skills in the ESCO taxonomy more effectively. The best-performing configuration, utilizing Claude Sonnet 3.7 with dynamic few-shot prompting for skill identification, embedding-based retrieval, and LLM-based reranking for skill linking, achieves an end-to-end performance of 0.56, positioning Turkish alongside similar studies in other languages, which are few in the literature. Our findings suggest that LLMs can improve skill extraction performance in low-resource settings, and we hope that our work will accelerate similar research on skill extraction for underrepresented languages.</description>

      <title>Should LLMs, $\textit{like}$, Generate How Users Talk? Building Dialect-Accurate Dialog[ue]s Beyond the American Default with MDial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than 80% of the 1.6 billion English speakers do not use Standard American English (SAE) and experience higher failure rates and stereotyped responses when interacting with LLMs as a result. Yet multi-dialectal performance remains underexplored. We introduce $\textbf{MDial}$, the first large-scale framework for generating multi-dialectal conversational data encompassing the three pillars of written dialect -- lexical (vocabulary), orthographic (spelling), and morphosyntactic (grammar) features -- for nine English dialects. Partnering with native linguists, we design an annotated and scalable rule-based LLM transformation to ensure precision. Our approach challenges the assumption that models should mirror users' morphosyntactic features, showing that up to 90% of the grammatical features of a dialect should not be reproduced by models. Independent evaluations confirm data quality, with annotators preferring MDial outputs over prior methods in 98% of pairwise comparisons for dialect naturalness. Using this pipeline, we construct the dialect-parallel $\textbf{MDialBench}$mark with 50k+ dialogs, resulting in 97k+ QA pairs, and evaluate 17 LLMs on dialect identification and response generation tasks. Even frontier models achieve under 70% accuracy, fail to reach 50% for Canadian English, and systematically misclassify non-SAE dialects as American or British. As dialect identification underpins natural language understanding, these errors risk cascading failures into downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>DiffuSpeech: Silent Thought, Spoken Answer via Unified Speech-Text Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current speech language models generate responses directly without explicit reasoning, leading to errors that cannot be corrected once audio is produced. We introduce \textbf{``Silent Thought, Spoken Answer''} -- a paradigm where speech LLMs generate internal text reasoning alongside spoken responses, with thinking traces informing speech quality. To realize this, we present \method{}, the first diffusion-based speech-text language model supporting both understanding and generation, unifying discrete text and tokenized speech under a single masked diffusion framework. Unlike autoregressive approaches, \method{} jointly generates reasoning traces and speech tokens through iterative denoising, with modality-specific masking schedules. We also construct \dataset{}, the first speech QA dataset with paired text reasoning traces, containing 26K samples totaling 319 hours. Experiments show \method{} achieves state-of-the-art speech-to-speech QA accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by up to 9 points, while attaining the best TTS quality among generative models (6.2\% WER) and preserving language understanding (66.2\% MMLU). Ablations confirm that both the diffusion architecture and thinking traces contribute to these gains.</description>

      <title>LLMs Explain't: A Post-Mortem on Semantic Interpretability in Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in pervasive computing due to their versatility and strong performance. However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.
  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted. These limitations are particularly relevant in pervasive and distributed computing settings where LLMs are deployed as system components and interpretability methods are relied upon for debugging, compression, and explaining models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Machine Translation on Chinese Social Media Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence of rapidly evolving slang, neologisms, and highly stylized expressions in informal user-generated text, particularly on Chinese social media, poses significant challenges for Machine Translation (MT) benchmarking. Specifically, we identify two primary obstacles: (1) data scarcity, as high-quality parallel data requires bilingual annotators familiar with platform-specific slang, and stylistic cues in both languages; and (2) metric limitations, where traditional evaluators like COMET often fail to capture stylistic fidelity and nonstandard expressions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce CSM-MTBench, a benchmark covering five Chinese-foreign language directions and consisting of two expert-curated subsets: Fun Posts, featuring context-rich, slang- and neologism-heavy content, and Social Snippets, emphasizing concise, emotion- and style- driven expressions. Furthermore, we propose tailored evaluation approaches for each subset: measuring the translation success rate of slang and neologisms in Fun Posts, while assessing tone and style preservation in Social Snippets via a hybrid of embedding-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge. Experiments on over 20 models reveal substantial variation in how current MT systems handle semantic fidelity and informal, social-media-specific stylistic cues. CSM-MTBench thus serves as a rigorous testbed for advancing MT systems capable of mastering real-world Chinese social media texts.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Positional Alignment in Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to dominant autoregressive approaches. Although they achieve competitive performance on several tasks, a substantial gap remains in open-ended text generation. We hypothesize that one cause of this gap is that strict positional prediction makes MDLM decoding highly sensitive to token misalignment, and we show through controlled interventions that a one-position shift can severely disrupt semantics. This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a special token &lt;slack&gt; via the connectionist temporal classification objective. We apply this approach to the widely used MDLM model and conduct experiments on five open-ended text generation benchmarks. Our method consistently outperforms the original model and improves robustness to positional shifts, indicating that relaxing strict positional supervision is an important factor in improving generation quality in MDLMs.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Chain-of-Thought Distillation for Graph-Based Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based fraud detection on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) requires jointly modeling rich textual semantics and relational dependencies. However, existing LLM-enhanced GNN approaches are constrained by predefined prompting and decoupled training pipelines, limiting reasoning autonomy and weakening semantic-structural alignment. We propose FraudCoT, a unified framework that advances TAG-based fraud detection through autonomous, graph-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and scalable LLM-GNN co-training. To address the limitations of predefined prompts, we introduce a fraud-aware selective CoT distillation mechanism that generates diverse reasoning paths and enhances semantic-structural understanding. These distilled CoTs are integrated into node texts, providing GNNs with enriched, multi-hop semantic and structural cues for fraud detection. Furthermore, we develop an efficient asymmetric co-training strategy that enables end-to-end optimization while significantly reducing the computational cost of naive joint training. Extensive experiments on public and industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FraudCoT achieves up to 8.8% AUPRC improvement over state-of-the-art methods and delivers up to 1,066x speedup in training throughput, substantially advancing both detection performance and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to purely autoregressive language models because they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, state-of-the-art block-wise dLLMs rely on a "remasking" mechanism that decodes only the most confident tokens and discards the rest, effectively wasting computation. We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels.</description>

      <title>A Unified View of Attention and Residual Sinks: Outlier-Driven Rescaling is Essential for Transformer Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the functional role of emergent outliers in large language models, specifically attention sinks (a few tokens that consistently receive large attention logits) and residual sinks (a few fixed dimensions with persistently large activations across most tokens). We hypothesize that these outliers, in conjunction with the corresponding normalizations (\textit{e.g.}, softmax attention and RMSNorm), effectively rescale other non-outlier components. We term this phenomenon \textit{outlier-driven rescaling} and validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and training token counts. This view unifies the origin and mitigation of both sink types. Our main conclusions and observations include: (1) Outliers function jointly with normalization: removing normalization eliminates the corresponding outliers but degrades training stability and performance; directly clipping outliers while retaining normalization leads to degradation, indicating that outlier-driven rescaling contributes to training stability. (2) Outliers serve more as rescale factors rather than contributors, as the final contributions of attention and residual sinks are significantly smaller than those of non-outliers. (3) Outliers can be absorbed into learnable parameters or mitigated via explicit gated rescaling, leading to improved training performance (average gain of 2 points) and enhanced quantization robustness (1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization).</description>

      <title>Bias Beyond Borders: Political Ideology Evaluation and Steering in Multilingual LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape global discourse, making fairness and ideological neutrality essential for responsible AI deployment. Despite growing attention to political bias in LLMs, prior work largely focuses on high-resource, Western languages or narrow multilingual settings, leaving cross-lingual consistency and safe post-hoc mitigation underexplored. To address this gap, we present a large-scale multilingual evaluation of political bias spanning 50 countries and 33 languages. We introduce a complementary post-hoc mitigation framework, Cross-Lingual Alignment Steering (CLAS), designed to augment existing steering methods by aligning ideological representations across languages and dynamically regulating intervention strength. This method aligns latent ideological representations induced by political prompts into a shared ideological subspace, ensuring cross lingual consistency, with the adaptive mechanism prevents over correction and preserves coherence. Experiments demonstrate substantial bias reduction along both economic and social axes with minimal degradation in response quality. The proposed framework establishes a scalable and interpretable paradigm for fairness-aware multilingual LLM governance, balancing ideological neutrality with linguistic and cultural diversity.</description>

      <title>InstructDiff: Domain-Adaptive Data Selection via Differential Entropy for Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is fundamental to adapting large language models, yet training on complete datasets incurs prohibitive costs with diminishing returns. Existing data selection methods suffer from severe domain specificity: techniques optimized for general instruction-following fail on reasoning tasks, and vice versa. We observe that measuring entropy differences between base models and minimally instruction-tuned calibrated models reveals a pattern -- samples with the lowest differential entropy consistently yield optimal performance across domains, yet this principle manifests domain-adaptively: reasoning tasks favor entropy increase (cognitive expansion), while general tasks favor entropy decrease (cognitive compression). We introduce InstructDiff, a unified framework that operationalizes differential entropy as a domain-adaptive selection criterion through warmup calibration, bi-directional NLL filtering, and entropy-based ranking. Extensive experiments show that InstructDiff achieves 17\% relative improvement over full data training on mathematical reasoning and 52\% for general instruction-following, outperforming prior baselines while using only 10\% of the data.</description>

      <title>DimABSA: Building Multilingual and Multidomain Datasets for Dimensional Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) focuses on extracting sentiment at a fine-grained aspect level and has been widely applied across real-world domains. However, existing ABSA research relies on coarse-grained categorical labels (e.g., positive, negative), which limits its ability to capture nuanced affective states. To address this limitation, we adopt a dimensional approach that represents sentiment with continuous valence-arousal (VA) scores, enabling fine-grained analysis at both the aspect and sentiment levels. To this end, we introduce DimABSA, the first multilingual, dimensional ABSA resource annotated with both traditional ABSA elements (aspect terms, aspect categories, and opinion terms) and newly introduced VA scores. This resource contains 76,958 aspect instances across 42,590 sentences, spanning six languages and four domains. We further introduce three subtasks that combine VA scores with different ABSA elements, providing a bridge from traditional ABSA to dimensional ABSA. Given that these subtasks involve both categorical and continuous outputs, we propose a new unified metric, continuous F1 (cF1), which incorporates VA prediction error into standard F1. We provide a comprehensive benchmark using both prompted and fine-tuned large language models across all subtasks. Our results show that DimABSA is a challenging benchmark and provides a foundation for advancing multilingual dimensional ABSA.</description>

      <title>Character as a Latent Variable in Large Language Models: A Mechanistic Account of Emergent Misalignment and Conditional Safety Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent Misalignment refers to a failure mode in which fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on narrowly scoped data induces broadly misaligned behavior. Prior explanations mainly attribute this phenomenon to the generalization of erroneous or unsafe content. In this work, we show that this view is incomplete. Across multiple domains and model families, we find that fine-tuning models on data exhibiting specific character-level dispositions induces substantially stronger and more transferable misalignment than incorrect-advice fine-tuning, while largely preserving general capabilities. This indicates that emergent misalignment arises from stable shifts in model behavior rather than from capability degradation or corrupted knowledge. We further show that such behavioral dispositions can be conditionally activated by both training-time triggers and inference-time persona-aligned prompts, revealing shared structure across emergent misalignment, backdoor activation, and jailbreak susceptibility. Overall, our results identify character formation as a central and underexplored alignment risk, suggesting that robust alignment must address behavioral dispositions rather than isolated errors or prompt-level defenses.</description>

      <title>Safer Policy Compliance with Dynamic Epistemic Fallback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans develop a series of cognitive defenses, known as epistemic vigilance, to combat risks of deception and misinformation from everyday interactions. Developing safeguards for LLMs inspired by this mechanism might be particularly helpful for their application in high-stakes tasks such as automating compliance with data privacy laws. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Epistemic Fallback (DEF), a dynamic safety protocol for improving an LLM's inference-time defenses against deceptive attacks that make use of maliciously perturbed policy texts. Through various levels of one-sentence textual cues, DEF nudges LLMs to flag inconsistencies, refuse compliance, and fallback to their parametric knowledge upon encountering perturbed policy texts. Using globally recognized legal policies such as HIPAA and GDPR, our empirical evaluations report that DEF effectively improves the capability of frontier LLMs to detect and refuse perturbed versions of policies, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving a 100% detection rate in one setting. This work encourages further efforts to develop cognitively inspired defenses to improve LLM robustness against forms of harm and deception that exploit legal artifacts.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Utility of Grounding Documents with Reference-Free LLM-based Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)'s success depends on the utility the LLM derives from the content used for grounding. Quantifying content utility does not have a definitive specification and existing metrics ignore model-specific capabilities and/or rely on costly annotations. In this paper, we propose Grounding Generation Utility (GroGU), a model-specific and reference-free metric that defines utility as a function of the downstream LLM's generation confidence based on entropy. Despite having no annotation requirements, GroGU is largely faithful in distinguishing ground-truth documents while capturing nuances ignored by LLM-agnostic metrics. We apply GroGU to train a query-rewriter for RAG by identifying high-utility preference data for Direct Preference Optimization. Experiments show improvements by up to 18.2 points in Mean Reciprocal Rank and up to 9.4 points in answer accuracy.</description>

      <title>Monotonic Reference-Free Refinement for Autoformalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While statement autoformalization has advanced rapidly, full-theorem autoformalization remains largely unexplored. Existing iterative refinement methods in statement autoformalization typicall improve isolated aspects of formalization, such as syntactic correctness, but struggle to jointly optimizing multiple quality dimensions, which is critical for full-theorem autoformalization. We introduce a reference-free iterative monotonic process for full-theorem autoformalization that leverages complementary feedback from theorem provers and LLM-based judges, without access to ground-truth proofs or existing formalizations at inference time. Our approach optimizes a masked composite objective over Formal Validity, Logical Preservation, Mathematical Consistency, and Formal Quality, guided by a responsiveness map that indicates how different LLMs acting as different roles preferentially improve each dimension. We further propose an acceptance policy that guarantees certified monotonic improvement, and provide conditions ensuring convergence and termination. Empirical experiments demonstrate the proposed process enables simultaneous improvement across multiple dimensions, achieving 93.44% formal validity and a 78.22% overall score on miniF2F, and 44.09% formal validity and a 29.79% overall score on ProofNet.</description>

      <title>FourierSampler: Unlocking Non-Autoregressive Potential in Diffusion Language Models via Frequency-Guided Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the non-autoregressive potential of diffusion language models (dLLMs), existing decoding strategies demonstrate positional bias, failing to fully unlock the potential of arbitrary generation. In this work, we delve into the inherent spectral characteristics of dLLMs and present the first frequency-domain analysis showing that low-frequency components in hidden states primarily encode global structural information and long-range dependencies, while high-frequency components are responsible for characterizing local details. Based on this observation, we propose FourierSampler, which leverages a frequency-domain sliding window mechanism to dynamically guide the model to achieve a "structure-to-detail" generation. FourierSampler outperforms other inference enhancement strategies on LLADA and SDAR, achieving relative improvements of 20.4% on LLaDA1.5-8B and 16.0% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct. It notably surpasses similarly sized autoregressive models like Llama3.1-8B-Instruct.</description>

      <title>JobResQA: A Benchmark for LLM Machine Reading Comprehension on Multilingual R\'esum\'es and JDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce JobResQA, a multilingual Question Answering benchmark for evaluating Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) capabilities of LLMs on HR-specific tasks involving r\'esum\'es and job descriptions. The dataset comprises 581 QA pairs across 105 synthetic r\'esum\'e-job description pairs in five languages (English, Spanish, Italian, German, and Chinese), with questions spanning three complexity levels from basic factual extraction to complex cross-document reasoning. We propose a data generation pipeline derived from real-world sources through de-identification and data synthesis to ensure both realism and privacy, while controlled demographic and professional attributes (implemented via placeholders) enable systematic bias and fairness studies. We also present a cost-effective, human-in-the-loop translation pipeline based on the TEaR methodology, incorporating MQM error annotations and selective post-editing to ensure an high-quality multi-way parallel benchmark. We provide a baseline evaluations across multiple open-weight LLM families using an LLM-as-judge approach revealing higher performances on English and Spanish but substantial degradation for other languages, highlighting critical gaps in multilingual MRC capabilities for HR applications. JobResQA provides a reproducible benchmark for advancing fair and reliable LLM-based HR systems. The benchmark is publicly available at: https://github.com/Avature/jobresqa-benchmark</description>

      <title>ReGuLaR: Variational Latent Reasoning Guided by Rendered Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), explicit reasoning chains introduce substantial computational redundancy. Recent latent reasoning methods attempt to mitigate this by compressing reasoning processes into latent space, but often suffer from severe performance degradation due to the lack of appropriate compression guidance. In this study, we propose Rendered CoT-Guided variational Latent Reasoning (ReGuLaR), a simple yet novel latent learning paradigm resolving this issue. Fundamentally, we formulate latent reasoning within the Variational Auto-Encoding (VAE) framework, sampling the current latent reasoning state from the posterior distribution conditioned on previous ones. Specifically, when learning this variational latent reasoning model, we render explicit reasoning chains as images, from which we extract dense visual-semantic representations to regularize the posterior distribution, thereby achieving efficient compression with minimal information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReGuLaR significantly outperforms existing latent reasoning methods across both computational efficiency and reasoning effectiveness, and even surpasses CoT through multi-modal reasoning, providing a new and insightful solution to latent reasoning.

      <title>Deep Search with Hierarchical Meta-Cognitive Monitoring Inspired by Cognitive Neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep search agents powered by large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in multi-step retrieval, reasoning, and long-horizon task execution. However, their practical failures often stem from the lack of mechanisms to monitor and regulate reasoning and retrieval states as tasks evolve under uncertainty. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that human metacognition is hierarchically organized, integrating fast anomaly detection with selectively triggered, experience-driven reflection. In this work, we propose Deep Search with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (DS-MCM), a deep search framework augmented with an explicit hierarchical metacognitive monitoring mechanism. DS-MCM integrates a Fast Consistency Monitor, which performs lightweight checks on the alignment between external evidence and internal reasoning confidence, and a Slow Experience-Driven Monitor, which is selectively activated to guide corrective intervention based on experience memory from historical agent trajectories. By embedding monitoring directly into the reasoning-retrieval loop, DS-MCM determines both when intervention is warranted and how corrective actions should be informed by prior experience. Experiments across multiple deep search benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that DS-MCM consistently improves performance and robustness.</description>

      <title>Are you going to finish that? A Practical Study of the Tokenization Boundary Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are trained over sequences of tokens, whereas users interact with LMs via text. This mismatch gives rise to the partial token problem, which occurs when a user ends their prompt in the middle of the expected next-token, leading to distorted next-token predictions. Although this issue has been studied using arbitrary character prefixes, its prevalence and severity in realistic prompts respecting word boundaries remains underexplored. In this work, we identify three domains where token and "word" boundaries often do not line up: languages that do not use whitespace, highly compounding languages, and code. In Chinese, for example, up to 25% of word boundaries do not line up with token boundaries, making even natural, word-complete prompts susceptible to this problem. We systematically construct semantically natural prompts ending with a partial tokens; in experiments, we find that they comprise a serious failure mode: frontier LMs consistently place three orders of magnitude less probability on the correct continuation compared to when the prompt is "backed-off" to be token-aligned. This degradation does not diminish with scale and often worsens for larger models. Finally, we evaluate inference-time mitigations to the partial token problem and validate the effectiveness of recent exact solutions. Overall, we demonstrate the scale and severity of probability distortion caused by tokenization in realistic use cases, and provide practical recommentions for model inference providers.</description>

      <title>Now You Hear Me: Audio Narrative Attacks Against Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large audio-language models increasingly operate on raw speech inputs, enabling more seamless integration across domains such as voice assistants, education, and clinical triage. This transition, however, introduces a distinct class of vulnerabilities that remain largely uncharacterized. We examine the security implications of this modality shift by designing a text-to-audio jailbreak that embeds disallowed directives within a narrative-style audio stream. The attack leverages an advanced instruction-following text-to-speech (TTS) model to exploit structural and acoustic properties, thereby circumventing safety mechanisms primarily calibrated for text. When delivered through synthetic speech, the narrative format elicits restricted outputs from state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving a 98.26% success rate that substantially exceeds text-only baselines. These results highlight the need for safety frameworks that jointly reason over linguistic and paralinguistic representations, particularly as speech-based interfaces become more prevalent.</description>

      <title>PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid advances in autonomous AI scientists powered by language models, generating publication-ready illustrations remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in the research workflow. To lift this burden, we introduce PaperBanana, an agentic framework for automated generation of publication-ready academic illustrations. Powered by state-of-the-art VLMs and image generation models, PaperBanana orchestrates specialized agents to retrieve references, plan content and style, render images, and iteratively refine via self-critique. To rigorously evaluate our framework, we introduce PaperBananaBench, comprising 292 test cases for methodology diagrams curated from NeurIPS 2025 publications, covering diverse research domains and illustration styles. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PaperBanana consistently outperforms leading baselines in faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics. We further show that our method effectively extends to the generation of high-quality statistical plots. Collectively, PaperBanana paves the way for the automated generation of publication-ready illustrations.</description>

      <title>UPA: Unsupervised Prompt Agent via Tree-Based Search and Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt agents have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for automated prompt optimization, framing refinement as a sequential decision-making problem over a structured prompt space. While this formulation enables the use of advanced planning algorithms, these methods typically assume access to supervised reward signals, which are often unavailable in practical scenarios. In this work, we propose UPA, an Unsupervised Prompt Agent that realizes structured search and selection without relying on supervised feedback. Specifically, during search, UPA iteratively constructs an evolving tree structure to navigate the prompt space, guided by fine-grained and order-invariant pairwise comparisons from Large Language Models (LLMs). Crucially, as these local comparisons do not inherently yield a consistent global scale, we decouple systematic prompt exploration from final selection, introducing a two-stage framework grounded in the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model. This framework first performs path-wise Bayesian aggregation of local comparisons to filter candidates under uncertainty, followed by global tournament-style comparisons to infer latent prompt quality and identify the optimal prompt. Experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that UPA consistently outperforms existing prompt optimization methods, showing that agent-style optimization remains highly effective even in fully unsupervised settings.</description>

      <title>UniFinEval: Towards Unified Evaluation of Financial Multimodal Models across Text, Images and Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models are playing an increasingly significant role in empowering the financial domain, however, the challenges they face, such as multimodal and high-density information and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, go beyond the evaluation scope of existing multimodal benchmarks. To address this gap, we propose UniFinEval, the first unified multimodal benchmark designed for high-information-density financial environments, covering text, images, and videos. UniFinEval systematically constructs five core financial scenarios grounded in real-world financial systems: Financial Statement Auditing, Company Fundamental Reasoning, Industry Trend Insights, Financial Risk Sensing, and Asset Allocation Analysis. We manually construct a high-quality dataset consisting of 3,767 question-answer pairs in both chinese and english and systematically evaluate 10 mainstream MLLMs under Zero-Shot and CoT settings. Results show that Gemini-3-pro-preview achieves the best overall performance, yet still exhibits a substantial gap compared to financial experts. Further error analysis reveals systematic deficiencies in current models. UniFinEval aims to provide a systematic assessment of MLLMs' capabilities in fine-grained, high-information-density financial environments, thereby enhancing the robustness of MLLMs applications in real-world financial scenarios. Data and code are available at https://github.com/aifinlab/UniFinEval.</description>

      <title>Lost in Space? Vision-Language Models Struggle with Relative Camera Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well in 2D perception and semantic reasoning compared to their limited understanding of 3D spatial structure. We investigate this gap using relative camera pose estimation (RCPE), a fundamental vision task that requires inferring relative camera translation and rotation from a pair of images. We introduce VRRPI-Bench, a benchmark derived from unlabeled egocentric videos with verbalized annotations of relative camera motion, reflecting realistic scenarios with simultaneous translation and rotation around a shared object. We further propose VRRPI-Diag, a diagnostic benchmark that isolates individual motion degrees of freedom. Despite the simplicity of RCPE, most VLMs fail to generalize beyond shallow 2D heuristics, particularly for depth changes and roll transformations along the optical axis. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 ($0.64$) fall short of classic geometric baselines ($0.97$) and human performance ($0.92$). Moreover, VLMs exhibit difficulty in multi-image reasoning, with inconsistent performance (best $59.7\%$) when integrating spatial cues across frames. Our findings reveal limitations in grounding VLMs in 3D and multi-view spatial reasoning.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Literature Review on LLM Defenses Against Prompt Injection and Jailbreaking: Expanding NIST Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied by the emergence of new security vulnerabilities and challenges, such as jailbreaking and other prompt injection attacks. These maliciously crafted inputs can exploit LLMs, causing data leaks, unauthorized actions, or compromised outputs, for instance. As both offensive and defensive prompt injection techniques evolve quickly, a structured understanding of mitigation strategies becomes increasingly important. To address that, this work presents the first systematic literature review on prompt injection mitigation strategies, comprehending 88 studies. Building upon NIST's report on adversarial machine learning, this work contributes to the field through several avenues. First, it identifies studies beyond those documented in NIST's report and other academic reviews and surveys. Second, we propose an extension to NIST taxonomy by introducing additional categories of defenses. Third, by adopting NIST's established terminology and taxonomy as a foundation, we promote consistency and enable future researchers to build upon the standardized taxonomy proposed in this work. Finally, we provide a comprehensive catalog of the reviewed prompt injection defenses, documenting their reported quantitative effectiveness across specific LLMs and attack datasets, while also indicating which solutions are open-source and model-agnostic. This catalog, together with the guidelines presented herein, aims to serve as a practical resource for researchers advancing the field of adversarial machine learning and for developers seeking to implement effective defenses in production systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting Intermittent Job Failure Categories for Diagnosis Using Few-Shot Fine-Tuned Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In principle, Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline failures provide valuable feedback to developers on code-related errors. In practice, however, pipeline jobs often fail intermittently due to non-deterministic tests, network outages, infrastructure failures, resource exhaustion, and other reliability issues. These intermittent (flaky) job failures lead to substantial inefficiencies: wasted computational resources from repeated reruns and significant diagnosis time that distracts developers from core activities and often requires intervention from specialized teams. Prior work has proposed machine learning techniques to detect intermittent failures, but does not address the subsequent diagnosis challenge. To fill this gap, we introduce FlaXifyer, a few-shot learning approach for predicting intermittent job failure categories using pre-trained language models. FlaXifyer requires only job execution logs and achieves 84.3% Macro F1 and 92.0% Top-2 accuracy with just 12 labeled examples per category. We also propose LogSift, an interpretability technique that identifies influential log statements in under one second, reducing review effort by 74.4% while surfacing relevant failure information in 87% of cases. Evaluation on 2,458 job failures from TELUS demonstrates that FlaXifyer and LogSift enable effective automated triage, accelerate failure diagnosis, and pave the way towards the automated resolution of intermittent job failures.</description>

      <title>JAF: Judge Agent Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Judge agents are fundamental to agentic AI frameworks: they provide automated evaluation, and enable iterative self-refinement of reasoning processes. We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.
  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.
  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths. We validate JAF with an empirical study on the demanding task of cloud misconfigs triage in large-scale cloud environments.</description>

      <title>Sylber 2.0: A Universal Syllable Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling spoken language modeling requires speech tokens that are both efficient and universal. Recent work has proposed syllables as promising speech tokens at low temporal resolution, but existing models are constrained to English and fail to capture sufficient acoustic detail. To address this gap, we present Sylber 2.0, a self-supervised framework for coding speech at the syllable level that enables efficient temporal compression and high-fidelity reconstruction. Sylber 2.0 achieves a very low token frequency around 5 Hz, while retaining both linguistic and acoustic detail across multiple languages and expressive styles. Experiments show that it performs on par with previous models operating on high-frequency baselines. Furthermore, Sylber 2.0 enables efficient TTS modeling which can generate speech with competitive intelligibility and quality with SOTA models using only 72M parameters. Moreover, the universality of Sylber 2.0 provides more effective features for low resource ASR than previous speech coding frameworks. In sum, we establish an effective syllable-level abstraction for general spoken language.</description>

      <title>Why Reasoning Fails to Plan: A Planning-Centric Analysis of Long-Horizon Decision Making in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents exhibit strong step-by-step reasoning capabilities over short horizons, yet often fail to sustain coherent behavior over long planning horizons. We argue that this failure reflects a fundamental mismatch: step-wise reasoning induces a form of step-wise greedy policy that is adequate for short horizons but fails in long-horizon planning, where early actions must account for delayed consequences. From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning. These results establish a clear distinction between reasoning and planning.</description>

      <title>ReNCE: Learning to Reason by Noise Contrastive Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRPO is a standard approach to endowing pretrained LLMs with reasoning capabilities. It estimates the advantage of an outcome from a group of $K$ outcomes, and promotes those with positive advantages inside a trust region. Since GRPO discriminates between good and bad outcomes softly, it benefits from additional refinements such as asymmetric clipping and zero-variance data filtering. While effective, these refinements require significant empirical insight and can be challenging to identify. We instead propose an explicit contrastive learning approach. Instead of estimating advantages, we bifurcate $K$ outcomes into positive and negative sets, then maximize the likelihood of positive outcomes. Our approach can be viewed as an online instantiation of (multi-label) noise contrastive estimation for LLM reasoning. We validate our method by demonstrating competitive performance on a suite of challenging math benchmarks against strong baselines such as DAPO and online DPO.</description>

      <title>Towards Resiliency in Large Language Model Serving with KevlarFlow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems remain fundamentally fragile, where frequent hardware faults in hyperscale clusters trigger disproportionate service outages in the software stack. Current recovery mechanisms are prohibitively slow, often requiring up to 10 minutes to reinitialize resources and reload massive model weights. We introduce KevlarFlow, a fault tolerant serving architecture designed to bridge the gap between hardware unreliability and service availability. KevlarFlow leverages 1) decoupled model parallelism initialization, 2) dynamic traffic rerouting, and 3) background KV cache replication to maintain high throughput during partial failures. Our evaluation demonstrates that KevlarFlow reduces mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) by 20x and, under failure conditions, improves average latency by 3.1x, 99th percentile (p99) latency by 2.8x, average time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 378.9x, and p99 TTFT by 574.6x with negligible runtime overhead in comparison to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems.</description>

      <title>AI and My Values: User Perceptions of LLMs' Ability to Extract, Embody, and Explain Human Values from Casual Conversations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Does AI understand human values? While this remains an open philosophical question, we take a pragmatic stance by introducing VAPT, the Value-Alignment Perception Toolkit, for studying how LLMs reflect people's values and how people judge those reflections. 20 participants texted a human-like chatbot over a month, then completed a 2-hour interview with our toolkit evaluating AI's ability to extract (pull details regarding), embody (make decisions guided by), and explain (provide proof of) human values. 13 participants left our study convinced that AI can understand human values. Participants found the experience insightful for self-reflection and found themselves getting persuaded by the AI's reasoning. Thus, we warn about "weaponized empathy": a potentially dangerous design pattern that may arise in value-aligned, yet welfare-misaligned AI. VAPT offers concrete artifacts and design implications to evaluate and responsibly build value-aligned conversational agents with transparency, consent, and safeguards as AI grows more capable and human-like into the future.</description>

      <title>HeaPA: Difficulty-Aware Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation for LLM Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RLVR is now a standard way to train LLMs on reasoning tasks with verifiable outcomes, but when rollout generation dominates the cost, efficiency depends heavily on which prompts you sample and when. In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

      <title>FraudShield: Knowledge Graph Empowered Defense for LLMs against Fraud Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into critical automated workflows, including contract review and job application processes. However, LLMs are susceptible to manipulation by fraudulent information, which can lead to harmful outcomes. Although advanced defense methods have been developed to address this issue, they often exhibit limitations in effectiveness, interpretability, and generalizability, particularly when applied to LLM-based applications. To address these challenges, we introduce FraudShield, a novel framework designed to protect LLMs from fraudulent content by leveraging a comprehensive analysis of fraud tactics. Specifically, FraudShield constructs and refines a fraud tactic-keyword knowledge graph to capture high-confidence associations between suspicious text and fraud techniques. The structured knowledge graph augments the original input by highlighting keywords and providing supporting evidence, guiding the LLM toward more secure responses. Extensive experiments show that FraudShield consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses across four mainstream LLMs and five representative fraud types, while also offering interpretable clues for the model's generations.</description>

      <title>PhoStream: Benchmarking Real-World Streaming for Omnimodal Assistants in Mobile Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel at offline audio-visual understanding, but their ability to serve as mobile assistants in continuous real-world streams remains underexplored. In daily phone use, mobile assistants must track streaming audio-visual inputs and respond at the right time, yet existing benchmarks are often restricted to multiple-choice questions or use shorter videos. In this paper, we introduce PhoStream, the first mobile-centric streaming benchmark that unifies on-screen and off-screen scenarios to evaluate video, audio, and temporal reasoning. PhoStream contains 5,572 open-ended QA pairs from 578 videos across 4 scenarios and 10 capabilities. We build it with an Automated Generative Pipeline backed by rigorous human verification, and evaluate models using a realistic Online Inference Pipeline and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation for open-ended responses. Experiments reveal a temporal asymmetry in LLM-judged scores (0-100): models perform well on Instant and Backward tasks (Gemini 3 Pro exceeds 80), but drop sharply on Forward tasks (16.40), largely due to early responses before the required visual and audio cues appear. This highlights a fundamental limitation: current MLLMs struggle to decide when to speak, not just what to say. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/PhoStream.</description>

      <title>TimeMachine-bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Model Capabilities in Repository-Level Migration Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of automated software engineering, research focus is increasingly shifting toward practical tasks reflecting the day-to-day work of software engineers. Among these tasks, software migration, a critical process of adapting code to evolving environments, has been largely overlooked. In this study, we introduce TimeMachine-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate software migration in real-world Python projects. Our benchmark consists of GitHub repositories whose tests begin to fail in response to dependency updates. The construction process is fully automated, enabling live updates of the benchmark. Furthermore, we curated a human-verified subset to ensure problem solvability. We evaluated agent-based baselines built on top of 11 models, including both strong open-weight and state-of-the-art LLMs on this verified subset. Our results indicated that, while LLMs show some promise for migration tasks, they continue to face substantial reliability challenges, including spurious solutions that exploit low test coverage and unnecessary edits stemming from suboptimal tool-use strategies. Our dataset and implementation are available at https://github.com/tohoku-nlp/timemachine-bench.</description>

      <title>From Self-Evolving Synthetic Data to Verifiable-Reward RL: Post-Training Multi-turn Interactive Tool-Using Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive tool-using agents must solve real-world tasks via multi-turn interaction with both humans and external environments, requiring dialogue state tracking, multi-step tool execution, while following complex instructions. Post-training such agents is challenging because synthesis for high-quality multi-turn tool-use data is difficult to scale, and reinforcement learning (RL) could face noisy signals caused by user simulation, leading to degraded training efficiency. We propose a unified framework that combines a self-evolving data agent with verifier-based RL. Our system, EigenData, is a hierarchical multi-agent engine that synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues together with executable per-instance checkers, and improves generation reliability via closed-loop self-evolving process that updates prompts and workflow. Building on the synthetic data, we develop an RL recipe that first fine-tunes the user model and then applies GRPO-style training with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering, yielding consistent improvements beyond SFT. Evaluated on tau^2-bench, our best model reaches 73.0% pass^1 on Airline and 98.3% pass^1 on Telecom, matching or exceeding frontier models. Overall, our results suggest a scalable pathway for bootstrapping complex tool-using behaviors without expensive human annotation.</description>

      <title>TTCS: Test-Time Curriculum Synthesis for Self-Evolving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-Time Training offers a promising way to improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by adapting the model using only the test questions. However, existing methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems for two reasons: raw test questions are often too difficult to yield high-quality pseudo-labels, and the limited size of test sets makes continuous online updates prone to instability. To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving. Our code and implementation details are available at https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/TTCS.</description>

      <title>A Unified Study of LoRA Variants: Taxonomy, Review, Codebase, and Empirical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a fundamental parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that balances efficiency and performance in large-scale neural networks. However, the proliferation of LoRA variants has led to fragmentation in methodology, theory, code, and evaluation. To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters. Our results uncover several findings, notably: LoRA and its variants exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the choices of learning rate compared to other hyperparameters; moreover, with proper hyperparameter configurations, LoRA consistently matches or surpasses the performance of most of its variants.</description>

      <title>AlienLM: Alienization of Language for API-Boundary Privacy in Black-Box LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly accessed via black-box APIs, requiring users to transmit sensitive prompts, outputs, and fine-tuning data to external providers, creating a critical privacy risk at the API boundary. We introduce AlienLM, a deployable API-only privacy layer that protects text by translating it into an Alien Language via a vocabulary-scale bijection, enabling lossless recovery on the client side. Using only standard fine-tuning APIs, Alien Adaptation Training (AAT) adapts target models to operate directly on alienized inputs. Across four LLM backbones and seven benchmarks, AlienLM retains over 81\% of plaintext-oracle performance on average, substantially outperforming random-bijection and character-level baselines. Under adversaries with access to model weights, corpus statistics, and learning-based inverse translation, recovery attacks reconstruct fewer than 0.22\% of alienized tokens. Our results demonstrate a practical pathway for privacy-preserving LLM deployment under API-only access, substantially reducing plaintext exposure while maintaining task performance.</description>

      <title>CALM: Joint Contextual Acoustic-Linguistic Modeling for Personalization of Multi-Speaker ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CALM, a joint Contextual Acoustic-Linguistic Modeling framework for multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR). In personalized AI scenarios, the joint availability of acoustic and linguistic cues naturally motivates the integration of target-speaker conditioning with contextual biasing in overlapping conversations. CALM implements this integration in an end-to-end framework through speaker embedding-driven target-speaker extraction and dynamic vocabulary-based contextual biasing. We evaluate CALM on simulated English (LibriSpeechMix) and Japanese (Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese mixtures, CSJMix). On two-speaker mixtures, CALM reduces biased word error rate (B-WER) from 12.7 to 4.7 on LibriSpeech2Mix and biased character error rate (B-CER) from 16.6 to 8.4 on CSJMix2 (eval3), demonstrating the effectiveness of joint acoustic-linguistic modeling across languages. We additionally report results on the AMI corpus (IHM-mix condition) to validate performance on standardized speech mixtures.</description>

      <title>SOMBRERO: Measuring and Steering Boundary Placement in End-to-End Hierarchical Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical sequence models replace fixed tokenization with learned segmentations that compress long byte sequences for efficient autoregressive modeling. While recent end-to-end methods can learn meaningful boundaries from the language-modeling objective alone, it remains difficult to quantitatively assess and systematically steer where compute is spent. We introduce a router-agnostic metric of boundary quality, boundary enrichment B, which measures how strongly chunk starts concentrate on positions with high next-byte surprisal. Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions.</description>

      <title>Eroding the Truth-Default: A Causal Analysis of Human Susceptibility to Foundation Model Hallucinations and Disinformation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As foundation models (FMs) approach human-level fluency, distinguishing synthetic from organic content has become a key challenge for Trustworthy Web Intelligence.
  This paper presents JudgeGPT and RogueGPT, a dual-axis framework that decouples "authenticity" from "attribution" to investigate the mechanisms of human susceptibility. Analyzing 918 evaluations across five FMs (including GPT-4 and Llama-2), we employ Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as a principal framework for formulating testable causal hypotheses about detection accuracy.
  Contrary to partisan narratives, we find that political orientation shows a negligible association with detection performance ($r=-0.10$). Instead, "fake news familiarity" emerges as a candidate mediator ($r=0.35$), suggesting that exposure may function as adversarial training for human discriminators. We identify a "fluency trap" where GPT-4 outputs (HumanMachineScore: 0.20) bypass Source Monitoring mechanisms, rendering them indistinguishable from human text.
  These findings suggest that "pre-bunking" interventions should target cognitive source monitoring rather than demographic segmentation to ensure trustworthy information ecosystems.</description>

      <title>EmoShift: Lightweight Activation Steering for Enhanced Emotion-Aware Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise and controllable emotional expression is crucial for producing natural and context-appropriate speech in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. However, many emotion-aware TTS systems, including large language model (LLM)-based designs, rely on scaling fixed emotion embeddings or external guidance, limiting their ability to model emotion-specific latent characteristics. To address this gap, we present EmoShift, a lightweight activation-steering framework incorporating a EmoSteer layer, which learns a steering vector for each target emotion in the output embedding space to capture its latent offset and maintain stable, appropriate expression across utterances and categories. With only 10M trainable parameters,less than 1/30 of full fine-tuning, EmoShift outperforms zero-shot and fully fine-tuned baselines in objective and subjective evaluations, enhancing emotional expressiveness while preserving naturalness and speaker similarity. Further analysis confirms the proposed EmoSteer layer's effectiveness and reveals its potential for controllable emotional intensity in speech synthesis.</description>

      <title>MoVE: Mixture of Value Embeddings -- A New Axis for Scaling Parametric Memory in Autoregressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive sequence modeling stands as the cornerstone of modern Generative AI, powering results across diverse modalities ranging from text generation to image generation. However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation. In both domains, MoVE yields consistent performance improvements over standard and layer-wise memory baselines, enabling the construction of "memory-dense" models that achieve lower perplexity and higher fidelity than their dense counterparts at comparable compute budgets.</description>

      <title>Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image embeddings are generally assumed to pose limited privacy risk. We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1</description>

      <title>Perplexity Cannot Always Tell Right from Wrong</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perplexity -- a function measuring a model's overall level of "surprise" when encountering a particular output -- has gained significant traction in recent years, both as a loss function and as a simple-to-compute metric of model quality. Prior studies have pointed out several limitations of perplexity, often from an empirical manner. Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected.</description>

      <title>MiTa: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework with Memory-integrated and Task Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have substantially accelerated the development of embodied agents. LLM-based multi-agent systems mitigate the inefficiency of single agents in complex tasks. However, they still suffer from issues such as memory inconsistency and agent behavioral conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MiTa, a hierarchical memory-integrated task allocative framework to enhance collaborative efficiency. MiTa organizes agents into a manager-member hierarchy, where the manager incorporates additional allocation and summary modules that enable (1) global task allocation and (2) episodic memory integration. The allocation module enables the manager to allocate tasks from a global perspective, thereby avoiding potential inter-agent conflicts. The summary module, triggered by task progress updates, performs episodic memory integration by condensing recent collaboration history into a concise summary that preserves long-horizon context. By combining task allocation with episodic memory, MiTa attains a clearer understanding of the task and facilitates globally consistent task distribution. Experimental results confirm that MiTa achieves superior efficiency and adaptability in complex multi-agent cooperation over strong baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Learnable Permutation for Structured Sparsity on Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured sparsity has emerged as a popular model pruning technique, widely adopted in various architectures, including CNNs, Transformer models, and especially large language models (LLMs) in recent years. A promising direction to further improve post-pruning performance is weight permutation, which reorders model weights into patterns more amenable to pruning. However, the exponential growth of the permutation search space with the scale of Transformer architectures forces most methods to rely on greedy or heuristic algorithms, limiting the effectiveness of reordering.
  In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable permutation framework. Our method introduces a learnable permutation cost matrix to quantify the cost of swapping any two input channels of a given weight matrix, a differentiable bipartite matching solver to obtain the optimal binary permutation matrix given a cost matrix, and a sparsity optimization loss function to directly optimize the permutation operator. We extensively validate our approach on vision and language Transformers, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art permutation results for structured sparsity.</description>

      <title>Mem-T: Densifying Rewards for Long-Horizon Memory Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory agents, which depart from predefined memory-processing pipelines by endogenously managing the processing, storage, and retrieval of memories, have garnered increasing attention for their autonomy and adaptability. However, existing training paradigms remain constrained: agents often traverse long-horizon sequences of memory operations before receiving sparse and delayed rewards, which hinders truly end-to-end optimization of memory management policies. To address this limitation, we introduce Mem-T, an autonomous memory agent that interfaces with a lightweight hierarchical memory database to perform dynamic updates and multi-turn retrieval over streaming inputs. To effectively train long-horizon memory management capabilities, we further propose MoT-GRPO, a tree-guided reinforcement learning framework that transforms sparse terminal feedback into dense, step-wise supervision via memory operation tree backpropagation and hindsight credit assignment, thereby enabling the joint optimization of memory construction and retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mem-T is (1) high-performing, surpassing frameworks such as A-Mem and Mem0 by up to $14.92\%$, and (2) economical, operating on a favorable accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier and reducing inference tokens per query by $\sim24.45\%$ relative to GAM without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>DIFFA-2: A Practical Diffusion Large Language Model for General Audio Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large audio language models (LALMs) such as Qwen-2.5-Omni have achieved strong performance on audio understanding and interaction, but scaling them remains costly in data and computation, and strictly sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently been shown to make effective use of limited training data, and prior work on DIFFA indicates that replacing an AR backbone with a diffusion counterpart can substantially improve audio understanding under matched settings, albeit at a proof-of-concept scale without large-scale instruction tuning, preference alignment, or practical decoding schemes. We introduce DIFFA-2, a practical diffusion-based LALM for general audio understanding. DIFFA-2 upgrades the speech encoder, employs dual semantic and acoustic adapters, and is trained with a four-stage curriculum that combines semantic and acoustic alignment, large-scale supervised fine-tuning, and variance-reduced preference optimization, using only fully open-source corpora. Experiments on MMSU, MMAU, and MMAR show that DIFFA-2 consistently improves over DIFFA and is competitive to strong AR LALMs under practical training budgets, supporting diffusion-based modeling is a viable backbone for large-scale audio understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/DIFFA.git.</description>

      <title>Scaling Multiagent Systems with Process Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While multiagent systems have shown promise for tackling complex tasks via specialization, finetuning multiple agents simultaneously faces two key challenges: (1) credit assignment across agents, and (2) sample efficiency of expensive multiagent rollouts. In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Language Identification and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works on language identification and generation have established tight statistical rates at which these tasks can be achieved. These works typically operate under a strong realizability assumption: that the input data is drawn from an unknown distribution necessarily supported on some language in a given collection. In this work, we relax this assumption of realizability entirely, and impose no restrictions on the distribution of the input data. We propose objectives to study both language identification and generation in this more general "agnostic" setup. Across both problems, we obtain novel interesting characterizations and nearly tight rates.</description>

      <title>FOCUS: DLLMs Know How to Tame Their Compute Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) offer a compelling alternative to Auto-Regressive models, but their deployment is constrained by high decoding cost. In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks. The FOCUS system is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/sands-lab/FOCUS.</description>

      <title>OMGEval: An Open Multilingual Generative Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) should generally benefit individuals from various cultural backgrounds around the world. However, most recent advanced generative evaluation benchmarks tailed for LLMs mainly focus on English. To this end, we introduce OMGEval, the first Open-source Multilingual Generative test set that can assess the capability of LLMs in different languages. For each language, OMGEval provides 804 open-ended questions, covering a wide range of important capabilities of LLMs, such as general knowledge, logical reasoning, and so on. Each question is rigorously verified by human annotators. Notably, to sufficiently reflect the compatibility of LLMs in different cultural backgrounds, we perform localization for each non-English language. Specifically, the current version of OMGEval includes 5 languages (i.e., Zh, Ru, Fr, Es, Ar). Following AlpacaEval, we employ GPT-4 as the adjudicator to automatically score different model outputs, which is shown closely related to human evaluation. We evaluate several representative multilingual LLMs on the proposed OMGEval, which we believe will provide a valuable reference for the community to further understand and improve the multilingual capability of LLMs. OMGEval is available at https://github.com/blcuicall/OMGEval.</description>

      <title>Strengthening False Information Propagation Detection: Leveraging SVM and Sophisticated Text Vectorization Techniques in comparison to BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation, particularly through online platforms, underscores the urgent need for reliable detection systems. This study explores the utilization of machine learning and natural language processing, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and BERT, to detect fake news. We employ three distinct text vectorization methods for SVM: Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, and Bag of Words (BoW), evaluating their effectiveness in distinguishing between genuine and fake news. Additionally, we compare these methods against the transformer large language model, BERT. Our comprehensive approach includes detailed preprocessing steps, rigorous model implementation, and thorough evaluation to determine the most effective techniques. The results demonstrate that while BERT achieves superior accuracy with 99.98% and an F1-score of 0.9998, the SVM model with a linear kernel and BoW vectorization also performs exceptionally well, achieving 99.81% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9980. These findings highlight that, despite BERT's superior performance, SVM models with BoW and TF-IDF vectorization methods come remarkably close, offering highly competitive performance with the advantage of lower computational requirements.</description>

      <title>Softplus Attention with Re-weighting Boosts Length Extrapolation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13428v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in recent years, primarily due to self-attention. However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the number of inference tokens increases. This work addresses these issues by proposing a new design principle for attention, viewing it as a two-stage process. The first stage (normalisation) refines standard attention by replacing Softmax with the more numerically stable Softplus followed by $l_{1}$-normalisation. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic scale factor based on invariance entropy. We show that this novel attention mechanism outperforms conventional Softmax attention, and state-of-the-art Softmax-free alternatives. Our second proposal is to introduce a second processing stage (sharpening) which consists of a re-weighting mechanism that amplifies significant attentional weights while diminishing weaker ones. This enables the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens, mitigating the attention sink phenomenon, and fundamentally improving length extrapolation. This novel, two-stage, replacement for self-attention is shown to ensure numerical stability and dramatically improve length extrapolation, maintaining a nearly constant validation loss at 16$\times$ the training length while achieving superior results on challenging long-context retrieval tasks and downstream benchmarks. Furthermore, symbolic regression experiments demonstrate that our method enables models to recover Newton's gravitational law from orbital trajectory sequences, providing evidence that appropriate attention mechanisms are crucial for foundation models to develop genuine physical world models.</description>

      <title>DeepGreen: Effective LLM-Driven Greenwashing Monitoring System Designed for Empirical Testing -- Evidence from China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the emerging adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in economics and management research, this paper investigates whether LLMs can reliably identify corporate greenwashing narratives and, more importantly, whether and how the greenwashing signals extracted from textual disclosures can be used to empirically identify causal effects. To this end, this paper proposes DeepGreen, a dual-stage LLM-Driven system for detecting potential corporate greenwashing in annual reports. Applied to 9369 A-share annual reports published between 2021 and 2023, DeepGreen attains high reliability in random-sample validation at both stages. Ablation experiment shows that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) reduces hallucinations, as compared to simply lengthening the input window. Empirical tests indicate that "greenwashing" captured by DeepGreen can effectively reveal a positive relationship between greenwashing and environmental penalties, and IV, PSM, Placebo test, which enhance the robustness and causal effects of the empirical evidence. Further study suggests that the presence and number of green investors can weaken the positive correlation between greenwashing and penalties. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the positive relationship between "greenwashing - penalty" is less significant in large-sized corporations and corporations that have accumulated green assets, indicating that these green assets may be exploited as a credibility shield for greenwashing. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can standardize ESG oversight by early warning and direct regulators' scarce attention toward the subsets of corporations where monitoring is more warranted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can answer prompts in many languages, despite being trained predominantly on English; yet, the mechanisms driving this generalization remain poorly understood. This work asks: How does an LLM's ability to align representations of non-English inputs to English impact its performance on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks? We study the role of representation alignment in instance-level task decisions, complementing prior analyses conducted both at the language level and task-independently. We introduce the Discriminative Alignment Index ($\DALI$) to quantify instance-level alignment across 24 languages other than English and three distinct NLU tasks. Results show that incorrect NLU predictions are strongly associated with lower representation alignment with English in the model's middle layers. Through activation patching, we show that incorrect predictions in languages other than English can be fixed by patching their parallel English activations in the middle layers, thereby demonstrating the causal role of representation (mis)alignment in cross-lingual correctness.</description>

      <title>What Matters in Linearizing Language Models? A Comparative Study of Architecture, Scale, and Task Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearization has emerged as a strategy for developing efficient language models (LMs). Starting from an existing Transformer-based LM, linearization replaces the attention component with computationally efficient subquadratic \textit{token mixers}. However, as an increasing number of mixers are proposed, it remains unclear which inductive biases are best suited to inherit the original Transformer's capabilities. Furthermore, it is unknown how linearization is affected by parameter and token budget scaling. To address these questions, we propose a unified setup to compare seven representative architectures, including xLSTM, GLA, and Gated DeltaNet. Our findings reveal that performance hierarchies remain stable from 140M to 1.7B parameters, with error-correcting update rules demonstrating superior scaling exponents. We show that performance gaps are established early and persist through asymptotic maturity at 10B tokens, suggesting that state resolution is a more fundamental bottleneck than the distillation budget. Finally, while most models adapt to instruction tuning, only gated delta-rule formulations maintain the precision necessary for long-context retrieval, whereas additive models suffer from irreversible state saturation. These results suggest that for successful linearization, architectural inductive biases remain the primary constraint that cannot be overcome by simply scaling training compute.</description>

      <title>SuperCoder: Assembly Program Superoptimization with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superoptimization is the task of transforming a program into a faster one while preserving its input-output behavior. In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as superoptimizers, generating assembly programs that outperform code already optimized by industry-standard compilers. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for this problem, consisting of 8,072 assembly programs averaging 130 lines, in contrast to prior datasets restricted to 2-15 straight-line, loop-free programs. We evaluate 23 LLMs on this benchmark and find that the strongest baseline, Claude-opus-4, achieves a 51.5% test-passing rate and a 1.43x average speedup over gcc -O3. To further enhance performance, we fine-tune models with reinforcement learning, optimizing a reward function that integrates correctness and performance speedup. Starting from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (61.4% correctness, 1.10x speedup), the fine-tuned model SuperCoder attains 95.0% correctness and 1.46x average speedup, with additional improvement enabled by Best-of-N sampling and iterative refinement. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that LLMs can be applied as superoptimizers for assembly programs, establishing a foundation for future research in program performance optimization beyond compiler heuristics.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic evaluation of Transformers and state space models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State space models (SSMs) for language modelling promise an efficient and performant alternative to quadratic-attention Transformers, yet show variable performance on recalling basic information from the context. While performance on synthetic tasks like Associative Recall (AR) can point to this deficiency, behavioural metrics provide little information as to \textit{why} -- on a mechanistic level -- certain architectures fail and others succeed. To address this, we conduct experiments on AR, and find that only Transformers and Based SSM models fully succeed at AR, with Mamba and DeltaNet close behind, while the other SSMs (H3, Hyena) fail. We then use causal interventions to explain why. We find that Transformers and Based learn to store key-value associations in-context using induction. By contrast, the SSMs seem to compute these associations only at the last state using a single layer. We further investigate the mechanism underlying the success of Mamba, and find novel evidence that Mamba \textit{does} implement induction: not via the SSM, but instead via short convolutions. Further experiments on a new hierarchical retrieval task, Associative Treecall (ATR), show that all architectures learn the same mechanism as they did for AR. Furthermore, we show that Mamba can learn Attention-like induction on ATR when short convolutions are removed. These results reveal that architectures with similar accuracy may still have substantive differences, motivating the adoption of mechanistic evaluations.</description>

      <title>Diverse, not Short: A Length-Controlled Data Selection Strategy for Improving Response Diversity of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16245v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diverse language model responses are crucial for creative generation, open-ended tasks, and self-improvement training. We show that common diversity metrics, and even reward models used for preference optimization, systematically bias models toward shorter outputs, limiting expressiveness. To address this, we introduce Diverse, not Short (Diverse-NS), a length-controlled data selection strategy that improves response diversity while maintaining length parity. By generating and filtering preference data that balances diversity, quality, and length, Diverse-NS enables effective training using only 3,000 preference pairs. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B and the Olmo-2 family, Diverse-NS substantially enhances lexical and semantic diversity. We show consistent improvement in diversity with minor reduction or gains in response quality on four creative generation tasks: Divergent Associations, Persona Generation, Alternate Uses, and Creative Writing. Surprisingly, experiments with the Olmo-2 model family (7B, and 13B) show that smaller models like Olmo-2-7B can serve as effective "diversity teachers" for larger models. By explicitly addressing length bias, our method efficiently pushes models toward more diverse and expressive outputs.</description>

      <title>Just as Humans Need Vaccines, So Do Models: Model Immunization to Combat Falsehoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) reproduce misinformation by learning the linguistic patterns that make falsehoods persuasive, such as hedging, false presuppositions, and citation fabrication, rather than merely memorizing false facts. We propose model immunization: supervised fine-tuning on curated (false claim, correction) pairs injected as small "vaccine doses" (5-10\% of tokens) alongside truthful data. Unlike post-hoc filtering or preference-based alignment, immunization provides direct negative supervision on labeled falsehoods. Across four open-weight model families, immunization improves TruthfulQA accuracy by 12 points and misinformation rejection by 30 points with negligible capability loss. We outline design requirements, which includes, dosage, labeling, quarantine, diversity and call for standardized vaccine corpora and benchmarks that test generalization, making immunization a routine component of responsible LLM development</description>

      <title>Surrogate Signals from Format and Length: Reinforcement Learning for Solving Mathematical Problems without Ground Truth Answers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19439v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, with Reinforcement Learning (RL) playing a key role in adapting them to specific applications. In mathematical problem solving, however, the reliance on ground truth answers poses significant challenges due to their high collection cost and limited availability.
  This work explores the use of simple surrogate signals, format and length, to guide RL training. We find that early training is dominated by format learning, where structural feedback alone accounts for most performance gains. Incorporating length-based rewards further refines outputs by discouraging overly long or short responses, enabling a GRPO approach with format-length signals to approximate, and in some cases surpass, ground-truth-based optimization. For example, our method achieves 40.0% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model, and generalizes across different model sizes and series.
  Beyond practical efficiency, these findings provide an inspirational perspective on RL: rather than imparting new knowledge, RL primarily activates reasoning capabilities already embedded in pre-trained models. This insight suggests that lightweight, label-efficient strategies can complement pre-training to unlock LLMs' latent potential in reasoning-intensive tasks.</description>

      <title>Studying the Soupability of Documents in State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether hidden states from Structured State Space Models (SSMs) can be merged post hoc to support downstream reasoning. Inspired by model souping, we study document souping, a strategy where documents are encoded independently, and their representations are pooled, via simple operations like averaging, into a single context state. This approach enables modular encoding and reuse without reprocessing the full input for each query. We demonstrate that finetuned Mamba2 models with souped representations achieve competitive or superior performance across multi-hop QA, sparse retrieval, and long-document reasoning tasks compared to the standard monolithic encoding approach. For example, on the RACE and QuALITY benchmarks for long document question answering, this method substantially outperforms a traditional concatenation approach. Crucially, this modular design scales to hundreds of documents while delivering substantial savings in inference cost, unlocking new possibilities for large-scale corpus reasoning.</description>

      <title>Framing Political Bias in Multilingual LLMs Across Pakistani Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape public discourse, yet most evaluations of political and economic bias have focused on high-resource, Western languages and contexts. This leaves critical blind spots in low-resource, multilingual regions such as Pakistan, where linguistic identity is closely tied to political, religious, and regional ideologies. We present a systematic evaluation of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five Pakistani languages: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto, and Balochi. Our framework integrates a culturally adapted Political Compass Test (PCT) with multi-level framing analysis, capturing both ideological stance (economic/social axes) and stylistic framing (content, tone, emphasis). Prompts are aligned with 11 socio-political themes specific to the Pakistani context. Results show that while LLMs predominantly reflect liberal-left orientations consistent with Western training data, they exhibit more authoritarian framing in regional languages, highlighting language-conditioned ideological modulation. We also identify consistent model-specific bias patterns across languages. These findings show the need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing frameworks in global NLP.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Open-Schema Entity Structure Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results. To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing. Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to extract more complete entity structures across three different domains, showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity structure discovery in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs Stable Formal Logic Translators in Logical Reasoning Across Linguistically Diversified Texts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has received growing attention. One mainstream approach translates natural language into formal logic and then applies symbolic solvers for deduction. While effective in many tasks, these LLM-based translators often fail to generate consistent symbolic representations when the same concept appears in different linguistic forms. Such inconsistencies break logical coherence and lead to solver errors. However, most existing benchmarks lack this type of linguistic variation, which frequently occurs in real-world text, leaving the problem underexplored. To address this gap, we present SoLT, a benchmark that systematically rewrites reasoning datasets into diverse yet logically equivalent forms across multiple levels. Beyond evaluation, SoLT also provides a general method to enrich any dataset with linguistic diversity while preserving both meaning and logic. To further enhance the stability of LLM-based reasoning, we propose MenTaL, which explicitly guides models to build a concept-symbol mapping table during translation. By linking equivalent expressions to shared symbols, MenTaL maintains consistency and mitigates symbol drift. Experiments on SoLT demonstrate that LLMs indeed suffer from inconsistent symbol mapping under linguistic variation, leading to significant drops in reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, applying MenTaL brings clear and stable performance improvements across diverse inputs. Overall, our findings reveal that overlooking linguistic diversity hides key weaknesses in LLM-based translators, and our work offers a step toward more reliable logical reasoning in varied real-world scenarios.

      <title>Tokenization Multiplicity Leads to Arbitrary Price Variation in LLM-as-a-service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providers of LLM-as-a-service have predominantly adopted a simple pricing model: users pay a fixed price per token. Consequently, one may think that the price two different users would pay for the same output string under the same input prompt is the same. In our work, we show that, surprisingly, this is not (always) true. We find empirical evidence that, particularly for non-english outputs, both proprietary and open-weights LLMs often generate the same (output) string with multiple different tokenizations, even under the same input prompt, and this in turn leads to arbitrary price variation. To address the problem of tokenization multiplicity, we introduce canonical generation, a type of constrained generation that restricts LLMs to only generate canonical tokenizations -- the unique tokenization in which each string is tokenized during the training process of an LLM. Further, we introduce an efficient sampling algorithm for canonical generation based on the Gumbel-Max trick. Experiments on a variety of natural language tasks demonstrate that our sampling algorithm for canonical generation is comparable to standard sampling in terms of performance and runtime, and it solves the problem of tokenization multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Socratic Debates: Examining Persona Effects on Moral Decision and Persuasion Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in morally sensitive domains, it is crucial to understand how persona traits affect their moral reasoning and persuasive behavior. We present the first large-scale study of multi-dimensional persona effects in AI-AI debates over real-world moral dilemmas. Using a 6-dimensional persona space (age, gender, country, class, ideology, and personality), we simulate structured debates between AI agents over 131 relationship-based cases. Our results show that personas affect initial moral stances and debate outcomes, with political ideology and personality traits exerting the strongest influence. Persuasive success varies across traits, with liberal and open personalities reaching higher consensus and win rates. While logit-based confidence grows during debates, emotional and credibility-based appeals diminish, indicating more tempered argumentation over time. These trends mirror findings from psychology and cultural studies, reinforcing the need for persona-aware evaluation frameworks for AI moral reasoning.</description>

      <title>Direct Reasoning Optimization: Constrained RL with Token-Level Dense Reward and Rubric-Gated Constraints for Open-ended Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RL training of LLMs on open-ended tasks is challenging due to the lack of direct verifiability. In this paper, we frame such training as constrained RL that (i) optimizes a token-level dense Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3) aligned with reasoning quality, and (ii) enforces rubric-gating as feasibility constraints at the rollout group level. R3 measures the model's token-level certainty of a reference answer under its CoT reasoning prefix while selectively emphasizing reasoning-reflective tokens to capture how likely the generated reasoning is to yield the desired answer. Rubric-gating complements R3 by operationalizing principled task criteria as hard accept/reject checks on final answers. Empirically, across four datasets, our framework outperforms baselines, achieves faster, more sample-efficient learning, and respects feasibility constraints.</description>

      <title>SAFER: Probing Safety in Reward Models with Sparse Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present Sparse Autoencoder For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/xzy-101/SAFER-code. \textit{This paper discusses topics related to reward model safety and may include discussions or examples that highlight potential risks or unsafe outcomes.}</description>

      <title>PICACO: Pluralistic In-Context Value Alignment of LLMs via Total Correlation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment (ICA). However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs. tradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses, theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise, resulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs, outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance across up to 8 distinct values.</description>

      <title>Debating Truth: Debate-driven Claim Verification with Multiple Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art single-agent claim verification methods struggle with complex claims that require nuanced analysis of multifaceted evidence. Inspired by real-world professional fact-checkers, we propose \textbf{DebateCV}, the first debate-driven claim verification framework powered by multiple LLM agents. In DebateCV, two \textit{Debaters} argue opposing stances to surface subtle errors in single-agent assessments. A decisive \textit{Moderator} is then required to weigh the evidential strength of conflicting arguments to deliver an accurate verdict. Yet, zero-shot Moderators are biased toward neutral judgments, and no datasets exist for training them. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Debate-SFT}, a post-training framework that leverages synthetic data to enhance agents' ability to effectively adjudicate debates for claim verification. Results show that our methods surpass state-of-the-art non-debate approaches in both accuracy (across various evidence conditions) and justification quality.</description>

      <title>ElectriQ: A Benchmark for Assessing the Response Capability of Large Language Models in Power Marketing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As power systems decarbonise and digitalise, high penetrations of distributed energy resources and flexible tariffs make electric power marketing (EPM) a key interface between regulation, system operation and sustainable-energy deployment. Many utilities still rely on human agents and rule- or intent-based chatbots with fragmented knowledge bases that struggle with long, cross-scenario dialogues and fall short of requirements for compliant, verifiable and DR-ready interactions. Meanwhile, frontier large language models (LLMs) show strong conversational ability but are evaluated on generic benchmarks that underweight sector-specific terminology, regulatory reasoning and multi-turn process stability. To address this gap, we present ElectriQ, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework for LLMs in EPM. ElectriQ contains over 550k dialogues across six service domains and 24 sub-scenarios and defines a unified protocol that combines human ratings, automatic metrics and two compliance stress tests-Statutory Citation Correctness and Long-Dialogue Consistency. Building on ElectriQ, we propose SEEK-RAG, a retrieval-augmented method that injects policy and domain knowledge during finetuning and inference. Experiments on 13 LLMs show that domain-aligned 7B models with SEEK-RAG match or surpass much larger models while reducing computational cost, providing an auditable, regulation-aware basis for deploying LLM-based EPM assistants that support demand-side management, renewable integration and resilient grid operation.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Driven Identification and Reconstruction of LLM Weight Homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Matrix-Driven Identification and Reconstruction (MDIR), a SOTA large language model homology method that accurately detects weight correspondences between models and provides rigorous $p$-value estimation of the statistical significance of these correspondences. Our method does not require model inference, and allows the detection of unattributed reuse or replication of model weights even on low-resource devices as it compares only a single pair of matrices at a time. We leverage matrix analysis, polar decomposition, and Large Deviation Theory (LDT) to achieve accurate reconstruction of weight relationships between models. Notably, MDIR is the first method to achieve perfect scores on both Area-Under-Curve (AUC) and accuracy metrics across different source models on LeaFBench.</description>

      <title>BiasGym: Fantastic LLM Biases and How to Find (and Remove) Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. However, biased behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce \texttt{BiasGym}, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable framework for reliably and safely injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual associations of biases within LLMs. \texttt{BiasGym} consists of two components: \texttt{BiasInject}, which safely injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while keeping the model frozen, and \texttt{BiasScope}, which leverages these injected signals to identify and reliably steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and generalizes to biases unseen during fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from Italy being `reckless drivers'), showing its utility for both safety interventions and interpretability research.</description>

      <title>Automatic Reviewers Fail to Detect Faulty Reasoning in Research Papers: A New Counterfactual Evaluation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual dataset and evaluation framework publicly.</description>

      <title>Towards Atoms of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental representational units (FRUs) of large language models (LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce Atom Theory to systematically define, evaluate, and identify such FRUs, which we term atoms. Building on the atomic inner product (AIP), a non-Euclidean metric that captures the underlying geometry of LLM representations, we formally define atoms and propose two key criteria for ideal atoms: faithfulness ($R^2$) and stability ($q^*$). We further prove that atoms are identifiable under threshold-activated sparse autoencoders (TSAEs). Empirically, we uncover a pervasive representation shift in LLMs and demonstrate that the AIP corrects this shift to capture the underlying representational geometry, thereby grounding Atom Theory. We find that two widely used units, neurons and features, fail to qualify as ideal atoms: neurons are faithful ($R^2=1$) but unstable ($q^*=0.5\%$), while features are more stable ($q^*=68.2\%$) but unfaithful ($R^2=48.8\%$). To find atoms of LLMs, leveraging atom identifiability under TSAEs, we show via large-scale experiments that reliable atom identification occurs only when the TSAE capacity matches the data scale. Guided by this insight, we identify FRUs with near-perfect faithfulness ($R^2=99.9\%$) and stability ($q^*=99.8\%$) across layers of Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, satisfying the criteria of ideal atoms statistically. Further analysis confirms that these atoms align with theoretical expectations and exhibit substantially higher monosemanticity. Overall, we propose and validate Atom Theory as a foundation for understanding the internal representations of LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/ChenhuiHu/towards_atoms.</description>

      <title>SimulSense: Sense-Driven Interpreting for Efficient Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.</description>

      <title>ChatInject: Abusing Chat Templates for Prompt Injection in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject, an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates, thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies. Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13% to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2) chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems.</description>

      <title>Dual Mechanisms of Value Expression: Intrinsic vs. Prompted Values in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models can express values in two main ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts. Given their widespread use in value alignment, it is paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on distinct mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream, and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value vectors. We demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common components crucial for inducing value expression, generalizing across languages and reconstructing theoretical inter-value correlations in the model's internal representations. Yet, as these mechanisms also possess unique elements that fulfill distinct roles, they lead to different degrees of response diversity (intrinsic &gt; prompted) and value steerability (prompted &gt; intrinsic). In particular, components unique to the intrinsic mechanism promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas those specific to the prompted mechanism strengthen instruction following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.</description>

      <title>Think Less, Label Better: Multi-Stage Domain-Grounded Synthetic Data Generation for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models in Telecommunications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale, high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However, generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting, where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever, base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Backdoors: An Explainable Defense via Gradient-Attention Anomaly Scoring for Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly when fine-tuned on large, domain-relevant datasets. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed malicious behaviors using trigger patterns in the training data. These triggers remain dormant during normal usage, but, when activated, can cause targeted misclassifications. In this work, we investigate the internal behavior of backdoored pre-trained encoder-based language models, focusing on the consistent shift in attention and gradient attribution when processing poisoned inputs; where the trigger token dominates both attention and gradient signals, overriding the surrounding context. We propose an inference-time defense that constructs anomaly scores by combining token-level attention and gradient information. Extensive experiments on text classification tasks across diverse backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces attack success rates compared to existing baselines. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability-driven analysis of the scoring mechanism, shedding light on trigger localization and the robustness of the proposed defense.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Data Contamination in Psychometric Evaluations of LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies apply psychometric questionnaires to Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess high-level psychological constructs such as values, personality, moral foundations, and dark traits. Although prior work has raised concerns about possible data contamination from psychometric inventories, which may threaten the reliability of such evaluations, there has been no systematic attempt to quantify the extent of this contamination. To address this gap, we propose a framework to systematically measure data contamination in psychometric evaluations of LLMs, evaluating three aspects: (1) item memorization, (2) evaluation memorization, and (3) target score matching. Applying this framework to 21 models from major families and four widely used psychometric inventories, we provide evidence that popular inventories such as the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40) exhibit strong contamination, where models not only memorize items but can also adjust their responses to achieve specific target scores.</description>

      <title>The Unintended Trade-off of AI Alignment:Balancing Hallucination Mitigation and Safety in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.</description>

      <title>Which Heads Matter for Reasoning? RL-Guided KV Cache Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors via extended chain-of-thought generation that are highly fragile to information loss during decoding, creating critical challenges for KV cache compression. Existing token-dropping methods directly disrupt reasoning chains by removing intermediate steps, while head-reallocation methods, designed for retrieval tasks, fail to preserve the heads essential for generative reasoning. However, no existing method can identify which attention heads genuinely maintain reasoning consistency and control generation termination. To address this, we propose RLKV, which uses reinforcement learning as a probe to discover which heads contribute to reasoning quality by directly optimizing their cache usage against actual generation outcomes. This discovery naturally leads to an efficient compression strategy: we allocate full KV cache to reasoning-critical heads while aggressively compressing others. Experiments reveal that a fraction of heads proves essential for reasoning, enabling 20--50% cache reduction with near-lossless performance and up to 1.21x speedup.</description>

      <title>GraphGhost: Tracing Structures Behind Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities on structured tasks, yet the internal mechanisms underlying such behaviors remain poorly understood. Existing interpretation methods mainly focus on token-level attributions, which provide limited insight into multi-step reasoning inside the model. We propose GraphGhost, a graph-based framework that models internal token interactions and neuron activations in LLMs as graphs. By aggregating token dependencies traced across layers, GraphGhost captures global information flow underlying model predictions. We formalize GraphGhost from two complementary perspectives: a sample view, which traces token dependencies for individual predictions, and a dataset view, which aggregates recurring structural patterns learned during training. Through graph analytics and quantitative experiments, we show that graph structural properties are closely associated with influential tokens and neuron nodes, and that perturbations to structurally critical nodes lead to measurable changes in reasoning behavior. These results indicate that the structural patterns captured by GraphGhost reflect meaningful internal organization of LLM reasoning. The codes are available at software part. Artifacts will be made available for research use only.</description>

      <title>GOLD PANNING: Iterative Bayesian Signal Anchoring for Many-Document Needle-in-Haystack Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced position bias in long-context needle-in-haystack problems, systematically prioritizing the location of information over its relevance. While current mitigations rely on white-box access, this is effectively impossible for many state-of-the-art models. We introduce GOLD PANNING, a black-box Bayesian framework that performs inference-time active search over long contexts by (i) reordering documents to concentrate high-belief items in highly diagnostic positions (signal anchoring) and (ii) updating beliefs over document relevance from model outputs. Unlike conventional active learning, which prioritizes uncertainty reduction, GOLD PANNING leverages anchoring -- once flagged, keep it in sight -- to preserve weak cues. We implement this using iterative assignment derived from the model's diagnosticity profile, which provably identifies a target among $N$ documents in $O(\log N)$ rounds, ensuring scalability to many-document settings.On needle-in-a-haystack retrieval and long-context QA, GOLD PANNING matches Permutation Self-Consistency's target identification with $30--65%$ fewer queries and remains effective under calibration mismatch, suggesting coarse positional ordering drives performance gains. These results demonstrate that inherent model biases need not be failures, but can be used as tools for control.</description>

Abstract: As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance between safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms, while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18 VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.</description>

      <title>DialectGen: Benchmarking and Improving Dialect Robustness in Multimodal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200 unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance by small margins (&lt; 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.</description>

      <title>LLM Latent Reasoning as Chain of Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent reasoning offers a computation-efficient alternative to Chain-of-Thought but often suffers from performance degradation due to distributional misalignment and ambiguous chain definitions. Ideally, latent reasoning should function as a superposition of multiple reasoning paths. To realize this, we introduce Latent-SFT, a unified framework addressing challenges at three levels: token, chain, and learning. First, we define the Latent-Vocab to constrain hidden states within the pre-trained vocab-space. Second, we construct the Latent-Chain via Induction-Supervision Masking to ensure semantic compactness and sufficiency. Third, we employ Latent-Optim with stochastic Gumbel-Softmax to guide the model toward generalizable solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that Latent-SFT consistently outperforms explicit SFT across six mathematical benchmarks (e.g., GSM8k, AIME24) while achieving a 2.7x to 5.5x reduction in reasoning length. Analysis confirms that our method effectively captures a superposition of diverse reasoning trajectories rather than merely compressing a single path.</description>

      <title>Context-aware Fairness Evaluation and Mitigation in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift, amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors. However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues, enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.</description>

      <title>Emotions Where Art Thou: Understanding and Characterizing the Emotional Latent Space of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages. Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance, indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process emotion.</description>

      <title>Batch Speculative Decoding Done Right</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative decoding must produce outputs distribution identical to standard autoregressive generation-this output equivalence is not an optimization target but the defining criterion of valid speculative decoding. We demonstrate that all existing batch speculative decoding implementations violate this fundamental requirement, producing corrupted outputs ranging from repetitive tokens to gibberish. These failures stem from the ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of draft tokens, desynchronizing position IDs, attention masks, and KV-cache state. We present the first authentic batch speculative decoding framework. We (1) formalize the synchronization invariants that valid batch speculative decoding must satisfy, (2) present EQSPEC, the first algorithm that guarantees output equivalence, and analyze its cost structure to show that alignment overhead grows superlinearly and consumes up to 40\% of computation, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which reduces this overhead through cross-batch scheduling that dynamically groups same-length sequences. On SpecBench across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B pairs, our methods achieve up to 3x throughput improvement at batch size 8 while maintaining algorithmic correctness. Our methods achieve 95\% decoding-equivalence, with residual divergence attributable to floating-point non-determinism in GPU inference, not the synchronization failures that cause near-zero equivalence of prior methods.

      <title>Multi-Step Knowledge Interaction Analysis via Rank-2 Subspace Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) describe how Large Language Models (LLMs) make decisions by drawing on external Context Knowledge (CK) and Parametric Knowledge (PK). Understanding the interaction between these sources is key to assessing NLE grounding, yet these dynamics remain underexplored. Prior work has largely focused on (1) single-step generation and (2) modelled PK-CK interaction as a binary choice within a rank-1 subspace. This approach overlooks richer interactions and how they unfold over longer generations, such as complementary or supportive knowledge. We propose a novel rank-2 projection subspace that disentangles PK and CK contributions more accurately and use it for the first multi-step analysis of knowledge interactions across longer NLE sequences. Experiments across four QA datasets and three open-weight LLMs demonstrate that while rank-1 subspaces struggle to represent diverse interactions, our rank-2 formulation captures them effectively, highlighting PK alignment for supportive interactions and CK alignment for conflicting ones. Our multi-step analysis reveals, among others, that hallucinated generations exhibit strong alignment with the PK direction, whereas context-faithful generations maintain a more balanced alignment between PK and CK.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Adversarial Robustness-Performance Trade-off in Text Classification via Manifold Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A persistent challenge in text classification (TC) is that enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks typically degrades performance on clean data. We argue that this challenge can be resolved by modeling the distribution of clean samples in the encoder embedding manifold. To this end, we propose the Manifold-Correcting Causal Flow (MC^2F), a two-module system that operates directly on sentence embeddings. A Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) learns the density of the clean data manifold. It identifies out-of-distribution embeddings, which are then corrected by a Geodesic Purification Solver. This solver projects adversarial points back onto the learned manifold via the shortest path, restoring a clean, semantically coherent representation. We conducted extensive evaluations on text classification (TC) across three datasets and multiple adversarial attacks. The results demonstrate that our method, MC^2F, not only establishes a new state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness but also fully preserves performance on clean data, even yielding modest gains in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Evaluating from Benign to Dynamic Adversarial: A Squid Game for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential data contamination issue in contemporary large language models (LLMs) benchmarks presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, they predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Squid Game}, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, including instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition in performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. We also compare prominent LLM benchmarks and \textsc{Squid Game}, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations.

      <title>Tracing Multilingual Representations in LLMs with Cross-Layer Transcoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train models on different multilingual mixtures and analyze their internal mechanisms using Cross-Layer Transcoders (CLTs) and Attribution Graphs. Our results reveal multilingual shared representations: the model employs highly similar features across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers.
  Training models without English shows identical multilingual shared space structures. Decoding relies partly on a small set of high-frequency features in the final layers, which linearly encode language identity from early layers. Intervening on these features allows one language to be suppressed and another substituted. Finally, to explain non-English failures, we perform a Model-Diffing experiment: underperformance arises from dim late-layer features, weak middle-layer clusters, and tokenizer bias toward English that forces early layers to specialize in word reassembly. Finetuning strengthens these features and their links, improving token assembly and language-specific decoding, providing a mechanistic explanation for multilingual gaps. Our models and CLTs are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/CausalNLP/multilingual-clts and https://huggingface.co/collections/CausalNLP/multilingual-gpt2-models.

      <title>What Helps Language Models Predict Human Beliefs: Demographics or Prior Stances?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beliefs shape how people reason, communicate, and behave. Rather than existing in isolation, they exhibit a rich correlational structure--some connected through logical dependencies, others through indirect associations or social processes. As usage of large language models (LLMs) becomes more ubiquitous in our society, LLMs' ability to understand and reason through human beliefs has many implications from privacy issues to personalized persuasion and the potential for stereotyping. Yet how LLMs capture this interrelated landscape of beliefs remains unclear. For instance, when predicting someone's beliefs, what information affects the prediction most--who they are (demographics), what else they believe (prior stances), or a combination of both? We address these questions using data from an online debate platform, evaluating the ability of off-the-shelf open-weight LLMs to predict individuals' stance under four conditions: no context, demographics only, prior beliefs only, and both combined. We find that both types of information improve predictions over a blind baseline, with their combination yielding the best performance in most cases. However, the relative value of each varies substantially across belief domains. These findings reveal how current LLMs leverage different types of social information when reasoning about human beliefs, highlighting both their capabilities and limitations.</description>

      <title>SSA: Sparse Sparse Attention by Aligning Full and Sparse Attention Outputs in Feature Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse attention reduces the quadratic complexity of full self-attention but faces two challenges: (1) an attention gap, where applying sparse attention to full-attention-trained models causes performance degradation due to train-inference distribution mismatch, and (2) a capability gap, where models trained purely with sparse attention lack complete gradient flow, preventing them from matching full-attention performance. We propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a training framework that integrates both sparse and full attention with bidirectional attention-output alignment. We prove that the approximation error scales linearly with the attention mass dropped under sparse attention, and show that SSA's alignment objective substantially reduces this quantity compared to baselines. Experiments demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both inference modes, adapts smoothly to varying sparsity budgets, and demonstrates superior long-context capabilities.

      <title>Beyond Retrieval: A Modular Benchmark for Academic Deep Research Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A surge in academic publications calls for automated deep research (DR) systems, but accurately evaluating them is still an open problem. First, existing benchmarks often focus narrowly on retrieval while neglecting high-level planning and reasoning. Second, existing benchmarks favor general domains over the academic domains that are the core application for DR agents. To address these gaps, we introduce ADRA-Bank, a modular benchmark for Academic DR Agents. Grounded in academic literature, our benchmark is a human-annotated dataset of 200 instances across 10 academic domains, including both research and review papers. Furthermore, we propose a modular Evaluation Paradigm for Academic DR Agents (ADRA-Eval), which leverages the rich structure of academic papers to assess the core capabilities of planning, retrieval, and reasoning. It employs two complementary modes: an end-to-end evaluation for \task agents and an isolated evaluation for foundational LLMs as potential backbones. Results reveal uneven capabilities: while agents show specialized strengths, they struggle with multi-source retrieval and cross-field consistency. Moreover, improving high-level planning capability is the crucial factor for unlocking the reasoning potential of foundational LLMs as backbones. By exposing these actionable failure modes, ADRA-Bank provides a diagnostic tool to guide the development of more reliable automatic academic research assistants.</description>

      <title>EtCon: Edit-then-Consolidate for Reliable Knowledge Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to update specific facts in large language models (LLMs) without full retraining. Prior efforts sought to tune the knowledge layers of LLMs, achieving improved performance in controlled, teacher-forced evaluations. However, they still encounter challenges in real-world autoregressive generation scenarios, which greatly limit their practical applicability. Our empirical analysis reveals two issues: (1) Most methods degrade pre-trained capabilities after injecting new knowledge; (2) They may exhibit a discrepancy between stored parametric knowledge and inference-time autoregressive generation behavior. To this end, we propose EtCon, an edit-then-consolidate paradigm that couples targeted edits with post-edit consolidation. Specifically, our framework comprises two stages: (1) Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT) performs a constrained targeted edit to update parametric knowledge while controlling policy drift. (2) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) consolidates the edit by aligning autoregressive trajectories with the intended fact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EtCon improves editing reliability and real-world generalization, while better preserving pre-trained capabilities.</description>

      <title>Knowing What's Missing: Assessing Information Sufficiency in Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining whether a provided context contains sufficient information to answer a question is a critical challenge for building reliable question-answering systems. While simple prompting strategies have shown success on factual questions, they frequently fail on inferential ones that require reasoning beyond direct text extraction. We hypothesize that asking a model to first reason about what specific information is missing provides a more reliable, implicit signal for assessing overall sufficiency. To this end, we propose a structured Identify-then-Verify framework for robust sufficiency modeling. Our method first generates multiple hypotheses about missing information and establishes a semantic consensus. It then performs a critical verification step, forcing the model to re-examine the source text to confirm whether this information is truly absent. We evaluate our method against established baselines across diverse multi-hop and factual QA datasets. The results demonstrate that by guiding the model to justify its claims about missing information, our framework produces more accurate sufficiency judgments while clearly articulating any information gaps.</description>

      <title>From Next-Token to Next-Block: A Principled Adaptation Path for Diffusion LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) enable fast generation, yet training large DLMs from scratch is costly. As a practical shortcut, adapting off-the-shelf Auto-Regressive (AR) model weights into a DLM could quickly equip the DLM with strong long-context generation capabilies. Prior "adaptation" attempts either modify logits or randomly grow attention masks to Full-Sequence diffusion, or simply transplant AR weights into a Block-Diffusion recipe, leaving two key questions unaddressed: where is the final destination of adaptation, and how to adapt better? For manifold benefits, we reframe the whole AR-to-DLM adaptation under the Block-Diffusion paradigm, transitioning from block size 1 to the final Block-Diffusion state. Concretely, the principled pathway of adaptation is designed as follows: we keep a context-causal path where causal attention is kept in the prefix, an efficient parallel adaptation procedure where an AR guidance is maintained, and gradual increment of the generation block size for a smoother transition. Built on these components, the adaptation is proved competitive on various models at different scales. With better adaptation, we propose NBDiff-7B that could inherit the long-context modeling and reasoning capabilities, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among the 7B-class DLMs. Codes: https://github.com/YuchuanTian/NBDiff.</description>

      <title>Bounding Hallucinations: Information-Theoretic Guarantees for RAG Systems via Merlin-Arthur Protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) relies on retrieved context to guide large language models (LLM), yet treats retrieval as a weak heuristic rather than verifiable evidence -- leading to unsupported answers, hallucinations, and reliance on spurious context. We introduce a novel training framework that treats the RAG pipeline as an interactive proof system by adapting the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol: Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions with unknown context provenance and Merlin gives helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use an XAI method to identify and modify evidence most influential to Arthur. This trains Arthur to (1) answer when evidence supports the answer, (2) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (3) rely on the context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a verification framework that disentangles explanation fidelity from model predictive errors, and introduce the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A mutual-information guarantees. Across three RAG datasets and multiple LLM families and sizes, M/A training makes LLMs more grounded in evidence, increases information theoretic measures (soundness, completeness) and reject behavior with less hallucinations, without manually annotated unanswerable samples. Finally, the retriever also improves recall and MRR via automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. While high accuracy does not guarantee entropy flow from context to answer, our EIF results show that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision enables RAG systems that treat retrieved documents as verifiable evidence. % rather than suggestions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most modern computational approaches to lexical semantic change detection (LSC) rely on embedding-based distributional word representations with neural networks. Despite the strong performance on LSC benchmarks, they are often opaque. We investigate an alternative method which relies purely on dependency co-occurrence patterns of words. We demonstrate that it is effective for semantic change detection and even outperforms a number of distributional semantic models. We provide an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the predictions, showing that they are plausible and interpretable.</description>

      <title>DeepResearch Bench II: Diagnosing Deep Research Agents via Rubrics from Expert Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Research Systems (DRS) aim to help users search the web, synthesize information, and deliver comprehensive investigative reports. However, how to rigorously evaluate these systems remains under-explored. Existing deep-research benchmarks often fall into two failure modes. Some do not adequately test a system's ability to analyze evidence and write coherent reports. Others rely on evaluation criteria that are either overly coarse or directly defined by LLMs (or both), leading to scores that can be biased relative to human experts and are hard to verify or interpret. To address these issues, we introduce Deep Research Bench II, a new benchmark for evaluating DRS-generated reports. It contains 132 grounded research tasks across 22 domains; for each task, a system must produce a long-form research report that is evaluated by a set of 9430 fine-grained binary rubrics in total, covering three dimensions: information recall, analysis, and presentation. All rubrics are derived from carefully selected expert-written investigative articles and are constructed through a four-stage LLM+human pipeline that combines automatic extraction with over 400 human-hours of expert review, ensuring that the criteria are atomic, verifiable, and aligned with human expert judgment. We evaluate several state-of-the-art deep-research systems on Deep Research Bench II and find that even the strongest models satisfy fewer than 50% of the rubrics, revealing a substantial gap between current DRSs and human experts.</description>

      <title>HumanLLM: Benchmarking and Improving LLM Anthropomorphism via Human Cognitive Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and generation, serving as the foundation for advanced persona simulation and Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs). However, achieving authentic alignment with human cognitive and behavioral patterns remains a critical challenge for these agents. We present HumanLLM, a framework treating psychological patterns as interacting causal forces. We construct 244 patterns from ~12,000 academic papers and synthesize 11,359 scenarios where 2-5 patterns reinforce, conflict, or modulate each other, with multi-turn conversations expressing inner thoughts, actions, and dialogue. Our dual-level checklists evaluate both individual pattern fidelity and emergent multi-pattern dynamics, achieving strong human alignment (r=0.91) while revealing that holistic metrics conflate simulation accuracy with social desirability. HumanLLM-8B outperforms Qwen3-32B on multi-pattern dynamics despite 4x fewer parameters, demonstrating that authentic anthropomorphism requires cognitive modeling--simulating not just what humans do, but the psychological processes generating those behaviors.</description>

      <title>ATOD: An Evaluation Framework and Benchmark for Agentic Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, driven by large language models (LLMs) with extensive API and tool integration, have enabled conversational agents to coordinate interleaved goals, maintain long-horizon context, and act proactively through asynchronous execution. These capabilities extend beyond traditional TOD systems, yet existing benchmarks lack systematic support for evaluating such agentic behaviors. To address this gap, we introduce ATOD, a benchmark and synthetic dialogue generation pipeline that produces richly annotated conversations requiring long-term reasoning. ATOD captures key characteristics of advanced TOD, including multi-goal coordination, dependency management, memory, adaptability, and proactivity. Building on ATOD, we propose ATOD-Eval, a holistic evaluation framework that translates these dimensions into fine-grained metrics and supports reproducible offline and online evaluation. We further present a strong agentic memory-based evaluator for benchmarking on ATOD. Experiments show that ATOD-Eval enables comprehensive assessment across task completion, agentic capability, and response quality, and that the proposed evaluator offers a better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to existing memory- and LLM-based approaches under this evaluation setting.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability of LLMs' Belief Systems? LLMs Belief Resistance Check Through Strategic Persuasive Conversation Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in various question-answering tasks. However, recent studies showcase that LLMs are susceptible to persuasion and could adopt counterfactual beliefs. We present a systematic evaluation of LLM susceptibility to persuasion under the Source--Message--Channel--Receiver (SMCR) communication framework. Across five mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) and three domains (factual knowledge, medical QA, and social bias), we analyze how different persuasive strategies influence belief stability over multiple interaction turns. We further examine whether meta-cognition prompting (i.e., eliciting self-reported confidence) affects resistance to persuasion. Results show that the smallest model (Llama 3.2-3B) exhibits extreme compliance, with 82.5% of belief changes occurring at the first persuasive turn (average end turn of 1.1--1.4). Contrary to expectations, meta-cognition prompting increases vulnerability by accelerating belief erosion rather than enhancing robustness. Finally, we evaluate adversarial fine-tuning as a defense. While GPT-4o-mini achieves near-complete robustness (98.6%) and Mistral~7B improves substantially (35.7% $\rightarrow$ 79.3%), Llama models remain highly susceptible (&lt;14%) even when fine-tuned on their own failure cases. Together, these findings highlight substantial model-dependent limits of current robustness interventions and offer guidance for developing more trustworthy LLMs.</description>

      <title>LogicScore: Fine-grained Logic Evaluation of Conciseness, Completeness, and Determinateness in Attributed Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current evaluation methods for Attributed Question Answering (AQA) suffer from \textit{attribution myopia}: they emphasize verification of isolated statements and their attributions but overlook the global logical integrity of long-form answers. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce factually grounded yet logically incoherent responses with elusive deductive gaps. To mitigate this limitation, we present \textsc{LogicScore}, a unified evaluation framework that shifts the paradigm from local assessment to global reasoning scrutiny. Grounded in Horn Rules, our approach integrates a backward verification mechanism to systematically evaluate three key reasoning dimensions: \textit{Completeness} (logically sound deduction), \textit{Conciseness} (non-redundancy), and \textit{Determinateness} (consistent answer entailment). Extensive experiments across three multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, MusiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) and over 20 LLMs (including GPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, LLaMA3, and task-specific tuned models) reveal a critical capability gap: leading models often achieve high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85\% precision for Gemini-3 Pro) but struggle with global reasoning quality (e.g., 35.11\% Conciseness for Gemini-3 Pro). Our work establishes a robust standard for logical evaluation, highlighting the need to prioritize reasoning coherence alongside factual grounding in LLM development.

      <title>Trajectory2Task: Training Robust Tool-Calling Agents with Synthesized Yet Verifiable Data for Complex User Intents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tool-calling agents are increasingly deployed in real-world customer-facing workflows. Yet most studies on tool-calling agents focus on idealized settings with general, fixed, and well-specified tasks. In real-world applications, user requests are often (1) ambiguous, (2) changing over time, or (3) infeasible due to policy constraints, and training and evaluation data that cover these diverse, complex interaction patterns remain under-represented. To bridge the gap, we present Trajectory2Task, a verifiable data generation pipeline for studying tool use at scale under three realistic user scenarios: ambiguous intent, changing intent, and infeasible intents. The pipeline first conducts multi-turn exploration to produce valid tool-call trajectories. It then converts these trajectories into user-facing tasks with controlled intent adaptations. This process yields verifiable task that support closed-loop evaluation and training. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art LLMs on the generated complex user scenario tasks and observe frequent failures. Finally, using successful trajectories obtained from task rollouts, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs and find consistent improvements across all three conditions, along with better generalization to unseen tool-use domains, indicating stronger general tool-calling ability.</description>

      <title>AgentIF-OneDay: A Task-level Instruction-Following Benchmark for General AI Agents in Daily Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capacity of AI agents to effectively handle tasks of increasing duration and complexity continues to grow, demonstrating exceptional performance in coding, deep research, and complex problem-solving evaluations. However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this report, we introduce Qwen3-ASR family, which includes two powerful all-in-one speech recognition models and a novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.</description>

      <title>ASTRA: Automated Synthesis of agentic Trajectories and Reinforcement Arenas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as tool-augmented agents for multi-step decision making, yet training robust tool-using agents remains challenging. Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability.

      <title>Toward Culturally Aligned LLMs through Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.</description>

      <title>CoFrGeNet: Continued Fraction Architectures for Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers are arguably the preferred architecture for language generation. In this paper, inspired by continued fractions, we introduce a new function class for generative modeling. The architecture family implementing this function class is named CoFrGeNets - Continued Fraction Generative Networks. We design novel architectural components based on this function class that can replace Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer blocks while requiring much fewer parameters. We derive custom gradient formulations to optimize the proposed components more accurately and efficiently than using standard PyTorch-based gradients. Our components are a plug-in replacement requiring little change in training or inference procedures that have already been put in place for Transformer-based models thus making our approach easy to incorporate in large industrial workflows. We experiment on two very different transformer architectures GPT2-xl (1.5B) and Llama3 (3.2B), where the former we pre-train on OpenWebText and GneissWeb, while the latter we pre-train on the docling data mix which consists of nine different datasets. Results show that the performance on downstream classification, Q\&amp; A, reasoning and text understanding tasks of our models is competitive and sometimes even superior to the original models with $\frac{2}{3}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ the parameters and shorter pre-training time. We believe that future implementations customized to hardware will further bring out the true potential of our architectures.</description>

      <title>Token-Guard: Towards Token-Level Hallucination Control via Self-Checking Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating content inconsistent with the input. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can mitigate hallucinations but require resource-intensive retrieval or large-scale fine-tuning. Decoding-based methods are lighter yet lack explicit hallucination control. To address this, we present Token-Guard, a token-level hallucination control method based on self-checking decoding. Token-Guard performs internal verification at each reasoning step to detect hallucinated tokens before they propagate. Candidate fragments are further evaluated in a latent space with explicit hallucination risk scoring, while iterative pruning and regeneration dynamically correct detected errors. Experiments on HALU datasets show Token-Guard substantially reduces hallucinations and improves generation accuracy, offering a scalable, modular solution for reliable LLM outputs. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>FC-KAN: Function Combinations in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce FC-KAN, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that leverages combinations of popular mathematical functions such as B-splines, wavelets, and radial basis functions on low-dimensional data through element-wise operations. We explore several methods for combining the outputs of these functions, including sum, element-wise product, the addition of sum and element-wise product, representations of quadratic and cubic functions, concatenation, linear transformation of the concatenated output, and others. In our experiments, we compare FC-KAN with a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and other existing KANs, such as BSRBF-KAN, EfficientKAN, FastKAN, and FasterKAN, on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Two variants of FC-KAN, which use a combination of outputs from B-splines and Difference of Gaussians (DoG) and from B-splines and linear transformations in the form of a quadratic function, outperformed overall other models on the average of 5 independent training runs. We expect that FC-KAN can leverage function combinations to design future KANs. Our repository is publicly available at: https://github.com/hoangthangta/FC_KAN.</description>

      <title>ARB-LLM: Alternating Refined Binarizations for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly pushed forward advancements in natural language processing, yet their high memory and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Binarization, as an effective compression technique, can shrink model weights to just 1 bit, significantly reducing the high demands on computation and memory. However, current binarization methods struggle to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, while also overlooking the column deviation in LLM weight distribution. To tackle these issues, we propose ARB-LLM, a novel 1-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) technique tailored for LLMs. To narrow the distribution shift between binarized and full-precision weights, we first design an alternating refined binarization (ARB) algorithm to progressively update the binarization parameters, which significantly reduces the quantization error. Moreover, considering the pivot role of calibration data and the column deviation in LLM weights, we further extend ARB to ARB-X and ARB-RC. In addition, we refine the weight partition strategy with column-group bitmap (CGB), which further enhance performance. Equipping ARB-X and ARB-RC with CGB, we obtain ARB-LLM$_\text{X}$ and ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ respectively, which significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) binarization methods for LLMs. As a binary PTQ method, our ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ is the first to surpass FP16 models of the same size. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/ZHITENGLI/ARB-LLM.</description>

      <title>FactSelfCheck: Fact-Level Black-Box Hallucination Detection for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content, posing significant challenges for applications where factuality is crucial. While existing hallucination detection methods typically operate at the sentence level or passage level, we propose FactSelfCheck, a novel zero-resource black-box sampling-based method that enables fine-grained fact-level detection. Our approach represents text as interpretable knowledge graphs consisting of facts in the form of triples, providing clearer insights into content factuality than traditional approaches. Through analyzing factual consistency across multiple LLM responses, we compute fine-grained hallucination scores without requiring external resources or training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that FactSelfCheck performs competitively with leading sentence-level sampling-based methods while providing more detailed and interpretable insights. Most notably, our fact-level approach significantly improves hallucination correction, achieving a 35.5% increase in factual content compared to the baseline, while sentence-level SelfCheckGPT yields only a 10.6% improvement. The granular nature of our detection enables more precise identification and correction of hallucinated content. Additionally, we contribute FavaMultiSamples, a novel dataset that addresses a gap in the field by providing the research community with a second dataset for evaluating sampling-based methods.</description>

      <title>LightRetriever: A LLM-based Text Retrieval Architecture with Extremely Faster Query Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12260v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text retrieval retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full LLM on an A800 GPU, our method achieves over 1000x speedup in query encoding and over 10x increase in end-to-end retrieval throughput. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks show that LightRetriever generalizes well across diverse tasks, maintaining an average of 95% retrieval performance.</description>

      <title>Warm Up Before You Train: Unlocking General Reasoning in Resource-Constrained Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing effective reasoning-capable LLMs typically requires training using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) or distillation with carefully curated Long Chain of Thoughts (CoT), both of which depend heavily on extensive training data. This creates a major challenge when the amount of quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the first stage, we "warm up" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain, namely, Knights \&amp; Knaves (K\&amp;K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this two-phase approach offers several benefits: $(i)$ the warmup phase alone facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval$^{+}$, and MMLU-Pro; $(ii)$ When both the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small dataset ($\leq100$ examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the base model; $(iii)$ Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; $(iv)$ Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall sample efficiency during RLVR training. The results in this paper highlight the promise of warmup for building robust reasoning LLMs in data-scarce environments.</description>

      <title>NeUQI: Near-Optimal Uniform Quantization Parameter Initialization for Low-Bit LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across domains but face significant challenges when deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or personal devices such as laptops, due to high memory consumption and inference costs. Post-training quantization (PTQ) of LLMs offers a promising solution that reduces their memory footprint and decoding latency. In practice, PTQ with uniform quantization representation is favored due to its efficiency and ease of deployment, as uniform quantization is widely supported by mainstream hardware and software libraries. Recent studies on low-bit uniform quantization have led to noticeable improvements in post-quantization model performance; however, they mainly focus on quantization methodologies, while the initialization of quantization parameters remains underexplored and still relies on the conventional Min-Max formula. In this work, we identify the limitations of the Min-Max formula, move beyond its constraints, and propose NeUQI, a method that efficiently determines near-optimal initialization for uniform quantization. Our NeUQI simplifies the joint optimization of the scale and zero-point by deriving the zero-point for a given scale, thereby reducing the problem to a scale-only optimization. Benefiting from the improved quantization parameters, our NeUQI consistently outperforms existing methods in the experiments with the LLaMA and Qwen families on various settings and tasks. Furthermore, when combined with a lightweight distillation strategy, NeUQI even achieves superior performance to PV-tuning, a considerably more resource-intensive method.</description>

      <title>VScan: Rethinking Visual Token Reduction for Efficient Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding. However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2) introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a 10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4\% of the original performance.

      <title>MetaLint: Generalizable Idiomatic Code Quality Analysis through Instruction-Following and Easy-to-Hard Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models excel at code generation but struggle with code quality analysis, where best practices evolve and cannot be fully captured by static training data. We introduce MetaLint, a training framework that treats code quality analysis as detecting best practice violations from high-level specifications over semantic code fragments (code idioms). Instead of training on a fixed set of rules, MetaLint reorganizes supervision around dynamically specified best practices using synthetic linter-derived labels, integrated with instruction-following and preference optimization. This encourages extrapolation to more complex, unseen best practices at test time, consistent with easy-to-hard generalization without retraining. To evaluate MetaLint, we create a new benchmark of hard-to-detect best practices inspired by Python Enhancement Proposals. Across this benchmark, MetaLint improves generalization to unseen best practices. Qwen3-4B achieves a 2.7x detection F-score gain (25.9% -&gt; 70.4%), the highest recall, and a 26.7% localization F-score, matching larger models such as o3-mini. These gains generalize across programming languages, model families, scales, reasoning settings, and linter sources.</description>

      <title>FLM-Audio: Natural Monologues Improves Native Full-Duplex Chatbots via Dual Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models aim to listen and speak simultaneously, delivering rapid responses to dynamic user input. Among different solutions to full-duplexity, a native solution merges multiple channels in each time step, achieving the lowest latency. However, prevailing designs break down the textual monologue sentences for word-level alignment with audio streams, which degrades language modeling abilities. To help address this issue, we introduce "contiguous monologues", which are composed by continuous sentences and "waiting" intervals, mimicking human-like cognitive behavior in dialogs. We find a proper training paradigm to be critical for semantically aligning contiguous monologues with audio. To this end, we develop a "dual" training paradigm that alternates the position of the monologues, either leading or trailing the audio, across different training stages. A combination of our contiguous monologue and dual training strategy is applied in developing FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog chatbot with native full-duplexity. As confirmed by experimental results, FLM-Audio achieves superior response qualities and chatting experiences while requiring significantly less training data.</description>

      <title>RAFFLES: Reasoning-based Attribution of Faults for LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of complex, interconnected long-horizon LLM systems has made it incredibly tricky to identify where and when these systems break down. Evaluation capabilities that currently exist today are limited in that they often focus on simple metrics, end-to-end outcomes, and are dependent on the perspectives of humans. In order to match the increasing complexity of these many component systems, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason, probe, iterate, and understand the nuanced logic passing through these systems. In this paper, we present RAFFLES, an offline evaluation architecture that incorporates iterative reasoning. Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using a central Judge to systematically identify faults and a set of specialized Evaluators to assess the quality of the candidate faults as well as rationales of the Judge. We evaluated RAFFLES with several benchmarks - the Who&amp;When dataset to identify step-level faults in multi-agent systems and the ReasonEval datasets to diagnose step-level mathematical reasoning errors. RAFFLES outperforms strong baselines, achieving an accuracy of over 20% and 50% on the Who&amp;When Hand-Crafted and Algorithmically-Generated datasets, and over 80% on the ReasonEval datasets. These results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual review.</description>

      <title>FESTA: Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment of Multimodal LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16648v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate trust assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generated predictions, which can enable selective prediction and improve user confidence, is challenging due to the diverse multi-modal input paradigms. We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.</description>

      <title>IRIS: Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary to recent findings in math and code reasoning, we show that minimizing self-certainty, rather than maximizing it, improves image generation. We observe that autoregressive T2I models with higher certainty are likely to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human preferences, and models with lower certainty are likely to generate vivid images rich in detail. Based on this observation, we propose IRIS(Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves performance superior to those trained by individual external rewards, and matching those trained by ensemble external rewards. IRIS also incentivizes the emergence of nuanced CoT reasoning for high-quality image generation.</description>

      <title>Thoughtbubbles: an Unsupervised Method for Parallel Thinking in Latent Space</title>

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers train them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot be applied during pretraining and rely solely on serially-generated, natural-language verbalization. In this work, we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete residual streams. Thus, tokens requiring more computation can form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only language modeling loss. Using half of the training budget, Thoughtbubbles outperforms the perplexity and zero-shot evals of both standard decoder LMs and those using non-adaptive parallel computation approaches. These results hold across model sizes from 150M to 1.9B. Thoughtbubbles achieves competitive GSM8K results using half of the baseline's token budget. The implicit nature of our method enables models to begin learning adaptive computation at pretraining time, paving the way to unified train-time and test-time scaling behaviors.</description>

      <title>It Takes Two: Your GRPO Is Secretly DPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a prominent reinforcement learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models. Different from critic-based methods such as PPO, GRPO estimates the advantage function using group-level statistics to reduce the variance of policy gradient estimators. While the prevailing view attributes GRPO's effectiveness to large group sizes for accurate advantage estimation, we propose a different perspective. We demonstrate that the efficacy of GRPO stems from its implicit contrastive objective in the optimization, which helps reduce variance via the control variate method. This perspective establishes a fundamental connection between GRPO and DPO, wherein group size influences only the Monte Carlo estimators of the contrastive objective. To validate this, we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration permissible under the contrastive framework but typically considered insufficient for reward normalization. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of 2-GRPO and empirically validate its effectiveness: 2-GRPO retains 98.1% of the performance of 16-GRPO, while requiring only 12.5% of the rollouts and 21% of the training time. This study offers a new perspective for future algorithm design in LLM post-training.</description>

      <title>InvThink: Towards AI Safety via Inverse Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives language models the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1) enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our paper reveals three key findings: (i) InvThink demonstrates significantly improved safety reasoning as model size scales, compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing applications (medicine, finance, law) and agentic risk scenarios (blackmail, murder), achieving up to 17.8% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt. We further equip InvThink with supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These results suggest that InvThink provides a scalable and generalizable path toward safer, more capable language models.</description>

      <title>Agentic Context Engineering: Evolving Contexts for Self-Improving Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptation -- modifying inputs with instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured, incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory), consistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost. Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model. These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable, efficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.</description>

      <title>Metis-SPECS: Decoupling Multimodal Learning via Self-distilled Preference-based Cold Start</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%. Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and raising the performance ceiling.

      <title>CATArena: Evaluating Evolutionary Capabilities of Code Agents via Iterative Tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current evaluation for Large Language Model (LLM) code agents predominantly focus on generating functional code in single-turn scenarios, which fails to evaluate the agent's capability for continuous code optimization and multi-turn iterative development. To bridge this gap, we introduce CATArena, a framework designed to evaluate the evolutionary capabilities of code agents via iterative tournaments. Agents engage in multi-turn tournaments and continuously refine their code through self-reflection and peer-learning based on comprehensive execution feedback. For evaluation, we propose a dual-metric system to decouple static generation proficiency from evolutionary potential. Extensive experiments reveal that an agent's evolutionary potential is not strictly correlated with its initial proficiency. Our analysis further reveals that current agents struggle to concurrently leverage both peer-learning and self-reflection for effective performance gains. Furthermore, the results validate CATArena's high extensibility and resistance to variance tasks, establishing it as a continuous and reliable standard for assessing the evolutionary capability of LLM code agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can internalize private or harmful content, motivating unlearning that removes a forget set while preserving retaining knowledge. However, forgetting updates often cause collateral degradation on retaining knowledge, creating a persistent trade-off. Existing LLM unlearning methods are often heuristic, and other theoretical approaches rely on offline feature constructions that do not capture update-time forget-retain interaction in LLMs. To address this limitation, we aim to develop an LLM unlearning method that reduces the forget-retain trade-off with theoretical guarantees. We take a first-principles view by formalizing "no side effects" as local retain invariance under small parameter updates, and prove an equivalence under optimizer-induced geometry: the retain loss is locally invariant if and only if the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients. Based on the insight, we propose Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU), a lightweight and theoretically grounded projection that can be plug-and-play to existing gradient-based unlearning methods to mitigate forget-retain side effects. Experiments on TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP-cyber show that GU strengthens forgetting while reducing retain drift. When added to SimNPO, it achieves up to 62\% improved forgetting Extraction Strength (ES) and 31\% higher retain ES. We open-sourced our code in https://github.com/Lemutisme/Geometric-Unlearning.</description>

      <title>TALES: A Taxonomy and Analysis of Cultural Representations in LLM-generated Stories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how they represent diverse cultures. However, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived experience and native language proficiency from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88% of the generated stories contain misrepresentations, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. We also transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of deep residual networks hinges on the identity shortcut connection. While this mechanism alleviates the vanishing-gradient problem, it also has a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, limiting the network's ability to model complex hidden state transitions. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Deep Delta Learning (DDL)}, which generalizes the shortcut from a fixed identity map to a learnable, state-dependent linear operator. The resulting Delta Operator is a rank-1 perturbation of the identity, $\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{X}) = \mathbf{I}- \beta(\mathbf{X})\mathbf{k} (\mathbf{X}) \mathbf{k} (\mathbf{X})^\top$, parameterized by a unit direction $\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{X})$ and a scalar gate $\beta(\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis showing that $\beta(\mathbf{X})$ continuously interpolates the shortcut between identity ($\beta=0$), orthogonal projection ($\beta=1$), and Householder reflection ($\beta=2$). Furthermore, we rewrite the residual update as a synchronized rank-1 delta write: $\beta$ scales both the removal of the current $\mathbf{k}$-component and the injection of the new $\mathbf{k}$-component. This unification enables explicit control of the shortcut spectrum along a data-dependent direction while retaining stable training behavior. Empirically, replacing Transformer residual additions with DDL improves validation loss and perplexity, as well as downstream evaluation accuracy on language modeling tasks, with larger gains in the expanded-state setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DNA language models are increasingly used to represent genomic sequence, yet their effectiveness depends critically on how raw nucleotides are converted into model inputs. Unlike natural language, DNA offers no canonical boundaries, making fixed tokenizations a brittle design choice under shifts, indels, and local repeats. We introduce \modelname{}, a masked DNA language model that incorporates a learnable adaptive segmentation module to produce context-dependent, variable-length units. Building on a dynamic segmentation procedure, \modelname{} learns to allocate finer granularity to functionally enriched regions while compressing repetitive or redundant sequence. We pre-train \modelname{} on the human reference genome (HG38) and evaluate it on the Nucleotide Transformer and Genomic Benchmarks, where it consistently improves over strong fixed-tokenization baselines. Further analyses and ablations indicate that the learned segmentation is structured rather than incidental: the model preferentially uses shorter units around promoters and exons, and longer units in repetitive regions, yielding representations that are both mutation-resilient and biologically-informed.</description>

      <title>Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks via In-Decoding Safety-Awareness Probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

      <title>Post-LayerNorm Is Back: Stable, ExpressivE, and Deep</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.</description>

      <title>Text-only adaptation in LLM-based ASR through text denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on large language models (LLMs) to new domains using text-only data is a significant yet underexplored challenge. Standard fine-tuning of the LLM on target-domain text often disrupts the critical alignment between speech and text modalities learned by the projector, degrading performance. We introduce a novel text-only adaptation method that emulates the audio projection task by treating it as a text denoising task. Our approach thus trains the LLM to recover clean transcripts from noisy inputs. This process effectively adapts the model to a target domain while preserving cross-modal alignment. Our solution is lightweight, requiring no architectural changes or additional parameters. Extensive evaluation on two datasets demonstrates up to 22.1% relative improvement, outperforming recent state-of-the-art text-only adaptation methods.</description>

      <title>Moral Outrage Shapes Commitments Beyond Attention: Multimodal Moral Emotions on YouTube in Korea and the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how media rhetoric shapes audience engagement is crucial in the attention economy. This study examines how moral emotional framing by mainstream news channels on YouTube influences user behavior across Korea and the United States. To capture the platform's multimodal nature, combining thumbnail images and video titles, we develop a multimodal moral emotion classifier by fine tuning a vision language model. The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting. These findings suggest that moral outrage is a particularly effective emotional strategy, attracting not only attention but also active participation. We discuss concerns about the potential misuse of other condemning rhetoric, as such practices may deepen polarization by reinforcing in group and out group divisions. To facilitate future research and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers.</description>
