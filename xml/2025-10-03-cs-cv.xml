      <title>Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model complexity.</description>

      <title>Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented. Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world generative AI systems.</description>

      <title>On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four modalities.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult. Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing. This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable, capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.</description>

      <title>Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics $\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs, constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance. The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness capabilities of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional, educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev, Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL. Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse, paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral, aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However, differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones. Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold. Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs marketplace.</description>

      <title>Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis. Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2) parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal tests.</description>

      <title>HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.</description>

      <title>FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g., shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Lean yet Powerful Vision-Language Model for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines. Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths, this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will be available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods. This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a single model yields better compression results than using a single method uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Intelligent 5S Audit: Application of Artificial Intelligence for Continuous Improvement in the Automotive Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models (LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa = 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants of different sizes.</description>

      <title>OIG-Bench: A Multi-Agent Annotated Benchmark for Multimodal One-Image Guides Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%. Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset construction.

      <title>Geo-R1: Unlocking VLM Geospatial Reasoning with Cross-View Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a ``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities, and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at https://huggingface.co/miniHui/Geo-R1.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Certifiable Semantic Robustness via Robust Pruning of Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast. However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Improved Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via Unsupervised Subspace Modeling in the Signed Cumulative Distribution Transform Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures. Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MOLM: Mixture of LoRA Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions, susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the extractor.</description>

      <title>Looking Beyond the Known: Towards a Data Discovery Guided Open-World Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting, leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection (CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery (CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain (SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading baselines.</description>

      <title>Discrete Wavelet Transform as a Facilitator for Expressive Latent Space Representation in Variational Autoencoders in Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications. Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation, designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method. Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.</description>

      <title>EgoTraj-Bench: Towards Robust Trajectory Prediction Under Ego-view Noisy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy, first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories, enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of real-world, ego-centric perception.</description>

      <title>David and Goliath in Medical Vision: Convolutional Networks vs Biomedical Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP, across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy: decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's 0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's 0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.</description>

      <title>PAL-UI: Planning with Active Look-back for Vision-Based GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.</description>

      <title>Domain-Specialized Interactive Segmentation Framework for Meningioma Radiotherapy Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT) planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025 Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of 64.8\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning.

      <title>BindWeave: Subject-Consistent Video Generation via Cross-Modal Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming existing open-source and commercial models.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Controlling the Spectral Bias for Self-Supervised Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image. However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images. First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant, without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of SCNet.</description>

      <title>VLOD-TTA: Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Object Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores. First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines.

      <title>MathSticks: A Benchmark for Visual Symbolic Compositional Reasoning with Matchstick Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy.

      <title>Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection.

      <title>Relative-Absolute Fusion: Rethinking Feature Extraction in Image-Based Iterative Method Selection for Solving Sparse Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF (Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset), demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is available at https://github.com/zkqq/BMCMat.</description>

      <title>Affordance-Guided Diffusion Prior for 3D Hand Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses. Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-modal Large Language Models via Progressive Consistency Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework. Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation, respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>CardioBench: Do Echocardiography Foundation Models Generalize Beyond the Lab?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions, high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs. CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional, structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the design of future echocardiography foundation models.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Coarse-to-Fine Hand Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively modeling pose distributions.</description>

      <title>Forestpest-YOLO: A High-Performance Detection Framework for Small Forestry Pests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming established baseline models.</description>

      <title>Assessing Foundation Models for Mold Colony Detection with Limited Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems. Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than traditional models would achieve.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Shared Experts with LoRA-Based Mixture of Experts for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning (STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts (ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts. This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization, and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings, demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Generative Video Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity.

      <description>arXiv:2510.00584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color representation is essential in computer vision and human-computer interaction. There are multiple color models available. The choice of a suitable color model is critical for various applications. This paper presents a review of color models and spaces, analyzing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical applications. We explore traditional models such as RGB, CMYK, and YUV, perceptually uniform spaces like CIELAB and CIELUV, and fuzzy-based approaches as well. Additionally, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate color models from various perspectives, like device dependency, chromatic consistency, and computational complexity. Our experimental results reveal gaps in existing color models and show that the HS* family is the most aligned with human perception. The review also identifies key strengths and limitations of different models and outlines open challenges and future directions This study provides a reference for researchers in image processing, perceptual computing, digital media, and any other color-related field.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Dynamic Style Transfer for NeRFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively transferring stylistic characteristics.</description>

      <title>LVLMs as inspectors: an agentic framework for category-level structural defect annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98% accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98% annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Foreground and Background for vision-Language Navigation via Online Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored. Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations. Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and attains state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG) play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG, sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.</description>

      <title>UCD: Unconditional Discriminator Promotes Nash Equilibrium in GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation, especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise $G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID} on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Virtual Fashion Photo-Shoots: Building a Large-Scale Garment-Lookbook Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast, editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations, and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media. Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.</description>

      <title>LAKAN: Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Face Forgery Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior performance.</description>

      <title>Erased, But Not Forgotten: Erased Rectified Flow Transformers Still Remain Unsafe Under Concept Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies in rectified flow transformers.</description>

      <title>FIN: Fast Inference Network for Map Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline models.</description>

      <title>OTTER: Open-Tagging via Text-Image Representation for Multi-modal Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce OTTER, a unified open-set multi-label tagging framework that harmonizes the stability of a curated, predefined category set with the adaptability of user-driven open tags. OTTER is built upon a large-scale, hierarchically organized multi-modal dataset, collected from diverse online repositories and annotated through a hybrid pipeline combining automated vision-language labeling with human refinement. By leveraging a multi-head attention architecture, OTTER jointly aligns visual and textual representations with both fixed and open-set label embeddings, enabling dynamic and semantically consistent tagging. OTTER consistently outperforms competitive baselines on two benchmark datasets: it achieves an overall F1 score of 0.81 on Otter and 0.75 on Favorite, surpassing the next-best results by margins of 0.10 and 0.02, respectively. OTTER attains near-perfect performance on open-set labels, with F1 of 0.99 on Otter and 0.97 on Favorite, while maintaining competitive accuracy on predefined labels. These results demonstrate OTTER's effectiveness in bridging closed-set consistency with open-vocabulary flexibility for multi-modal tagging applications.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Cloud Detection Combining Spectral Features and Multi-Scale Deep Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results. However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods, leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks. Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1 multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage conditions.</description>

      <title>Align Your Tangent: Training Better Consistency Models via Manifold-Aligned Tangents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent (AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA): Deep Interpretable Clutter Filtering for Ultrasound Microvascular Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However, both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization. A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter. Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated through ablation studies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Domain Brain Vessel Segmentation Through Feature Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner. Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in multiple scenarios accurately.

      <title>A Geometric Unification of Generative AI with Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models, the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM), which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space. We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of image restoration and generation.</description>

      <title>Beyond one-hot encoding? Journey into compact encoding for large multi-class segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting, hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) = 82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8. Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large multi-class segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Event Stream Slicing for Open-Vocabulary Event-Based Object Detection via Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common. Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model, guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network (SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information, our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then processed by CNNs for object detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.

      <title>Graph Integrated Multimodal Concept Bottleneck Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning. MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.</description>

      <title>Training-free Uncertainty Guidance for Complex Visual Tasks with MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective, training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty, enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.</description>

      <title>Deep learning motion correction of quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal smoothness of time-intensity curves (p&lt;0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice = 0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p&lt;0.001). Perfusion maps showed reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39) ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.</description>

      <title>DEAP DIVE: Dataset Investigation with Vision transformers for EEG evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex, resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4 quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points (also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art results of 96,9% with 32 channels.

      <title>Extreme Blind Image Restoration via Prompt-Conditioned Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope. Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality (HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate, less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement, and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.</description>

      <title>Defect Segmentation in OCT scans of ceramic parts for non-destructive inspection using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning (DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score, outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per volume supports its viability for detecting inclusions, enabling more efficient, reliable, and automated quality control.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor for Image-Text Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing, (3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model (LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals.</description>

      <title>ZQBA: Zero Query Black-box Adversarial Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world contexts.

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models with Enhanced Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned binary class-level concept prototypes.</description>

      <title>MetaLogic: Robustness Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models via Logically Equivalent Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation: maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable, ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate, respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Solar PV Installation Potential Assessment on Building Facades Based on Vision and Language Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV) potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation. Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &amp;#177; 2.8% compared to expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100 seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods. Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment.

      <description>arXiv:2510.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of 545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.</description>

      <title>What You See is What You Ask: Evaluating Audio Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight. Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.</description>

      <title>PhraseStereo: The First Open-Vocabulary Stereo Image Segmentation Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception, encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance of this work.</description>

      <title>NSARM: Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling for Robust Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image, which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed, which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page: https://github.com/Xiangtaokong/NSARM</description>

      <title>Feature Identification for Hierarchical Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus, we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by 2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential for applications in computer vision and beyond.</description>

      <title>Can World Models Benefit VLMs for World Dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models, might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.</description>

      <title>Gather-Scatter Mamba: Accelerating Propagation with Efficient State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context, their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential, Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.</description>

      <title>AI-CNet3D: An Anatomically-Informed Cross-Attention Network with Multi-Task Consistency Fine-tuning for 3D Glaucoma Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage, causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance, interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D (AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic performance and comparable GFLOPS.</description>

      <title>Intuitions of Machine Learning Researchers about Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics, this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in transfer learning.</description>

      <title>PAL-Net: A Point-Wise CNN with Patch-Attention for 3D Facial Landmark Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms. Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation.

      <title>Equivariant Splitting: Self-supervised learning from incomplete data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.</description>

      <title>Looking Alike From Far to Near: Enhancing Cross-Resolution Re-Identification via Feature Vector Panning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our model based on the new finding in this paper.</description>

      <title>InfVSR: Breaking Length Limits of Generic Video Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR, achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.</description>

      <title>JEPA-T: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with Text Fusion for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency, open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git</description>

      <title>A Scene is Worth a Thousand Features: Feed-Forward Camera Localization from a Collection of Image Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system. Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses, state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore, FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including challenging large-scale outdoor environments.</description>

      <title>Visual Self-Refinement for Autoregressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction, leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent results.</description>

      <title>SoftCFG: Uncertainty-guided Stable Guidance for Visual autoregressive Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet 256 among autoregressive models.</description>

      <title>TextCAM: Explaining Class Activation Map with Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups, enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious correlations, and preserve model fidelity.</description>

      <title>POVQA: Preference-Optimized Video Question Answering with Rationales for Data Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision. Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame, Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from 0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528. Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot in TVQA.</description>

      <title>ImageDoctor: Diagnosing Text-to-Image Generation via Grounded Image Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics, and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality -- achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.</description>

      <title>Towards Adversarial Training under Hyperspectral Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks. Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets, hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images. Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by 21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign accuracy by 2.68%.</description>

      <title>Secure and reversible face anonymization with diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other previous work.</description>

      <title>Authentic Discrete Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations validate the measurable gains of each component.</description>

      <title>KeySG: Hierarchical Keyframe-Based 3D Scene Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness. Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason, plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms, objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning. Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including 3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Instant4D: 4D Gaussian Splatting in Minutes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic view synthesis has seen significant advances, yet reconstructing scenes from uncalibrated, casual video remains challenging due to slow optimization and complex parameter estimation. In this work, we present Instant4D, a monocular reconstruction system that leverages native 4D representation to efficiently process casual video sequences within minutes, without calibrated cameras or depth sensors. Our method begins with geometric recovery through deep visual SLAM, followed by grid pruning to optimize scene representation. Our design significantly reduces redundancy while maintaining geometric integrity, cutting model size to under 10% of its original footprint. To handle temporal dynamics efficiently, we introduce a streamlined 4D Gaussian representation, achieving a 30x speed-up and reducing training time to within two minutes, while maintaining competitive performance across several benchmarks. Our method reconstruct a single video within 10 minutes on the Dycheck dataset or for a typical 200-frame video. We further apply our model to in-the-wild videos, showcasing its generalizability.

      <title>Strategic Fusion of Vision Language Models: Shapley-Credited Context-Aware Dawid-Skene for Multi-Label Tasks in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label, context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference, converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11 + BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust decision-support component for AV pipelines.</description>

      <title>Code2Video: A Code-centric Paradigm for Educational Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions, limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g., code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency; and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced, discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos. Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.</description>

      <title>EvoWorld: Evolving Panoramic World Generation with Explicit 3D Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process, we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration. Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.</description>

      <title>IMAGEdit: Let Any Subject Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models' understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects, thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/XWH-A/IMAGEdit.</description>

      <title>EVO-LRP: Evolutionary Optimization of LRP for Interpretable Model Explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23585v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Safety in Diabetic Retinopathy Detection: Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning Models with Rejection Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of visual impairment, and effective treatment options depend heavily on timely and accurate diagnosis. Deep learning models have demonstrated great success identifying DR from retinal images. However, relying only on predictions made by models, without any indication of model confidence, creates uncertainty and poses significant risk in clinical settings. This paper investigates an alternative in uncertainty-aware deep learning models, including a rejection mechanism to reject low-confidence predictions, contextualized by deferred decision-making in clinical practice. The results show there is a trade-off between prediction coverage and coverage reliability. The Variational Bayesian model adopted a more conservative strategy when predicting DR, subsequently rejecting the uncertain predictions. The model is evaluated by means of important performance metrics such as Accuracy on accepted predictions, the proportion of accepted cases (coverage), the rejection-ratio, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The findings also demonstrate a clear trade-off between accuracy and caution, establishing that the use of uncertainty estimation and selective rejection improves the model's reliability in safety-critical diagnostic use cases.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray Images: A CNN Approach with Performance Analysis and Clinical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning integration into medical imaging systems has transformed disease detection and diagnosis processes with a focus on pneumonia identification. The study introduces an intricate deep learning system using Convolutional Neural Networks for automated pneumonia detection from chest Xray images which boosts diagnostic precision and speed. The proposed CNN architecture integrates sophisticated methods including separable convolutions along with batch normalization and dropout regularization to enhance feature extraction while reducing overfitting. Through the application of data augmentation techniques and adaptive learning rate strategies the model underwent training on an extensive collection of chest Xray images to enhance its generalization capabilities. A convoluted array of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score collectively verify the model exceptional performance by recording an accuracy rate of 91. This study tackles critical clinical implementation obstacles such as data privacy protection, model interpretability, and integration with current healthcare systems beyond just model performance. This approach introduces a critical advancement by integrating medical ontologies with semantic technology to improve diagnostic accuracy. The study enhances AI diagnostic reliability by integrating machine learning outputs with structured medical knowledge frameworks to boost interpretability. The findings demonstrate AI powered healthcare tools as a scalable efficient pneumonia detection solution. This study advances AI integration into clinical settings by developing more precise automated diagnostic methods that deliver consistent medical imaging results.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Approaches with Explainable AI for Differentiating Alzheimer Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease is critical for effective clinical intervention, particularly in distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive Impairment, a prodromal stage marked by subtle structural changes. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning ensemble framework for Alzheimer Disease classification using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Gray and white matter slices are used as inputs to three pretrained convolutional neural networks such as ResNet50, NASNet, and MobileNet, each fine tuned through an end to end process. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a stacked ensemble learning strategy with a meta learner and weighted averaging to optimally combine the base models. Evaluated on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, the proposed method achieves state of the art accuracy of 99.21% for Alzheimer Disease vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment and 91.0% for Mild Cognitive Impairment vs. Normal Controls, outperforming conventional transfer learning and baseline ensemble methods. To improve interpretability in image based diagnostics, we integrate Explainable AI techniques by Gradient weighted Class Activation, which generates heatmaps and attribution maps that highlight critical regions in gray and white matter slices, revealing structural biomarkers that influence model decisions. These results highlight the frameworks potential for robust and scalable clinical decision support in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Stroke Rehabilitation Domiciliary Assessment System with ST_GCN Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective stroke recovery requires continuous rehabilitation integrated with daily living. To support this need, we propose a home-based rehabilitation exercise and feedback system. The system consists of (1) hardware setup with RGB-D camera and wearable sensors to capture Stroke movements, (2) a mobile application for exercise guidance, and (3) an AI server for assessment and feedback. When Stroke user exercises following the application guidance, the system records skeleton sequences, which are then Assessed by the deep learning model, RAST-G@. The model employs a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) to extract skeletal features and integrates transformer-based temporal attention to figure out action quality. For system implementation, we constructed the NRC dataset, include 10 upper-limb activities of daily living (ADL) and 5 range-of-motion (ROM) collected from stroke and non-disabled participants, with Score annotations provided by licensed physiotherapists. Results on the KIMORE and NRC datasets show that RAST-G@ improves over baseline in terms of MAD, RMSE, and MAPE. Furthermore, the system provides user feedback that combines patient-centered assessment and monitoring. The results demonstrate that the proposed system offers a scalable approach for quantitative and consistent domiciliary rehabilitation assessment.</description>

      <title>Object-AVEdit: An Object-level Audio-Visual Editing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a high demand for audio-visual editing in video post-production and the film making field. While numerous models have explored audio and video editing, they struggle with object-level audio-visual operations. Specifically, object-level audio-visual editing requires the ability to perform object addition, replacement, and removal across both audio and visual modalities, while preserving the structural information of the source instances during the editing process. In this paper, we present \textbf{Object-AVEdit}, achieving the object-level audio-visual editing based on the inversion-regeneration paradigm. To achieve the object-level controllability during editing, we develop a word-to-sounding-object well-aligned audio generation model, bridging the gap in object-controllability between audio and current video generation models. Meanwhile, to achieve the better structural information preservation and object-level editing effect, we propose an inversion-regeneration holistically-optimized editing algorithm, ensuring both information retention during the inversion and better regeneration effect. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our editing model achieved advanced results in both audio-video object-level editing tasks with fine audio-visual semantic alignment. In addition, our developed audio generation model also achieved advanced performance. More results on our project page: https://gewu-lab.github.io/Object_AVEdit-website/.</description>

      <title>Latent Representation Learning from 3D Brain MRI for Interpretable Prediction in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present InfoVAE-Med3D, a latent-representation learning approach for 3D brain MRI that targets interpretable biomarkers of cognitive decline. Standard statistical models and shallow machine learning often lack power, while most deep learning methods behave as black boxes. Our method extends InfoVAE to explicitly maximize mutual information between images and latent variables, producing compact, structured embeddings that retain clinically meaningful content. We evaluate on two cohorts: a large healthy-control dataset (n=6527) with chronological age, and a clinical multiple sclerosis dataset from Charles University in Prague (n=904) with age and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) scores. The learned latents support accurate brain-age and SDMT regression, preserve key medical attributes, and form intuitive clusters that aid interpretation. Across reconstruction and downstream prediction tasks, InfoVAE-Med3D consistently outperforms other VAE variants, indicating stronger information capture in the embedding space. By uniting predictive performance with interpretability, InfoVAE-Med3D offers a practical path toward MRI-based biomarkers and more transparent analysis of cognitive deterioration in neurological disease.</description>

      <title>DPsurv: Dual-Prototype Evidential Fusion for Uncertainty-Aware and Interpretable Whole-Slide Image Survival Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) are widely used for cancer survival analysis because of their comprehensive histopathological information at both cellular and tissue levels, enabling quantitative, large-scale, and prognostically rich tumor feature analysis. However, most existing methods in WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of DPsurv.</description>

      <title>Adapting Large Language Models to Mitigate Skin Tone Biases in Clinical Dermatology Tasks: A Mixed-Methods Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SkinGPT-4, a large vision-language model, leverages annotated skin disease images to augment clinical workflows in underserved communities. However, its training dataset predominantly represents lighter skin tones, limiting diagnostic accuracy for darker tones. Here, we evaluated performance biases in SkinGPT-4 across skin tones on common skin diseases, including eczema, allergic-contact dermatitis, and psoriasis using the open-sourced SCIN dataset. We leveraged the SkinGPT-4 backbone to develop finetuned models for custom skin disease classification tasks and explored bias mitigation strategies. Clinical evaluation by board-certified dermatologists on six relevant skin diseases from 300 SCIN cases assessed images for diagnostic accuracy, informativity, physician utility, and patient utility. Model fairness metrics, including demographic parity and equalized odds, were calculated across skin tones. SkinGPT-4 achieved an average demographic parity of 0.10 across Fitzpatrick types, with notable differences of 0.10-0.15 between lightest and darkest tones across evaluation metrics. Model hallucinations in artifacts and anatomy occurred at a rate of 17.8. Our customized models achieved average F1, precision, and AUROC of 0.75, 0.78, and 0.78 across visually similar disease pairs. Fairness analysis showed an average demographic parity of 0.75, with a maximum disparity of 0.21 across skin tones. The best model achieved parity scores of 0.83, 0.83, 0.76, 0.89, 0.90, and 0.90 for Fitzpatrick I-VI, indicating robust fairness. Large language models such as SkinGPT-4 showed weaker performance on darker tones. Model biases exist across evaluation criteria, and hallucinations may affect diagnostic efficacy. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of training accurate, fair models using existing backbones for custom skin disease classification.</description>

      <title>Variable Rate Image Compression via N-Gram Context based Swin-transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an N-gram context-based Swin Transformer for learned image compression. Our method achieves variable-rate compression with a single model. By incorporating N-gram context into the Swin Transformer, we overcome its limitation of neglecting larger regions during high-resolution image reconstruction due to its restricted receptive field. This enhancement expands the regions considered for pixel restoration, thereby improving the quality of high-resolution reconstructions. Our method increases context awareness across neighboring windows, leading to a -5.86\% improvement in BD-Rate over existing variable-rate learned image compression techniques. Additionally, our model improves the quality of regions of interest (ROI) in images, making it particularly beneficial for object-focused applications in fields such as manufacturing and industrial vision systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Osteoporosis silently erodes skeletal integrity worldwide; however, early detection through imaging can prevent most fragility fractures. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods now mine routine Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans for subtle, clinically actionable markers, but the literature is fragmented. This survey unifies the field through a tri-axial framework that couples imaging modalities with clinical tasks and AI methodologies (classical machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, self-supervised learning, and explainable AI). Following a concise clinical and technical primer, we detail our Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-guided search strategy, introduce the taxonomy via a roadmap figure, and synthesize cross-study insights on data scarcity, external validation, and interpretability. By identifying emerging trends, open challenges, and actionable research directions, this review provides AI scientists, medical imaging researchers, and musculoskeletal clinicians with a clear compass to accelerate rigorous, patient-centered innovation in osteoporosis care. The project page of this survey can also be found on Github.</description>

      <title>Behavioural Classification in C. elegans: a Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural classification process.</description>

      <title>Learning Energy-based Variational Latent Prior for VAEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation, high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches. The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior holes, and better sampling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Motion In-Betweening for Densely Interacting Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion in-betweening is the problem to synthesize movement between keyposes. Traditional research focused primarily on single characters. Extending them to densely interacting characters is highly challenging, as it demands precise spatial-temporal correspondence between the characters to maintain the interaction, while creating natural transitions towards predefined keyposes. In this research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening that enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To effectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution called Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each character across different conditioning representation spaces. We further observe that the significantly increased constraints in interacting characters heavily limit the solution space, leading to degraded motion quality and diminished interaction over time. To enable long-horizon synthesis, we present two solutions to maintain long-term interaction and motion quality, thereby keeping synthesis in the stable region of the solution space.We first sustain interaction quality by identifying periodic interaction patterns through adversarial learning. We further maintain the motion quality by learning to refine the drifted latent space and prevent pose error accumulation. We demonstrate that our approach produces realistic, controllable, and long-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and dancing actions across multiple keyposes, supported by extensive quantitative evaluations and user studies.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Pipeline for Epilepsy Genomic Analysis Using GPT-2 XL and NVIDIA H100</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures, with global prevalence estimated at 50 million people worldwide. While progress in high-throughput sequencing has allowed for broad-based transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues, the deciphering of these highly complex datasets remains one of the challenges. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new analysis pipeline that integrates the power of deep learning strategies with GPU-acceleration computation for investigating Gene expression patterns in epilepsy. Specifically, our proposed approach employs GPT-2 XL, a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) with 1.5 billion parameters for genomic sequence analysis over the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs based on Hopper architecture. Our proposed method enables efficient preprocessing of RNA sequence data, gene sequence encoding, and subsequent pattern identification. We conducted experiments on two epilepsy datasets including GEO accession GSE264537 and GSE275235. The obtained results reveal several significant transcriptomic modifications, including reduced hippocampal astrogliosis after ketogenic diet treatment as well as restored excitatory-inhibitory signaling equilibrium in zebrafish epilepsy model. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs in combination with advanced hardware acceleration for transcriptomic characterization in neurological diseases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable embodied decision-making but rely heavily on imitation learning, leading to compounding errors and poor robustness under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator. Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense, trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the generalization and robustness of VLA models.

      <title>Plug-and-Play Prompt Refinement via Latent Feedback for Diffusion Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory, thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement. Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Data Augmentation via Gradient-Guided and Sample-Aware Influence Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window. Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning. Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the method's effectiveness and practicality.</description>

      <title>Rehearsal-free and Task-free Online Continual Learning With Contrastive Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}. Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning. Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD), and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2, we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2 baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting rather than a helpful shortcut.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Precise Method for Searching Rectangular Tumor Regions in Brain MR Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a fast and precise method for searching rectangular regions in brain tumor images. Methods: The authors propose a new method for searching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images. The proposed method consisted of a segmentation network and a fast search method with a user-controllable search metric. As the segmentation network, the U-Net whose encoder was replaced by the EfficientNet was used. In the fast search method, summed-area tables were used for accelerating sums of voxels in rectangular regions. Use of the summed-area tables enabled exhaustive search of the 3D offset (3D full search). The search metric was designed for giving priority to cubes over oblongs, and assigning better values for higher tumor fractions even if they exceeded target tumor fractions. The proposed computation and metric were compared with those used in a conventional method using the Brain Tumor Image Segmentation dataset. Results: When the 3D full search was used, the proposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than the conventional computation (11-40 minutes). When the user-controllable parts of the search metrics were changed variously, the tumor fractions of the proposed metric were higher than those of the conventional metric. In addition, the conventional metric preferred oblongs whereas the proposed metric preferred cubes. Conclusion: The proposed method is promising for implementing fast and precise search of rectangular tumor regions, which is useful for brain tumor diagnosis using MRI systems. The proposed computation reduced processing times of the 3D full search, and the proposed metric improved the quality of the assigned rectangular tumor regions.</description>

      <title>VIRTUE: Visual-Interactive Text-Image Universal Embedder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models (VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn entity-level information within images to complement their global representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.</description>

      <title>U-DFA: A Unified DINOv2-Unet with Dual Fusion Attention for Multi-Dataset Medical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in overall diagnosis and is one of the most essential tasks in the diagnostic pipeline. CNN-based models, despite their extensive use, suffer from a local receptive field and fail to capture the global context. A common approach that combines CNNs with transformers attempts to bridge this gap but fails to effectively fuse the local and global features. With the recent emergence of VLMs and foundation models, they have been adapted for downstream medical imaging tasks; however, they suffer from an inherent domain gap and high computational cost. To this end, we propose U-DFA, a unified DINOv2-Unet encoder-decoder architecture that integrates a novel Local-Global Fusion Adapter (LGFA) to enhance segmentation performance. LGFA modules inject spatial features from a CNN-based Spatial Pattern Adapter (SPA) module into frozen DINOv2 blocks at multiple stages, enabling effective fusion of high-level semantic and spatial features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Synapse and ACDC datasets with only 33\% of the trainable model parameters. These results demonstrate that U-DFA is a robust and scalable framework for medical image segmentation across multiple modalities.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Training for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a. Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions. However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features, thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and image reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and trustworthy AI systems.</description>

      <title>HAMLET: Switch your Vision-Language-Action Model into a History-Aware Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context. In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of 76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from 64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Activation-Deactivation: A General Framework for Robust Post-hoc Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size, and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without the need for domain knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the widely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional distributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable alternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance, resulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD (ReSWD), which integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively retain informative projection directions in optimization steps, resulting in stable gradients while remaining unbiased. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks such as color correction and diffusion guidance show that ReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction baselines.

      <title>EditTrack: Detecting and Attributing AI-assisted Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we formulate and study the problem of image-editing detection and attribution: given a base image and a suspicious image, detection seeks to determine whether the suspicious image was derived from the base image using an AI editing model, while attribution further identifies the specific editing model responsible. Existing methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated images are insufficient for this problem, as they focus on determining whether an image was AI-generated/edited rather than whether it was edited from a particular base image. To bridge this gap, we propose EditTrack, the first framework for this image-editing detection and attribution problem. Building on four key observations about the editing process, EditTrack introduces a novel re-editing strategy and leverages carefully designed similarity metrics to determine whether a suspicious image originates from a base image and, if so, by which model. We evaluate EditTrack on five state-of-the-art editing models across six datasets, demonstrating that it consistently achieves accurate detection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines.</description>

Abstract: We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time, which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving real-time performance (&lt;15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed. We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various scenarios such as multilingual speeches.</description>

      <title>ZoDIAC: Zoneout Dropout Injection Attention Calculation</title>

Abstract: In the past few years the transformer model has been utilized for a variety of tasks such as image captioning, image classification natural language generation, and natural language understanding. As a key component of the transformer model, self-attention calculates the attention values by mapping the relationships among the head elements of the source and target sequence, yet there is no explicit mechanism to refine and intensify the attention values with respect to the context of the input and target sequences. Based on this intuition, we introduce a novel refine and intensify attention mechanism that is called Zoneup Dropout Injection Attention Calculation (ZoDIAC), in which the intensities of attention values in the elements of the input source and target sequences are first refined using GELU and dropout and then intensified using a proposed zoneup process which includes the injection of a learned scalar factor. Our extensive experiments show that ZoDIAC achieves statistically significant higher scores under all image captioning metrics using various feature extractors in comparison to the conventional self-attention module in the transformer model on the MS-COCO dataset. Our proposed ZoDIAC attention modules can be used as a drop-in replacement for the attention components in all transformer models.

      <title>Towards More Accurate Diffusion Model Acceleration with A Timestep Tuner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A diffusion model, which is formulated to produce an image using thousands of denoising steps, usually suffers from a slow inference speed. Existing acceleration algorithms simplify the sampling by skipping most steps yet exhibit considerable performance degradation. By viewing the generation of diffusion models as a discretized integral process, we argue that the quality drop is partly caused by applying an inaccurate integral direction to a timestep interval. To rectify this issue, we propose a \textbf{timestep tuner} that helps find a more accurate integral direction for a particular interval at the minimum cost. Specifically, at each denoising step, we replace the original parameterization by conditioning the network on a new timestep, enforcing the sampling distribution towards the real one. Extensive experiments show that our plug-in design can be trained efficiently and boost the inference performance of various state-of-the-art acceleration methods, especially when there are few denoising steps. For example, when using 10 denoising steps on LSUN Bedroom dataset, we improve the FID of DDIM from 9.65 to 6.07, simply by adopting our method for a more appropriate set of timesteps.

      <title>Achieving More Human Brain-Like Vision via Human EEG Representational Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite advancements in artificial intelligence, object recognition models still lag behind in emulating visual information processing in human brains. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using neural data to mimic brain processing; however, these often rely on invasive neural recordings from non-human subjects, leaving a critical gap in understanding human visual perception. Addressing this gap, we present, 'Re(presentational)Al(ignment)net', a vision model aligned with human brain activity based on non-invasive EEG, demonstrating a significantly higher similarity to human brain representations. Our innovative image-to-brain multi-layer encoding framework advances human neural alignment by optimizing multiple model layers and enabling the model to efficiently learn and mimic the human brain's visual representational patterns across object categories and different modalities. Our findings suggest that ReAlnets better align artificial neural networks with human brain representations, making it more similar to human brain processing than traditional computer vision models, which takes an important step toward bridging the gap between artificial and human vision and achieving more brain-like artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Unconstrained Head Pose Estimation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02544v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing research on unconstrained in-the-wild head pose estimation suffers from the flaws of its datasets, which consist of either numerous samples by non-realistic synthesis or constrained collection, or small-scale natural images yet with plausible manual annotations. This makes fully-supervised solutions compromised due to the reliance on generous labels. To alleviate it, we propose the first semi-supervised unconstrained head pose estimation method SemiUHPE, which can leverage abundant easily available unlabeled head images. Technically, we choose semi-supervised rotation regression and adapt it to the error-sensitive and label-scarce problem of unconstrained head pose. Our method is based on the observation that the aspect-ratio invariant cropping of wild heads is superior to previous landmark-based affine alignment given that landmarks of unconstrained human heads are usually unavailable, especially for underexplored non-frontal heads. Instead of using a pre-fixed threshold to filter out pseudo labeled heads, we propose dynamic entropy based filtering to adaptively remove unlabeled outliers as training progresses by updating the threshold in multiple stages. We then revisit the design of weak-strong augmentations and improve it by devising two novel head-oriented strong augmentations, termed pose-irrelevant cut-occlusion and pose-altering rotation consistency respectively. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that SemiUHPE outperforms its counterparts greatly on public benchmarks under both the front-range and full-range settings. Furthermore, our proposed method is also beneficial for solving other closely related problems, including generic object rotation regression and 3D head reconstruction, demonstrating good versatility and extensibility.

      <title>Scheduling Weight Transitions for Quantization-Aware Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19248v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) simulates a quantization process during training to lower bit-precision of weights/activations. It learns quantized weights indirectly by updating latent weights,i.e., full-precision inputs to a quantizer, using gradient-based optimizers. We claim that coupling a user-defined learning rate (LR) with these optimizers is sub-optimal for QAT. Quantized weights transit discrete levels of a quantizer, only if corresponding latent weights pass transition points, where the quantizer changes discrete states. This suggests that the changes of quantized weights are affected by both the LR for latent weights and their distributions. It is thus difficult to control the degree of changes for quantized weights by scheduling the LR manually. We conjecture that the degree of parameter changes in QAT is related to the number of quantized weights transiting discrete levels. Based on this, we introduce a transition rate (TR) scheduling technique that controls the number of transitions of quantized weights explicitly. Instead of scheduling a LR for latent weights, we schedule a target TR of quantized weights, and update the latent weights with a novel transition-adaptive LR (TALR), enabling considering the degree of changes for the quantized weights during QAT. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>HR-INR: Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution via Event Camera</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) aims to simultaneously enhance video resolution and frame rate at an arbitrary scale. Recently, implicit neural representation (INR) has been applied to video restoration, representing videos as implicit fields that can be decoded at an arbitrary scale. However, existing INR-based C-STVSR methods typically rely on only two frames as input, leading to insufficient inter-frame motion information. Consequently, they struggle to capture fast, complex motion and long-term dependencies (spanning more than three frames), hindering their performance in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel C-STVSR framework, named HR-INR, which captures both holistic dependencies and regional motions based on INR. It is assisted by an event camera -- a novel sensor renowned for its high temporal resolution and low latency. To fully utilize the rich temporal information from events, we design a feature extraction consisting of (1) a regional event feature extractor -- taking events as inputs via the proposed event temporal pyramid representation to capture the regional nonlinear motion and (2) a holistic event-frame feature extractor for long-term dependence and continuity motion. We then propose a novel INR-based decoder with spatiotemporal embeddings to capture long-term dependencies with a larger temporal perception field. We validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method on four datasets (both simulated and real data), showing the superiority of our method.

      <title>DPDETR: Decoupled Position Detection Transformer for Infrared-Visible Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection aims to achieve robust object detection by leveraging the complementary information of infrared and visible image pairs. However, the commonly existing modality misalignment problem presents two challenges: fusing misalignment complementary features is difficult, and current methods cannot reliably locate objects in both modalities under misalignment conditions. In this paper, we propose a Decoupled Position Detection Transformer (DPDETR) to address these issues. Specifically, we explicitly define the object category, visible modality position, and infrared modality position to enable the network to learn the intrinsic relationships and output reliably positions of objects in both modalities. To fuse misaligned object features reliably, we propose a Decoupled Position Multispectral Cross-attention module that adaptively samples and aggregates multispectral complementary features with the constraint of infrared and visible reference positions. Additionally, we design a query-decoupled Multispectral Decoder structure to address the the conflict in feature focus among the three kinds of object information in our task and propose a Decoupled Position Contrastive DeNoising Training strategy to enhance the DPDETR's ability to learn decoupled positions. Experiments on DroneVehicle and KAIST datasets demonstrate significant improvements compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>SL$^{2}$A-INR: Single-Layer Learnable Activation for Implicit Neural Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10836v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR), leveraging a neural network to transform coordinate input into corresponding attributes, has recently driven significant advances in several vision-related domains. However, the performance of INR is heavily influenced by the choice of the nonlinear activation function used in its multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture. To date, multiple nonlinearities have been investigated, but current INRs still face limitations in capturing high-frequency components and diverse signal types. We show that these challenges can be alleviated by introducing a novel approach in INR architecture. Specifically, we propose SL$^{2}$A-INR, a hybrid network that combines a single-layer learnable activation function with an MLP that uses traditional ReLU activations. Our method performs superior across diverse tasks, including image representation, 3D shape reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Through comprehensive experiments, SL$^{2}$A-INR sets new benchmarks in accuracy, quality, and robustness for INR. Our Code is publicly available on~\href{https://github.com/Iceage7/SL2A-INR}{\textcolor{magenta}{GitHub}}.</description>

      <title>Source-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection with Semantics Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong data augmentation is a fundamental component of state-of-the-art mean teacher-based Source-Free domain adaptive Object Detection (SFOD) methods, enabling consistency-based self-supervised optimization along weak augmentation. However, our theoretical analysis and empirical observations reveal a critical limitation: strong augmentation can inadvertently erase class-relevant components, leading to artificial inter-category confusion. To address this issue, we introduce Weak-to-strong Semantics Compensation (WSCo), a novel remedy that leverages weakly augmented images, which preserve full semantics, as anchors to enrich the feature space of their strongly augmented counterparts. Essentially, this compensates for the class-relevant semantics that may be lost during strong augmentation on the fly. Notably, WSCo can be implemented as a generic plug-in, easily integrable with any existing SFOD pipelines. Extensive experiments validate the negative impact of strong augmentation on detection performance, and the effectiveness of WSCo in enhancing the performance of previous detection models on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Rectified Diffusion Guidance for Conditional Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which combines the conditional and unconditional score functions with two coefficients summing to one, serves as a practical technique for diffusion model sampling. Theoretically, however, denoising with CFG \textit{cannot} be expressed as a reciprocal diffusion process, which may consequently leave some hidden risks during use. In this work, we revisit the theory behind CFG and rigorously confirm that the improper configuration of the combination coefficients (\textit{i.e.}, the widely used summing-to-one version) brings about expectation shift of the generative distribution. To rectify this issue, we propose ReCFG with a relaxation on the guidance coefficients such that denoising with \method strictly aligns with the diffusion theory. We further show that our approach enjoys a \textbf{\textit{closed-form}} solution given the guidance strength. That way, the rectified coefficients can be readily pre-computed via traversing the observed data, leaving the sampling speed barely affected. Empirical evidence on real-world data demonstrate the compatibility of our post-hoc design with existing state-of-the-art diffusion models, including both class-conditioned ones (\textit{e.g.}, EDM2 on ImageNet) and text-conditioned ones (\textit{e.g.}, SD3 on CC12M), without any retraining.

      <title>Dressing the Imagination: A Dataset for AI-Powered Translation of Text into Fashion Outfits and A Novel KAN Adapter for Enhanced Feature Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Specialized datasets that capture the fashion industry's rich language and styling elements can boost progress in AI-driven fashion design. We present FLORA, (Fashion Language Outfit Representation for Apparel Generation), the first comprehensive dataset containing 4,330 curated pairs of fashion outfits and corresponding textual descriptions. Each description utilizes industry-specific terminology and jargon commonly used by professional fashion designers, providing precise and detailed insights into the outfits. Hence, the dataset captures the delicate features and subtle stylistic elements necessary to create high-fidelity fashion designs.
  We demonstrate that fine-tuning generative models on the FLORA dataset significantly enhances their capability to generate accurate and stylistically rich images from textual descriptions of fashion sketches. FLORA will catalyze the creation of advanced AI models capable of comprehending and producing subtle, stylistically rich fashion designs. It will also help fashion designers and end-users to bring their ideas to life.
  As a second orthogonal contribution, we introduce NeRA (Nonlinear low-rank Expressive Representation Adapter), a novel adapter architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). Unlike traditional PEFT techniques such as LoRA, LoKR, DoRA, and LoHA that use MLP adapters, NeRA uses learnable spline-based nonlinear transformations, enabling superior modeling of complex semantic relationships, achieving strong fidelity, faster convergence and semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on our proposed FLORA and LAION-5B datasets validate the superiority of NeRA over existing adapters.
  We will open-source both the FLORA dataset and our implementation code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation is a challenging task in digital communication. Despite significant progress in the area, most existing methods concentrate on audio-lip synchronization, often overlooking aspects such as visual quality, customization, and generalization that are crucial to producing realistic talking faces. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, customizable one-shot audio-driven talking face generation framework, named PortraitTalk. Our proposed method utilizes a latent diffusion framework consisting of two main components: IdentityNet and AnimateNet. IdentityNet is designed to preserve identity features consistently across the generated video frames, while AnimateNet aims to enhance temporal coherence and motion consistency. This framework also integrates an audio input with the reference images, thereby reducing the reliance on reference-style videos prevalent in existing approaches. A key innovation of PortraitTalk is the incorporation of text prompts through decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, which significantly expands creative control over the generated videos. Through extensive experiments, including a newly developed evaluation metric, our model demonstrates superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for the generation of customizable realistic talking faces suitable for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model as a Noise-Aware Latent Reward Model for Step-Level Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preference optimization for diffusion models aims to align them with human preferences for images. Previous methods typically use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as pixel-level reward models to approximate human preferences. However, when used for step-level preference optimization, these models face challenges in handling noisy images of different timesteps and require complex transformations into pixel space. In this work, we show that pre-trained diffusion models are naturally suited for step-level reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process latent images at various noise levels. Accordingly, we propose the Latent Reward Model (LRM), which repurposes components of the diffusion model to predict preferences of latent images at arbitrary timesteps. Building on LRM, we introduce Latent Preference Optimization (LPO), a step-level preference optimization method conducted directly in the noisy latent space. Experimental results indicate that LPO significantly improves the model's alignment with general, aesthetic, and text-image alignment preferences, while achieving a 2.5-28x training speedup over existing preference optimization methods. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/LPO.</description>

      <title>SafeEraser: Enhancing Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models through Multimodal Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12520v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop, their potential security issues have become increasingly prominent. Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended.</description>

      <title>SEE: See Everything Every Time -- Adaptive Brightness Adjustment for Broad Light Range Images via Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event cameras, with a high dynamic range exceeding $120dB$, significantly outperform traditional embedded cameras, robustly recording detailed changing information under various lighting conditions, including both low- and high-light situations. However, recent research on utilizing event data has primarily focused on low-light image enhancement, neglecting image enhancement and brightness adjustment across a broader range of lighting conditions, such as normal or high illumination. Based on this, we propose a novel research question: how to employ events to enhance and adaptively adjust the brightness of images captured under broad lighting conditions? To investigate this question, we first collected a new dataset, SEE-600K, consisting of 610,126 images and corresponding events across 202 scenarios, each featuring an average of four lighting conditions with over a 1000-fold variation in illumination. Subsequently, we propose a framework that effectively utilizes events to smoothly adjust image brightness through the use of prompts. Our framework captures color through sensor patterns, uses cross-attention to model events as a brightness dictionary, and adjusts the image's dynamic range to form a broad light-range representation (BLR), which is then decoded at the pixel level based on the brightness prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only performs well on the low-light enhancement dataset but also shows robust performance on broader light-range image enhancement using the SEE-600K dataset. Additionally, our approach enables pixel-level brightness adjustment, providing flexibility for post-processing and inspiring more imaging applications. The dataset and source code are publicly available at: https://github.com/yunfanLu/SEE.</description>

      <title>BlobCtrl: Taming Controllable Blob for Element-level Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As user expectations for image editing continue to rise, the demand for flexible, fine-grained manipulation of specific visual elements presents a challenge for current diffusion-based methods. In this work, we present BlobCtrl, a framework for element-level image editing based on a probabilistic blob-based representation. Treating blobs as visual primitives, BlobCtrl disentangles layout from appearance, affording fine-grained, controllable object-level manipulation. Our key contributions are twofold: (1) an in-context dual-branch diffusion model that separates foreground and background processing, incorporating blob representations to explicitly decouple layout and appearance, and (2) a self-supervised disentangle-then-reconstruct training paradigm with an identity-preserving loss function, along with tailored strategies to efficiently leverage blob-image pairs. To foster further research, we introduce BlobData for large-scale training and BlobBench, a benchmark for systematic evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that BlobCtrl achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of element-level editing tasks, such as object addition, removal, scaling, and replacement, while maintaining computational efficiency.

      <title>Beyond Semantics: Rediscovering Spatial Awareness in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at identifying and describing objects but often fail at spatial reasoning. We study why VLMs, such as LLaVA, underutilize spatial cues despite having positional encodings and spatially rich vision encoder features. Our analysis reveals a key imbalance: vision token embeddings have much larger norms than text tokens, suppressing LLM's position embedding. To expose this mechanism, we developed three interpretability tools: (1) the Position Sensitivity Index, which quantifies reliance on token order, (2) the Cross Modality Balance, which reveals attention head allocation patterns, and (3) a RoPE Sensitivity probe, which measures dependence on rotary positional embeddings. These tools uncover that vision tokens and system prompts dominate attention. We validated our mechanistic understanding through targeted interventions that predictably restore positional sensitivity. These findings reveal previously unknown failure modes in multimodal attention and demonstrate how interpretability analysis can guide principled improvements.</description>

      <title>Easi3R: Estimating Disentangled Motion from DUSt3R Without Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point clouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network architectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast, the limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major bottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has driven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video data with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this work, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient training-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention adaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training or network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently encode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully disentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region segmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our lightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic datasets. Our code is publicly available for research purpose at https://easi3r.github.io/</description>

      <title>GUI-R1 : A Generalist R1-Style Vision-Language Action Model For GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing efforts in building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents largely rely on the training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoencoder (AE) is the key to the success of latent diffusion models for image and video generation, reducing the denoising resolution and improving efficiency. However, the power of AE has long been underexplored in terms of network design, compression ratio, and training strategy. In this work, we systematically examine the architecture design choices and optimize the computation distribution to obtain a series of efficient and high-compression video AEs that can decode in real time even on mobile devices. We also propose an omni-training objective to unify the design of plain Autoencoder and image-conditioned I2V VAE, achieving multifunctionality in a single VAE network but with enhanced quality. In addition, we propose a novel latent consistency loss that provides stable improvements in reconstruction quality. Latent consistency loss outperforms prior auxiliary losses including LPIPS, GAN and DWT in terms of both quality improvements and simplicity. H3AE achieves ultra-high compression ratios and real-time decoding speed on GPU and mobile, and outperforms prior arts in terms of reconstruction metrics by a large margin. We finally validate our AE by training a DiT on its latent space and demonstrate fast, high-quality text-to-video generation capability.</description>

      <title>Robustness and sex differences in skin cancer detection: logistic regression vs CNNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has been reported to achieve high performances in the detection of skin cancer, yet many challenges regarding the reproducibility of results and biases remain. This study is a replication (different data, same analysis) of a previous study on Alzheimer's disease detection, which studied the robustness of logistic regression (LR) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) across patient sexes. We explore sex bias in skin cancer detection, using the PAD-UFES-20 dataset with LR trained on handcrafted features reflecting dermatological guidelines (ABCDE and the 7-point checklist), and a pre-trained ResNet-50 model. We evaluate these models in alignment with the replicated study: across multiple training datasets with varied sex composition to determine their robustness. Our results show that both the LR and the CNN were robust to the sex distribution, but the results also revealed that the CNN had a significantly higher accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) for male patients compared to female patients. The data and relevant scripts to reproduce our results are publicly available (https://github.com/ nikodice4/Skin-cancer-detection-sex-bias).</description>

      <title>SpikeGen: Decoupled "Rods and Cones" Visual Representation Processing with Latent Generative Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process through which humans perceive and learn visual representations in dynamic environments is highly complex. From a structural perspective, the human eye decouples the functions of cone and rod cells: cones are primarily responsible for color perception, while rods are specialized in detecting motion, particularly variations in light intensity. These two distinct modalities of visual information are integrated and processed within the visual cortex, thereby enhancing the robustness of the human visual system. Inspired by this biological mechanism, modern hardware systems have evolved to include not only color-sensitive RGB cameras but also motion-sensitive Dynamic Visual Systems, such as spike cameras. Building upon these advancements, this study seeks to emulate the human visual system by integrating decomposed multi-modal visual inputs with modern latent-space generative frameworks. We named it SpikeGen. We evaluate its performance across various spike-RGB tasks, including conditional image and video deblurring, dense frame reconstruction from spike streams, and high-speed scene novel-view synthesis. Supported by extensive experiments, we demonstrate that leveraging the latent space manipulation capabilities of generative models enables an effective synergistic enhancement of different visual modalities, addressing spatial sparsity in spike inputs and temporal sparsity in RGB inputs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) typically build on ViTs (e.g., CLIP), yet their training with simple random in-batch negatives limits the ability to capture fine-grained visual differences, particularly in geometric scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code, and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on caption similarity. We train a vision encoder (CLIP) using our hard negative training method, namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM, significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models like GPT-4o. We further conduct ablation studies to analyze three key factors: hard negative types, the efficiency of image-based negatives, and training configurations. These analyses yield important insights into optimizing the training pipeline of vision encoder for fine-grained geometric reasoning tasks. https://github.com/THU-KEG/MMGeoLM.</description>

      <title>STORK: Faster Diffusion And Flow Matching Sampling By Resolving Both Stiffness And Structure-Dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) and flow-matching models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image and video generation. However, such models require a significant number of function evaluations (NFEs) during sampling, leading to costly inference. Consequently, quality-preserving fast sampling methods that require fewer NFEs have been an active area of research. However, prior training-free sampling methods fail to simultaneously address two key challenges: the stiffness of the ODE (i.e., the non-straightness of the velocity field) and dependence on the semi-linear structure of the DM ODE (which limits their direct applicability to flow-matching models). In this work, we introduce the Stabilized Taylor Orthogonal Runge--Kutta (STORK) method, addressing both design concerns. We demonstrate that STORK consistently improves the quality of diffusion and flow-matching sampling for image and video generation.

      <title>Text-to-CT Generation via 3D Latent Diffusion Model with Contrastive Vision-Language Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: While recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have enabled the synthesis of realistic medical images, progress has been largely confined to 2D modalities such as chest X-rays. Extending text-to-image generation to volumetric CT remains a significant challenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the absence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical imaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation that combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language pretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model trained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared embedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation. CT volumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space via a pretrained volumetric VAE, enabling efficient 3D denoising diffusion without requiring external super-resolution stages. Results: We evaluate our method on the CT-RATE dataset and conduct a comprehensive assessment of image fidelity, clinical relevance, and semantic alignment. Our model achieves competitive performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming prior baselines for text-to-CT generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that CT scans synthesized by our framework can effectively augment real data, improving downstream diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Our results show that modality-specific vision-language alignment is a key component for high-quality 3D medical image generation. By integrating contrastive pretraining and volumetric diffusion, our method offers a scalable and controllable solution for synthesizing clinically meaningful CT volumes from text, paving the way for new applications in data augmentation, medical education, and automated clinical simulation.

      <title>ATAS: Any-to-Any Self-Distillation for Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Dense Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders, preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.</description>

Current preference alignment techniques for 3D content typically rely on hardly-collected preference-paired multi-view 2D images to train 2D reward models, when then guide 3D generation -- leading to geometric artifacts due to their inherent 2D bias. To address these limitations, we construct 3D-MeshPref, the first large-scale unpaired 3D preference dataset, featuring diverse 3D meshes annotated by a large language model and refined by human evaluators. We then develop RewardCS, the first reward model trained directly on unpaired 3D-MeshPref data using a novel Cauchy-Schwarz divergence objective, enabling effective learning of human-aligned 3D geometric preferences without requiring paired comparisons. Building on this, we propose DreamCS, a unified framework that integrates RewardCS into text-to-3D pipelines -- enhancing both implicit and explicit 3D generation with human preference feedback. Extensive experiments show DreamCS outperforms prior methods, producing 3D assets that are both geometrically faithful and human-preferred. Code and models will be released publicly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for automatic GUI component detection for the IBM i system (formerly and still more commonly known as AS/400). We introduce a human-annotated dataset consisting of 1,050 system screen images, in which 381 images are screenshots of IBM i system screens in Japanese. Each image contains multiple components, including text labels, text boxes, options, tables, instructions, keyboards, and command lines. We then develop a detection system based on state-of-the-art deep learning models and evaluate different approaches using our dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset in constructing a system for component detection from GUI screens. By automatically detecting GUI components from the screen, AS400-DET has the potential to perform automated testing on systems that operate via GUI screens.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering from a Single Transmitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly challenging, especially under sparse transmitter setups, e.g., with only one transmitter. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it requires time-consuming case-specific optimization and fails under sparse transmitter setups. To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a data-driven perspective. The scarcity of transmitters leads to an insufficient amount of measured data, which fails to capture adequate physical information for stable inversion. Built on this insight, we propose a fully end-to-end and data-driven framework that predicts the relative permittivity of scatterers from measured fields, leveraging data distribution priors to compensate for the lack of physical information. This design enables data-driven training and feed-forward prediction of relative permittivity while maintaining strong robustness to transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy and robustness. Notably, it achieves high-quality results even with a single transmitter, a setting where previous methods consistently fail. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical solutions for electromagnetic imaging.</description>

      <title>Learning Frequency and Memory-Aware Prompts for Multi-Modal Object Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have made strong progress by using lightweight visual adapters to inject auxiliary-modality cues into frozen foundation models. However, they still underutilize two essentials: modality-specific frequency structure and long-range temporal dependencies. We present Learning Frequency and Memory-Aware Prompts, a dual-adapter framework that injects lightweight prompts into a frozen RGB tracker. A frequency-guided visual adapter adaptively transfers complementary cues across modalities by jointly calibrating spatial, channel, and frequency components, narrowing the modality gap without full fine-tuning. A multilevel memory adapter with short, long, and permanent memory stores, updates, and retrieves reliable temporal context, enabling consistent propagation across frames and robust recovery from occlusion, motion blur, and illumination changes. This unified design preserves the efficiency of prompt learning while strengthening cross-modal interaction and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth, and RGB-Event benchmarks show consistent state-of-the-art results over fully fine-tuned and adapter-based baselines, together with favorable parameter efficiency and runtime. Code and models are available at https://github.com/xuboyue1999/mmtrack.git.</description>

      <title>IC-Custom: Diverse Image Customization via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production, aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However, current approaches conventionally separate image customization into position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We propose the In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism, which employs learnable task-oriented register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to effectively handle diverse tasks and distinguish between inputs in polyptych configurations. To address the data gap, we curated a 12K identity-consistent dataset with 8K real-world and 4K high-quality synthetic samples, avoiding the overly glossy, oversaturated look typical of synthetic data. IC-Custom supports various industrial applications, including try-on, image insertion, and creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves about 73\% higher human preference across identity consistency, harmony, and text alignment metrics, while training only 0.4\% of the original model parameters.

      <title>Divergence-Based Similarity Function for Multi-View Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF) that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.</description>

      <title>PSScreen: Partially Supervised Multiple Retinal Disease Screening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/boyiZheng99/PSScreen.</description>

      <title>Alternating Training-based Label Smoothing Enhances Prompt Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing (LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization. This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However, we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning. Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL, consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning. Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.</description>

      <title>Are All Marine Species Created Equal? Performance Disparities in Underwater Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO and RUOD datasets to separate the object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules. We publicly release our code and datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/CogVLA.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but remain prone to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual inputs. This issue can be attributed to two main biases: text-visual bias, the overreliance on prompts and prior outputs, and co-occurrence bias, spurious correlations between frequently paired objects. We propose Gradient-based Influence-Aware Constrained Decoding (GACD), an inference-based method, that addresses both biases without auxiliary models, and is readily applicable to existing models without finetuning. The core of our approach is bias estimation, which uses first-order Taylor gradients to understand the contribution of individual tokens-visual features and text tokens-to the current output. Based on this analysis, GACD mitigates hallucinations through two components: (1) suppressing spurious visual features correlated with the output objects, and (2) rebalancing cross-modal contributions by strengthening visual features relative to text. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GACD effectively reduces hallucinations and improves the visual grounding of MLLM outputs.</description>

      <title>Easier Painting Than Thinking: Can Text-to-Image Models Set the Stage, but Not Direct the Play?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be inferred, which thus correspond to two core capabilities: composition and reasoning. Despite recent advances of T2I models in both composition and reasoning, existing benchmarks remain limited in evaluation. They not only fail to provide comprehensive coverage across and within both capabilities, but also largely restrict evaluation to low scene density and simple one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive, inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To increase complexity, driven by the inherent real-world complexities, we curate each prompt with higher compositional density for composition and greater reasoning intensity for reasoning. To facilitate fine-grained and reliable evaluation, we also pair each evaluation prompt with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each intended element independently. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 28 current T2I models reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in high compositional scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements from prompts.</description>

      <title>Neural Collapse-Inspired Multi-Label Federated Learning under Label-Distribution Skew</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships. While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging FL scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images, achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/kzmngt/DACoN.</description>

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50, while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset for the same category.</description>

      <title>FakeChain: Exposing Shallow Cues in Multi-Step Deepfake Detection</title>

Abstract: Multi-step or hybrid deepfakes, created by sequentially applying different deepfake creation methods such as Face-Swapping, GAN-based generation, and Diffusion methods, can pose an emerging and unforseen technical challenge for detection models trained on single-step forgeries. While prior studies have mainly focused on detecting isolated single manipulation, little is known about the detection model behavior under such compositional, hybrid, and complex manipulation pipelines. In this work, we introduce \textbf{FakeChain}, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1-, 2-, and 3-Step forgeries synthesized using five state-of-the-art representative generators. Using this approach, we analyze detection performance and spectral properties across hybrid manipulation at different step, along with varying generator combinations and quality settings. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that detection performance highly depends on the final manipulation type, with F1-score dropping by up to \textbf{58.83\%} when it differs from training distribution. This clearly demonstrates that detectors rely on last-stage artifacts rather than cumulative manipulation traces, limiting generalization. Such findings highlight the need for detection models to explicitly consider manipulation history and sequences. Our results highlight the importance of benchmarks such as FakeChain, reflecting growing synthesis complexity and diversity in real-world scenarios. Our sample code is available here\footnote{https://github.com/minjihh/FakeChain}.</description>

      <title>iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning, causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end, we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical, interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular, training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning. Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for post-hoc driving video understanding.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Individual: Introducing Group Intention Forecasting with SHOT Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions, overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals, and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of 1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6 types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics: multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions. Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting. The dataset is available at https://xinyi-hu.github.io/SHOT_DATASET.</description>

      <title>CoFFT: Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought for Visual Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1) Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps; (2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of 3.1-5.8% with controllable increasing computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Explaining multimodal LLMs via intra-modal token interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality, attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC), which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.</description>

      <title>Learning Human-Perceived Fakeness in AI-Generated Videos via Multimodal LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons? While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension -- whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e., spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s. real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest). By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-TreeRPO: Breaking the Independent Trajectory Bottleneck with Structured Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT. A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification. Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This framework incorporates a novel Observation \&amp; Reasoning (O\&amp;R) reward mechanism that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks. Project Page: https://rewatch-r1.github.io</description>

      <title>Not All Tokens are Guided Equal: Improving Guidance in Visual Autoregressive Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.</description>

      <title>Proxy-GS: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting via Proxy Mesh</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering. To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles: first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training, avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset, Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>DC-Gen: Post-Training Diffusion Acceleration with Deeply Compressed Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup. Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a 4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model.

We present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA) benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple, knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes. Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better models.

      <title>Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First, we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator. Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos with desired vital signs.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer for High-resolution Land Subsidence Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT), a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.</description>

      <title>DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding, state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from 2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change? We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over 2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models. Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code and model will be released at the link below.</description>

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration. While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge, public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining, instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0 delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes medical AI.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal LLM Approach for Visual Question Answering on Multiparametric 3D Brain MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient training without image-report pretraining. To address limited image-text paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering (VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation. mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology. Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts and prompt-conditioned routing.</description>

      <title>AgenticIQA: An Agentic Framework for Adaptive and Interpretable Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions, user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner. AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection, distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.</description>

      <title>SeMoBridge: Semantic Modality Bridge for Efficient Few-Shot Adaptation of CLIP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment. This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated, making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge, a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment. Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision, combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection. Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods, particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available at https://github.com/christti98/semobridge.</description>

      <title>PRPO: Paragraph-level Policy Optimization for Vision-Language Deepfake Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level. Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation methodology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) usually struggle in learning from highly diverse data, whose underlying manifold is complex. In this work, we revisit the mathematical foundations of GANs, and theoretically reveal that the native adversarial loss for GAN training is insufficient to fix the problem of \textit{subsets with positive Lebesgue measure of the generated data manifold lying out of the real data manifold}. Instead, we find that score matching serves as a promising solution to this issue thanks to its capability of persistently pushing the generated data points towards the real data manifold. We thereby propose to improve the optimization of GANs with score matching regularity (SMaRt). Regarding the empirical evidences, we first design a toy example to show that training GANs by the aid of a ground-truth score function can help reproduce the real data distribution more accurately, and then confirm that our approach can consistently boost the synthesis performance of various state-of-the-art GANs on real-world datasets with pre-trained diffusion models acting as the approximate score function. For instance, when training Aurora on the ImageNet $64\times64$ dataset, we manage to improve FID from 8.87 to 7.11, on par with the performance of one-step consistency model.

      <title>Grounded GUI Understanding for Vision-Based Spatial Intelligent Agent: Exemplified by Extended Reality Apps</title>

Abstract: In recent years, spatial computing a.k.a. Extended Reality (XR) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering users immersive and interactive experiences across diversified virtual environments. Users can interact with XR apps through interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is instrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks, including automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE detection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object detection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually with a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and spinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in XR apps, due to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by open-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of context-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial perception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results. Thus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to XR apps. In this paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI ElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By imitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic contexts of XR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection process is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop. Specifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic context comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3) Context-sensitive interactability classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orienter is more effective than the state-of-the-art GUI element detection approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning systems deployed in real-world applications often encounter data that is different from their in-distribution (ID). A reliable model should ideally abstain from making decisions in this out-of-distribution (OOD) setting. Existing state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on feature distances, such as k-th nearest neighbors and distances to decision boundaries, either overlooking or ineffectively using in-distribution statistics. In this work, we propose a novel angle-based metric for OOD detection that is computed relative to the in-distribution structure. We demonstrate that the angles between feature representations and decision boundaries, viewed from the mean of in-distribution features, serve as an effective discriminative factor between ID and OOD data. We evaluate our method on nine ImageNet-pretrained models. Our approach achieves the lowest FPR in 5 out of 9 ImageNet models, obtains the best average FPR overall, and consistently ranking among the top 3 across all evaluated models. Furthermore, we highlight the benefits of contrastive representations by showing strong performance with ResNet SCL and CLIP architectures. Finally, we demonstrate that the scale-invariant nature of our score enables an ensemble strategy via simple score summation. Code is available at https://github.com/berkerdemirel/ORA-OOD-Detection-with-Relative-Angles.</description>

      <title>Balancing Multimodal Training Through Game-Theoretic Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning holds promise for richer information extraction by capturing dependencies across data sources. Yet, current training methods often underperform due to modality competition, a phenomenon where modalities contend for training resources leaving some underoptimized. This raises a pivotal question: how can we address training imbalances, ensure adequate optimization across all modalities, and achieve consistent performance improvements as we transition from unimodal to multimodal data? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), inspired by a mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) A game-theoretic framework that adaptively balances modality contributions by encouraging each to maximize its informative role in the final prediction 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of both task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Proposing latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and simple baseline, clearly demonstrating that training modalities jointly leads to important performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets. We release our code and models at https://github.com/kkontras/MCR.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Double-Blind Federated Adaptation of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) excel in zero-shot tasks but benefit from task-specific adaptation. However, privacy concerns prevent data sharing among multiple data owners, and proprietary restrictions prevent the learning service provider (LSP) from sharing the FM. In this work, we propose BlindFed, a framework enabling collaborative FM adaptation while protecting both parties: data owners do not access the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see sensitive task data. BlindFed relies on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and consists of three key innovations: (i) FHE-friendly architectural modifications via polynomial approximations and low-rank adapters, (ii) a two-stage split learning approach combining offline knowledge distillation and online encrypted inference for adapter training without backpropagation through the FM, and (iii) a privacy-boosting scheme using sample permutations and stochastic block sampling to mitigate model extraction attacks. Empirical results on four image classification datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the BlindFed framework, albeit at a high communication cost and large computational complexity for the LSP.</description>

      <title>DISCOVER: Data-driven Identification of Sub-activities via Clustering and Visualization for Enhanced Activity Recognition in Smart Homes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using ambient sensors has great potential for practical applications, particularly in elder care and independent living. However, deploying HAR systems in real-world settings remains challenging due to the high cost of labeled data, the need for pre-segmented sensor streams, and the lack of flexibility in activity granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce DISCOVER, a method designed to discover fine-grained human sub-activities from unlabeled sensor data without relying on pre-segmentation. DISCOVER combines unsupervised feature extraction and clustering with a user-friendly visualization tool to streamline the labeling process. DISCOVER enables domain experts to efficiently annotate only a minimal set of representative cluster centroids, reducing the annotation workload to a small number of samples (0.05% of our dataset). We demonstrate DISCOVER's effectiveness through a re-annotation exercise on widely used HAR datasets, showing that it uncovers finer-grained activities and produces more nuanced annotations than traditional coarse labels. DISCOVER represents a step toward practical, deployable HAR systems that adapt to diverse real environments.</description>

      <title>Toward a Robust R2D2 Paradigm for Radio-interferometric Imaging: Revisiting Deep Neural Network Training and Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series was recently introduced for image formation in radio interferometry. It can be understood as a learned version of CLEAN, whose minor cycles are substituted with DNNs. We revisit R2D2 on the grounds of series convergence, training methodology, and DNN architecture, improving its robustness in terms of generalizability beyond training conditions, capability to deliver high data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty. First, while still focusing on telescope-specific training, we enhance the learning process by randomizing Fourier sampling integration times, incorporating multiscan multinoise configurations, and varying imaging settings, including pixel resolution and visibility-weighting scheme. Second, we introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops when the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all available DNNs. This not only increases the reconstruction efficiency by reducing its computational cost, but also refines training by pruning out the data/image pairs for which optimal data fidelity is reached before training the next DNN. Third, we substitute R2D2's early U-Net DNN with a novel architecture (U-WDSR) combining U-Net and WDSR, which leverages wide activation, dense skip connections, weight normalization, and low-rank convolution to improve feature reuse and reconstruction precision. As previously, R2D2 was trained for monochromatic intensity imaging with the Very Large Array at fixed $512 \times 512$ image size. Simulations on a wide range of inverse problems and a case study on real data reveal that the new R2D2 model consistently outperforms its earlier version in image reconstruction quality, data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>v1: Learning to Point Visual Tokens for Multimodal Grounded Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When thinking with images, humans rarely rely on a single glance: they revisit visual information repeatedly during reasoning. However, existing models typically process images only once and thereafter generate reasoning entirely in text, lacking mechanisms to re-access or ground inference in visual representations. We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen, models progressively lose focus on relevant regions. In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence. Crucially, our pointing strategy lets the MLLM directly select image patches using their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence embedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Across various multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable baselines, establishing point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded reasoning. The model checkpoint and dataset are available at github.com/jun297/v1.</description>

      <title>MLLM-CL: Continual Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL, a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID scenarios with new model abilities. Methodologically, we propose preventing catastrophic interference through parameter isolation and an MLLM-based routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/bjzhb666/MLLM-CL.</description>

      <title>Poutine: Vision-Language-Trajectory Pre-Training and Reinforcement Learning Post-Training Enable Robust End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Poutine, a 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) tailored for end-to-end autonomous driving in long-tail driving scenarios. Poutine is trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a 72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail. Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. These results highlight the promise of scalable VLT pre-training and lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomy.</description>

      <title>ConciseHint: Boosting Efficient Reasoning via Continuous Concise Hints during Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, a critical issue is their tendency to produce excessively verbose reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting learnable hints (manually designed or learned on concise data) during the generation of the reasoning. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can effectively produce concise reasoning while maintaining the performance well. Moreover, we show that ConciseHint is flexible and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods to further push the upper bound of the efficiency.</description>

      <title>Breaking Down and Building Up: Mixture of Skill-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges for agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents. Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills (e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each handled by a specialized agent. To support targeted skill training without manual data annotation, we construct a synthetic dataset pipeline that generates diverse, linguistically natural, skill-specific instruction-trajectory pairs. We then introduce a novel training-free Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations and historical actions. SkillNav obtains competitive results on commonly used benchmarks and establishes state-of-the-art generalization to the GSA-R2R, a benchmark with novel instruction styles and unseen environments.</description>

      <title>Combating Noisy Labels via Dynamic Connection Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code will soon be publicly available.</description>

      <title>HodgeFormer: Transformers for Learnable Operators on Triangular Meshes through Data-Driven Hodge Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations, e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$, $\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition operations or complex preprocessing operations.</description>

      <title>Imagining Alternatives: Towards High-Resolution 3D Counterfactual Medical Image Generation via Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating 2D images under various conditions; however, the success of these models is largely enabled by extensive, readily available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language remains unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a step toward this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied to neurological imaging, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential. On two neurological MRI datasets, our framework simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis in 3D medical imaging. Project link - https://lesupermomo.github.io/imagining-alternatives/.</description>

      <title>Training Vision-Language Process Reward Models for Test-Time Scaling in Multimodal Reasoning: Key Insights and Lessons Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating, dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a stochastic cause-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex goals, outperforming a range of baselines.</description>
