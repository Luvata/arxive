      <title>Solving Pasur Using GPU-Accelerated Counterfactual Regret Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pasur is a fishing card game played over six rounds and is played similarly to games such as Cassino and Scopa, and Bastra. This paper introduces a CUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing efficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash equilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm for solving large imperfect-information games.
  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the large size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA tensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose the game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2) inherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by pairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This design reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and node connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a round-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and recursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach constructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$ nodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.
  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model to predict these strategies for use during gameplay. We then estimate the fair value of each deck through large-scale self-play between equilibrium strategies by simulating, for instance, 10,000 games per matchup, executed in parallel using GPU acceleration.
  Similar frameworks can be extended to other reinforcement learning algorithms where the action tree naturally decomposes into multiple rounds such as turn-based strategy games or sequential trading decisions in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Operationalizing Serendipity: Multi-Agent AI Workflows for Enhanced Materials Characterization with Theory-in-the-Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial, unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source, multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments. By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.</description>

      <title>IRL-VLA: Training an Vision-Language-Action Policy via Reward World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06571v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated potential in autonomous driving. However, two critical challenges hinder their development: (1) Existing VLA architectures are typically based on imitation learning in open-loop setup which tends to capture the recorded behaviors in the dataset, leading to suboptimal and constrained performance, (2) Close-loop training relies heavily on high-fidelity sensor simulation, where domain gaps and computational inefficiencies pose significant barriers. In this paper, we introduce IRL-VLA, a novel close-loop Reinforcement Learning via \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning reward world model with a self-built VLA approach. Our framework proceeds in a three-stage paradigm: In the first stage, we propose a VLA architecture and pretrain the VLA policy via imitation learning. In the second stage, we construct a lightweight reward world model via inverse reinforcement learning to enable efficient close-loop reward computation. To further enhance planning performance, finally, we design specialized reward world model guidence reinforcement learning via PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) to effectively balance the safety incidents, comfortable driving, and traffic efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v2 end-to-end driving benchmark, 1st runner up in CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We hope that our framework will accelerate VLA research in close-loop autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>CountQA: How Well Do MLLMs Count in the Wild?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency. Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance to foster further research.</description>

      <title>Formal Concept Analysis: a Structural Framework for Variability Extraction and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical framework for knowledge representation and discovery. It performs a hierarchical clustering over a set of objects described by attributes, resulting in conceptual structures in which objects are organized depending on the attributes they share. These conceptual structures naturally highlight commonalities and variabilities among similar objects by categorizing them into groups which are then arranged by similarity, making it particularly appropriate for variability extraction and analysis. Despite the potential of FCA, determining which of its properties can be leveraged for variability-related tasks (and how) is not always straightforward, partly due to the mathematical orientation of its foundational literature. This paper attempts to bridge part of this gap by gathering a selection of properties of the framework which are essential to variability analysis, and how they can be used to interpret diverse variability information within the resulting conceptual structures.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Cellular Trajectory Map Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular Trajectory Map-Matching (CTMM) aims to align cellular location sequences to road networks, which is a necessary preprocessing in location-based services on web platforms like Google Maps, including navigation and route optimization. Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads, limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM, which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Circuits for Knowledge Graph Completion with Reduced Rule Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rule-based methods for knowledge graph completion provide explainable results but often require a significantly large number of rules to achieve competitive performance. This can hinder explainability due to overwhelmingly large rule sets. We discover rule contexts (meaningful subsets of rules that work together) from training data and use learned probability distribution (i.e. probabilistic circuits) over these rule contexts to more rapidly achieve performance of the full rule set. Our approach achieves a 70-96% reduction in number of rules used while outperforming baseline by up to 31$\times$ when using equivalent minimal number of rules and preserves 91% of peak baseline performance even when comparing our minimal rule sets against baseline's full rule sets. We show that our framework is grounded in well-known semantics of probabilistic logic, does not require independence assumptions, and that our tractable inference procedure provides both approximate lower bounds and exact probability of a given query. The efficacy of our method is validated by empirical studies on 8 standard benchmark datasets where we show competitive performance by using only a fraction of the rules required by AnyBURL's standard inference method, the current state-of-the-art for rule-based knowledge graph completion. This work may have further implications for general probabilistic reasoning over learned sets of rules.</description>

      <title>GLIDR: Graph-Like Inductive Logic Programming with Differentiable Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques have proven effective at finding approximate rule-based solutions to link prediction and node classification problems on knowledge graphs; however, the common assumption of chain-like rule structure can hamper the performance and interpretability of existing approaches. We introduce GLIDR, a differentiable rule learning method that models the inference of logic rules with more expressive syntax than previous methods. GLIDR uses a differentiable message passing inference algorithm that generalizes previous chain-like rule learning methods to allow rules with features like branches and cycles. GLIDR has a simple and expressive rule search space which is parameterized by a limit on the maximum number of free variables that may be included in a rule. Explicit logic rules can be extracted from the weights of a GLIDR model for use with symbolic solvers. We demonstrate that GLIDR can significantly outperform existing rule learning methods on knowledge graph completion tasks and even compete with embedding methods despite the inherent disadvantage of being a structure-only prediction method. We show that rules extracted from GLIDR retain significant predictive performance, and that GLIDR is highly robust to training data noise. Finally, we demonstrate that GLIDR can be chained with deep neural networks and optimized end-to-end for rule learning on arbitrary data modalities.</description>

      <title>ParBalans: Parallel Multi-Armed Bandits-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problems often requires substantial computational resources due to their combinatorial nature. Parallelization has emerged as a critical strategy to accelerate solution times and enhance scalability to tackle large, complex instances. This paper investigates the parallelization capabilities of Balans, a recently proposed multi-armed bandits-based adaptive large neighborhood search for MIPs. While Balans's modular architecture inherently supports parallel exploration of diverse parameter configurations, this potential has not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, we introduce ParBalans, an extension that leverages both solver-level and algorithmic-level parallelism to improve performance on challenging MIP instances. Our experimental results demonstrate that ParBalans exhibits competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art commercial solver Gurobi, particularly on hard optimization benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Topology Generation of UAV Covert Communication Networks: A Graph Diffusion Approach with Incentive Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks in sensitive applications, such as urban monitoring, emergency response, and secure sensing, ensuring reliable connectivity and covert communication has become increasingly vital. However, dynamic mobility and exposure risks pose significant challenges. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a self-organizing UAV network framework combining Graph Diffusion-based Policy Optimization (GDPO) with a Stackelberg Game (SG)-based incentive mechanism. The GDPO method uses generative AI to dynamically generate sparse but well-connected topologies, enabling flexible adaptation to changing node distributions and Ground User (GU) demands. Meanwhile, the Stackelberg Game (SG)-based incentive mechanism guides self-interested UAVs to choose relay behaviors and neighbor links that support cooperation and enhance covert communication. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of model convergence, topology generation quality, and enhancement of covert communication performance.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Envelope of LLM Inference on AI-PC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the perplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using the same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these quantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp) used to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up approach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized for modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of CPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM inference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference results with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp by up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model inference. Our optimized runtime advances the state of LLM inference on AI PCs and edge devices, paving the way for efficient deployment of ultra-low-bit LLM models.</description>

      <title>A Fuzzy Logic Prompting Framework for Large Language Models in Adaptive and Uncertain Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a modular prompting framework that supports safer and more adaptive use of large language models (LLMs) across dynamic, user-centered tasks. Grounded in human learning theory, particularly the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), our method combines a natural language boundary prompt with a control schema encoded with fuzzy scaffolding logic and adaptation rules. This architecture enables LLMs to modulate behavior in response to user state without requiring fine-tuning or external orchestration. In a simulated intelligent tutoring setting, the framework improves scaffolding quality, adaptivity, and instructional alignment across multiple models, outperforming standard prompting baselines. Evaluation is conducted using rubric-based LLM graders at scale. While initially developed for education, the framework has shown promise in other interaction-heavy domains, such as procedural content generation for games. Designed for safe deployment, it provides a reusable methodology for structuring interpretable, goal-aligned LLM behavior in uncertain or evolving contexts.</description>

      <title>Natural Language-Driven Viewpoint Navigation for Volume Exploration via Semantic Block Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring volumetric data is crucial for interpreting scientific datasets. However, selecting optimal viewpoints for effective navigation can be challenging, particularly for users without extensive domain expertise or familiarity with 3D navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages natural language interaction to enhance volumetric data exploration. Our approach encodes volumetric blocks to capture and differentiate underlying structures. It further incorporates a CLIP Score mechanism, which provides semantic information to the blocks to guide navigation. The navigation is empowered by a reinforcement learning framework that leverage these semantic cues to efficiently search for and identify desired viewpoints that align with the user's intent. The selected viewpoints are evaluated using CLIP Score to ensure that they best reflect the user queries. By automating viewpoint selection, our method improves the efficiency of volumetric data navigation and enhances the interpretability of complex scientific phenomena.</description>

      <title>Remote Sensing Image Intelligent Interpretation with the Language-Centered Perspective: Principles, Methods and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mainstream paradigm of remote sensing image interpretation has long been dominated by vision-centered models, which rely on visual features for semantic understanding. However, these models face inherent limitations in handling multi-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making. While recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote sensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications, lacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of language. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to language-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a language-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs as the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action spaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We first explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in remote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges, including unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and reasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global workspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered solutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research directions from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task understanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and autonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for the next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a roadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to coordinate multiple agents to achieve a common goal. A key challenge in MARL is credit assignment, which involves assessing each agent's contribution to the shared reward. Given the diversity of tasks, agents may perform different types of coordination, with rewards attributed to diverse and often overlapping agent subsets. In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number of agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple coexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that performs explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct levels. Our method, Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), captures agent contributions at multiple levels by integrating advantage functions that reason about individual, joint, and correlated actions. Utilizing an attention-based framework, MACA identifies correlated agent relationships and constructs multi-level advantages to guide policy learning. Comprehensive experiments on challenging Starcraft v1\&amp;v2 tasks demonstrate MACA's superior performance, underscoring its efficacy in complex credit assignment scenarios.</description>

      <title>MDK12-Bench: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models on Multidisciplinary Exams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which integrate language and visual cues for problem-solving, are crucial for advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, current benchmarks for measuring the intelligence of MLLMs suffer from limited scale, narrow coverage, and unstructured knowledge, offering only static and undifferentiated evaluations. To bridge this gap, we introduce MDK12-Bench, a large-scale multidisciplinary benchmark built from real-world K-12 exams spanning six disciplines with 141K instances and 6,225 knowledge points organized in a six-layer taxonomy. Covering five question formats with difficulty and year annotations, it enables comprehensive evaluation to capture the extent to which MLLMs perform over four dimensions: 1) difficulty levels, 2) temporal (cross-year) shifts, 3) contextual shifts, and 4) knowledge-driven reasoning. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation framework that introduces unfamiliar visual, textual, and question form shifts to challenge model generalization while improving benchmark objectivity and longevity by mitigating data contamination. We further evaluate knowledge-point reference-augmented generation (KP-RAG) to examine the role of knowledge in problem-solving. Key findings reveal limitations in current MLLMs in multiple aspects and provide guidance for enhancing model robustness, interpretability, and AI-assisted education.</description>

      <title>MeteorPred: A Meteorological Multimodal Large Model and Dataset for Severe Weather Event Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely and accurate severe weather warnings are critical for disaster mitigation. However, current forecasting systems remain heavily reliant on manual expert interpretation, introducing subjectivity and significant operational burdens. With the rapid development of AI technologies, the end-to-end "AI weather station" is gradually emerging as a new trend in predicting severe weather events. Three core challenges impede the development of end-to-end AI severe weather system: (1) scarcity of severe weather event samples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data and textual warnings; (3) existing multimodal language models are unable to handle high-dimensional meteorological data and struggle to fully capture the complex dependencies across temporal sequences, vertical pressure levels, and spatial dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the first large-scale temporal multimodal dataset for severe weather events prediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and corresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios across China. On top of this dataset, we develop a meteorology multimodal large model (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data flow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable dynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical pressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench demonstrate that MMLM performs exceptionally well across multiple tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in severe weather understanding and marking a key step toward realizing automated, AI-driven weather forecasting systems. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Pushdown Reward Machines for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian) reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines (pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown automata. pdRMs can recognize and reward temporally extended behaviours representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal expected reward. We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs, and space complexity results about the proposed learning problems. Finally, we provide experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.</description>

      <title>GDBA Revisited: Unleashing the Power of Guided Local Search for Distributed Constraint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local search is an important class of incomplete algorithms for solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) but it often converges to poor local optima. While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape premature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued problems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three factors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e., over-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty accumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we propose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs that incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize constraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the magnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty updates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents play a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various standard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, compared to Damped Max-sum with high damping factors (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9), our DGLS achieves competitive performance on general-valued problems, and outperforms it by significant margins (\textbf{3.77\%--66.3\%}) on structured problems in terms of anytime results.</description>

      <title>Automated Formalization via Conceptual Retrieval-Augmented LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) require manual formalization, which is labor-intensive and demands expert knowledge. While automated formalization offers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination (e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and the semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language descriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven Retrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances LLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core mathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation. However, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is non-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic nature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal retrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a concept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical library for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions and 1,000+ core mathematical concepts. To address conceptual polymorphism, we propose contextual query augmentation with domain- and application-level signals. In addition, we design a dual-channel hybrid retrieval strategy with reranking to ensure accurate and relevant definition retrieval. Experiments on miniF2F, ProofNet, and our newly proposed AdvancedMath benchmark show that CRAMF can be seamlessly integrated into LLM-based autoformalizers, yielding consistent improvements in translation accuracy, achieving up to 62.1% and an average of 29.9% relative improvement.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Explainability of Multimodal Learning for Crop Yield Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning enables various machine learning tasks to benefit from diverse data sources, effectively mimicking the interplay of different factors in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture. While the heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops, regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties. Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations, Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks, achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation, compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying patterns across the two methods compared.[...]</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Do Not Simulate Human Psychology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06950v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs),such as ChatGPT, are increasingly used in research, ranging from simple writing assistance to complex data annotation tasks. Recently, some research has suggested that LLMs may even be able to simulate human psychology and can, hence, replace human participants in psychological studies. We caution against this approach. We provide conceptual arguments against the hypothesis that LLMs simulate human psychology. We then present empiric evidence illustrating our arguments by demonstrating that slight changes to wording that correspond to large changes in meaning lead to notable discrepancies between LLMs' and human responses, even for the recent CENTAUR model that was specifically fine-tuned on psychological responses. Additionally, different LLMs show very different responses to novel items, further illustrating their lack of reliability. We conclude that LLMs do not simulate human psychology and recommend that psychological researchers should treat LLMs as useful but fundamentally unreliable tools that need to be validated against human responses for every new application.</description>

      <title>DatasetResearch: Benchmarking Agent Systems for Demand-Driven Dataset Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has fundamentally shifted the bottleneck in AI development from computational power to data availability-with countless valuable datasets remaining hidden across specialized repositories, research appendices, and domain platforms. As reasoning capabilities and deep research methodologies continue to evolve, a critical question emerges: can AI agents transcend conventional search to systematically discover any dataset that meets specific user requirements, enabling truly autonomous demand-driven data curation? We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark evaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208 real-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks. Our tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced deep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging DatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities and perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental dichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth, while synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured generation-yet both catastrophically fail on "corner cases" outside existing distributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset discovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding any dataset in the digital universe. Our benchmark and comprehensive analysis provide the foundation for the next generation of self-improving AI systems and are publicly available at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DatasetResearch.</description>

      <title>MASteer: Multi-Agent Adaptive Steer Strategy for End-to-End LLM Trustworthiness Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face persistent and evolving trustworthiness issues, motivating developers to seek automated and flexible repair methods that enable convenient deployment across diverse scenarios. Existing repair methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) are costly and slow, while prompt engineering lacks robustness and scalability. Representation engineering, which steers model behavior by injecting targeted concept vectors during inference, offers a lightweight, training-free alternative. However, current approaches depend on manually crafted samples and fixed steering strategies, limiting automation and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MASteer, the first end-to-end framework for trustworthiness repair in LLMs based on representation engineering. MASteer integrates two core components: AutoTester, a multi-agent system that generates diverse, high-quality steer samples tailored to developer needs; and AutoRepairer, which constructs adaptive steering strategies with anchor vectors for automated, context-aware strategy selection during inference. Experiments on standard and customized trustworthiness tasks show MASteer consistently outperforms baselines, improving metrics by 15.36% on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, while maintaining general model capabilities. MASteer demonstrates strong robustness, generalization, and practical value for scalable, efficient trustworthiness repair.</description>

      <title>DSperse: A Framework for Targeted Verification in Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives. This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value. We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies suited to diverse deployment needs.</description>

      <title>Simulating Biological Intelligence: Active Inference with Experiment-Informed Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), understanding the foundation of purposeful behaviour in autonomous agents is crucial for developing safe and efficient systems. While artificial neural networks have dominated the path to AI, recent studies are exploring the potential of biologically based systems, such as networks of living biological neuronal networks. Along with promises of high power and data efficiency, these systems may also inform more explainable and biologically plausible models. In this work, we propose a framework rooted in active inference, a general theory of behaviour, to model decision-making in embodied agents. Using experiment-informed generative models, we simulate decision-making processes in a simulated game-play environment, mirroring experimental setups that use biological neurons. Our results demonstrate learning in these agents, providing insights into the role of memory-based learning and predictive planning in intelligent decision-making. This work contributes to the growing field of explainable AI by offering a biologically grounded and scalable approach to understanding purposeful behaviour in agents.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Reliable Hitting-Set Computations for the Implicit Hitting Set Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implicit hitting set (IHS) approach offers a general framework for solving computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems declaratively. IHS iterates between a decision oracle used for extracting sources of inconsistency and an optimizer for computing so-called hitting sets (HSs) over the accumulated sources of inconsistency. While the decision oracle is language-specific, the optimizers is usually instantiated through integer programming.
  We explore alternative algorithmic techniques for hitting set optimization based on different ways of employing pseudo-Boolean (PB) reasoning as well as stochastic local search. We extensively evaluate the practical feasibility of the alternatives in particular in the context of pseudo-Boolean (0-1 IP) optimization as one of the most recent instantiations of IHS. Highlighting a trade-off between efficiency and reliability, while a commercial IP solver turns out to remain the most effective way to instantiate HS computations, it can cause correctness issues due to numerical instability; in fact, we show that exact HS computations instantiated via PB reasoning can be made competitive with a numerically exact IP solver. Furthermore, the use of PB reasoning as a basis for HS computations allows for obtaining certificates for the correctness of IHS computations, generally applicable to any IHS instantiation in which reasoning in the declarative language at hand can be captured in the PB-based proof format we employ.</description>

      <title>MultiMedEdit: A Scenario-Aware Benchmark for Evaluating Knowledge Editing in Medical VQA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) provides a scalable approach for updating factual knowledge in large language models without full retraining. While previous studies have demonstrated effectiveness in general domains and medical QA tasks, little attention has been paid to KE in multimodal medical scenarios. Unlike text-only settings, medical KE demands integrating updated knowledge with visual reasoning to support safe and interpretable clinical decisions. To address this gap, we propose MultiMedEdit, the first benchmark tailored to evaluating KE in clinical multimodal tasks. Our framework spans both understanding and reasoning task types, defines a three-dimensional metric suite (reliability, generality, and locality), and supports cross-paradigm comparisons across general and domain-specific models. We conduct extensive experiments under single-editing and lifelong-editing settings. Results suggest that current methods struggle with generalization and long-tail reasoning, particularly in complex clinical workflows. We further present an efficiency analysis (e.g., edit latency, memory footprint), revealing practical trade-offs in real-world deployment across KE paradigms. Overall, MultiMedEdit not only reveals the limitations of current approaches but also provides a solid foundation for developing clinically robust knowledge editing techniques in the future.</description>

      <title>K-Dense Analyst: Towards Fully Automated Scientific Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model (GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only 18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery across the life sciences.</description>

      <title>Towards Safer AI Moderation: Evaluating LLM Moderators Through a Unified Benchmark Dataset and Advocating a Human-First Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the need for safer and more reliable moderation has never been greater. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in complexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has consistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive and personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone to errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They struggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover, their reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases, leading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore the limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive behaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49 distinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and hateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi, a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and outperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where OpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. This research also highlights the critical domains where LLM moderators consistently underperformed, pressing the need to incorporate more heterogeneous and representative data with human-in-the-loop, for better model robustness and explainability.</description>

      <title>Designing a Feedback-Driven Decision Support System for Dynamic Student Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07107v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of student performance is essential for enabling timely academic interventions. However, most machine learning models used in educational settings are static and lack the ability to adapt when new data such as post-intervention outcomes become available. To address this limitation, we propose a Feedback-Driven Decision Support System (DSS) with a closed-loop architecture that enables continuous model refinement. The system employs a LightGBM-based regressor with incremental retraining, allowing educators to input updated student performance data, which automatically triggers model updates. This adaptive mechanism enhances prediction accuracy by learning from real-world academic progress over time.
  The platform features a Flask-based web interface to support real-time interaction and integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness in predictions. Experimental results demonstrate a 10.7% reduction in RMSE after retraining, with consistent upward adjustments in predicted scores for students who received interventions. By transforming static predictive models into self-improving systems, our approach advances educational analytics toward human-centered, data-driven, and responsive artificial intelligence. The framework is designed for seamless integration into Learning Management Systems (LMS) and institutional dashboards, facilitating practical deployment in real educational environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Summarization Agents with Context-Aware Reasoning over Enterprise Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for summarizing structured enterprise data across multiple dimensions using large language model (LLM)-based agents. Traditional table-to-text models often lack the capacity to reason across hierarchical structures and context-aware deltas, which are essential in business reporting tasks. Our method introduces a multi-agent pipeline that extracts, analyzes, and summarizes multi-dimensional data using agents for slicing, variance detection, context construction, and LLM-based generation. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms traditional approaches, achieving 83\% faithfulness to underlying data, superior coverage of significant changes, and high relevance scores (4.4/5) for decision-critical insights. The improvements are especially pronounced in categories involving subtle trade-offs, such as increased revenue due to price changes amid declining unit volumes, which competing methods either overlook or address with limited specificity. We evaluate the framework on Kaggle datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in faithfulness, relevance, and insight quality over baseline table summarization approaches.</description>

      <title>EndoAgent: A Memory-Guided Reflective Agent for Intelligent Endoscopic Vision-to-Decision Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The illusion phenomenon of large language models (LLMs) is the core obstacle to their reliable deployment. This article formalizes the large language model as a probabilistic Turing machine by constructing a "computational necessity hierarchy", and for the first time proves the illusions are inevitable on diagonalization, incomputability, and information theory boundaries supported by the new "learner pump lemma". However, we propose two "escape routes": one is to model Retrieval Enhanced Generations (RAGs) as oracle machines, proving their absolute escape through "computational jumps", providing the first formal theory for the effectiveness of RAGs; The second is to formalize continuous learning as an "internalized oracle" mechanism and implement this path through a novel neural game theory framework.Finally, this article proposes a</description>

      <title>Rethinking Domain-Specific LLM Benchmark Construction: A Comprehensiveness-Compactness Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across various domains.</description>

      <title>Pentest-R1: Towards Autonomous Penetration Testing Reasoning Optimized via Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating penetration testing is crucial for enhancing cybersecurity, yet current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant limitations in this domain, including poor error handling, inefficient reasoning, and an inability to perform complex end-to-end tasks autonomously. To address these challenges, we introduce Pentest-R1, a novel framework designed to optimize LLM reasoning capabilities for this task through a two-stage reinforcement learning pipeline. We first construct a dataset of over 500 real-world, multi-step walkthroughs, which Pentest-R1 leverages for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to instill foundational attack logic. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via online RL in an interactive Capture The Flag (CTF) environment, where it learns directly from environmental feedback to develop robust error self-correction and adaptive strategies. Our extensive experiments on the Cybench and AutoPenBench benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. On AutoPenBench, Pentest-R1 achieves a 24.2\% success rate, surpassing most state-of-the-art models and ranking second only to Gemini 2.5 Flash. On Cybench, it attains a 15.0\% success rate in unguided tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for open-source LLMs and matching the performance of top proprietary models. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy of both training stages is critical to its success.</description>

      <title>Invert4TVG: A Temporal Video Grounding Framework with Inversion Tasks for Enhanced Action Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) seeks to localize video segments matching a given textual query. Current methods, while optimizing for high temporal Intersection-over-Union (IoU), often overfit to this metric, compromising semantic action understanding in the video and query, a critical factor for robust TVG. To address this, we introduce Inversion Tasks for TVG (Invert4TVG), a novel framework that enhances both localization accuracy and action understanding without additional data. Our approach leverages three inversion tasks derived from existing TVG annotations: (1) Verb Completion, predicting masked action verbs in queries from video segments; (2) Action Recognition, identifying query-described actions; and (3) Video Description, generating descriptions of video segments that explicitly embed query-relevant actions. These tasks, integrated with TVG via a reinforcement learning framework with well-designed reward functions, ensure balanced optimization of localization and semantics. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a 7.1\% improvement in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for a 3B model compared to Time-R1. By inverting TVG to derive query-related actions from segments, our approach strengthens semantic understanding, significantly raising the ceiling of localization accuracy.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Strategic Plan Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given recent breakthroughs in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more professional services are being augmented through Artificial Intelligence (AI), which once seemed impossible to automate. This paper presents a modular model for leveraging GAI in developing strategic plans for large scale government organizations and evaluates leading machine learning techniques in their application towards one of the identified modules. Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to generate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To accomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics from each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a published strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that these techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the elements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs best in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving a "medium" or "strong" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan development impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal government in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the public good. Further work will focus on the operationalization of the concept proven in this study as well as viability of the remaining modules in the proposed model for GAI-generated strategic plans.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Self-Evolving AI Agents: A New Paradigm Bridging Foundation Models and Lifelong Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components: System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents, laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and lifelong agentic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language is a ubiquitous tool that is foundational to reasoning and collaboration, ranging from everyday interactions to sophisticated problem-solving tasks. The establishment of a common language can serve as a powerful asset in ensuring clear communication and understanding amongst agents, facilitating desired coordination and strategies. In this work, we extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating them with advancements in multi-agent decision-making algorithms. We propose a systematic framework for the design of multi-agentic large language models (LLMs), focusing on key integration practices. These include advanced prompt engineering techniques, the development of effective memory architectures, multi-modal information processing, and alignment strategies through fine-tuning algorithms. We evaluate these design choices through extensive ablation studies on classic game settings with significant underlying social dilemmas and game-theoretic considerations.</description>

      <title>CP-Agent: Agentic Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code, this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or predefined workflows.</description>

      <title>Democratizing Diplomacy: A Harness for Evaluating Any Large Language Model on Full-Press Diplomacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first evaluation harness that enables any out-of-the-box, local, Large Language Models (LLMs) to play full-press Diplomacy without fine-tuning or specialized training. Previous work required frontier LLMs, or fine-tuning, due to the high complexity and information density of Diplomacy's game state. Combined with the high variance of matches, these factors made Diplomacy prohibitive for study. In this work, we used data-driven iteration to optimize a textual game state representation such that a 24B model can reliably complete matches without any fine tuning. We develop tooling to facilitate hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, and we present case studies on persuasion, aggressive playstyles, and performance across a range of models. We conduct a variety of experiments across many popular LLMs, finding the larger models perform the best, but the smaller models still play adequately. We also introduce Critical State Analysis: an experimental protocol for rapidly iterating and analyzing key moments in a game at depth. Our harness democratizes the evaluation of strategic reasoning in LLMs by eliminating the need for fine-tuning, and it provides insights into how these capabilities emerge naturally from widely used LLMs. Our code is available in the supplement and will be open sourced.</description>

      <title>MCPToolBench++: A Large Scale AI Agent Model Context Protocol MCP Tool Use Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various data sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include search, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage, etc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized method. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply context to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use abilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive datasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse formats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the difficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks with high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the success rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across different MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the number of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the textual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an LLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs' performance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale, multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is build upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories, collected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities. The datasets consist of both single-step and multi-step tool calls across different categories. We evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on this benchmark and reported the results.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Private Semantic Communication Performance: An Uncooperative Covert Communication Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel covert semantic communication framework is investigated. Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the semantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several time slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission to acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being eavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming signals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic information. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for semantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not communicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit power of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic information transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power to maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of the user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine the transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot without the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to standard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional Q network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a lower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action selection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional reinforcement learning methods.</description>

      <title>HGMF: A Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Framework for Scalable Tool Invocation within the Model Context Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invoking external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex, real-world tasks, yet selecting the correct tool from large, hierarchically-structured libraries remains a significant challenge. The limited context windows of LLMs and noise from irrelevant options often lead to low selection accuracy and high computational costs. To address this, we propose the Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Framework (HGMF), a probabilistic pruning method for scalable tool invocation. HGMF first maps the user query and all tool descriptions into a unified semantic space. The framework then operates in two stages: it clusters servers using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and filters them based on the query's likelihood. Subsequently, it applies the same GMM-based clustering and filtering to the tools associated with the selected servers. This hierarchical process produces a compact, high-relevance candidate set, simplifying the final selection task for the LLM. Experiments on a public dataset show that HGMF significantly improves tool selection accuracy while reducing inference latency, confirming the framework's scalability and effectiveness for large-scale tool libraries.</description>

      <title>ThinkTuning: Instilling Cognitive Reflections without Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have led to the emergence of thinking LLMs that exhibit self-reflective behaviors and multi-step reasoning. While RL drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025) shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements over the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

      <title>Multimodal AI Systems for Enhanced Laying Hen Welfare Assessment and Productivity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future of poultry production depends on a paradigm shift replacing subjective, labor-intensive welfare checks with data-driven, intelligent monitoring ecosystems. Traditional welfare assessments-limited by human observation and single-sensor data-cannot fully capture the complex, multidimensional nature of laying hen welfare in modern farms. Multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a breakthrough, integrating visual, acoustic, environmental, and physiological data streams to reveal deeper insights into avian welfare dynamics. This investigation highlights multimodal As transformative potential, showing that intermediate (feature-level) fusion strategies achieve the best balance between robustness and performance under real-world poultry conditions, and offer greater scalability than early or late fusion approaches. Key adoption barriers include sensor fragility in harsh farm environments, high deployment costs, inconsistent behavioral definitions, and limited cross-farm generalizability. To address these, we introduce two novel evaluation tools - the Domain Transfer Score (DTS) to measure model adaptability across diverse farm settings, and the Data Reliability Index (DRI) to assess sensor data quality under operational constraints. We also propose a modular, context-aware deployment framework designed for laying hen environments, enabling scalable and practical integration of multimodal sensing. This work lays the foundation for a transition from reactive, unimodal monitoring to proactive, precision-driven welfare systems that unite productivity with ethical, science based animal care.</description>

      <title>Breaking Down and Building Up: Mixture of Skill-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges in enabling agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents. Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills (e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Multiplex Spatial-Temporal Transition Graph Representation Learning for Socially Enhanced POI Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics.</description>

      <title>1-2-3 Check: Enhancing Contextual Privacy in LLM via Multi-Agent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage (\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.</description>

      <title>EMPATHIA: Multi-Faceted Human-AI Collaboration for Refugee Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current AI approaches to refugee integration optimize narrow objectives such as employment and fail to capture the cultural, emotional, and ethical dimensions critical for long-term success. We introduce EMPATHIA (Enriched Multimodal Pathways for Agentic Thinking in Humanitarian Immigrant Assistance), a multi-agent framework addressing the central Creative AI question: how do we preserve human dignity when machines participate in life-altering decisions? Grounded in Kegan's Constructive Developmental Theory, EMPATHIA decomposes integration into three modules: SEED (Socio-cultural Entry and Embedding Decision) for initial placement, RISE (Rapid Integration and Self-sufficiency Engine) for early independence, and THRIVE (Transcultural Harmony and Resilience through Integrated Values and Engagement) for sustained outcomes. SEED employs a selector-validator architecture with three specialized agents - emotional, cultural, and ethical - that deliberate transparently to produce interpretable recommendations. Experiments on the UN Kakuma dataset (15,026 individuals, 7,960 eligible adults 15+ per ILO/UNHCR standards) and implementation on 6,359 working-age refugees (15+) with 150+ socioeconomic variables achieved 87.4% validation convergence and explainable assessments across five host countries. EMPATHIA's weighted integration of cultural, emotional, and ethical factors balances competing value systems while supporting practitioner-AI collaboration. By augmenting rather than replacing human expertise, EMPATHIA provides a generalizable framework for AI-driven allocation tasks where multiple values must be reconciled.</description>

      <title>Ethics2vec: aligning automatic agents and human preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though intelligent agents are supposed to improve human experience (or make it more efficient), it is hard from a human perspective to grasp the ethical values which are explicitly or implicitly embedded in an agent behaviour. This is the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of designing AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This problem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations refer to \emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable) values and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a treatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh) incommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the treatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible only if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This paper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach, which has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains (ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph analysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making (or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be used to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec method is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary decision-making. Then, a vectorisation of an automatic control law (like in the case of a self-driving car) is discussed to show how the approach can be extended to automatic control settings.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Aware Transformer Training for Automated Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While transformers excel in many settings, their application in the field of automated planning is limited. Prior work like PlanGPT, a state-of-the-art decoder-only transformer, struggles with extrapolation from easy to hard planning problems. This in turn stems from problem symmetries: planning tasks can be represented with arbitrary variable names that carry no meaning beyond being identifiers. This causes a combinatorial explosion of equivalent representations that pure transformers cannot efficiently learn from. We propose a novel contrastive learning objective to make transformers symmetry-aware and thereby compensate for their lack of inductive bias. Combining this with architectural improvements, we show that transformers can be efficiently trained for either plan-generation or heuristic-prediction. Our results across multiple planning domains demonstrate that our symmetry-aware training effectively and efficiently addresses the limitations of PlanGPT.</description>

      <title>Best-Effort Policies for Robust Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the common generalization of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with sets of transition probabilities, known as robust MDPs (RMDPs). A standard goal in RMDPs is to compute a policy that maximizes the expected return under an adversarial choice of the transition probabilities. If the uncertainty in the probabilities is independent between the states, known as s-rectangularity, such optimal robust policies can be computed efficiently using robust value iteration. However, there might still be multiple optimal robust policies, which, while equivalent with respect to the worst-case, reflect different expected returns under non-adversarial choices of the transition probabilities. Hence, we propose a refined policy selection criterion for RMDPs, drawing inspiration from the notions of dominance and best-effort in game theory. Instead of seeking a policy that only maximizes the worst-case expected return, we additionally require the policy to achieve a maximal expected return under different (i.e., not fully adversarial) transition probabilities. We call such a policy an optimal robust best-effort (ORBE) policy. We prove that ORBE policies always exist, characterize their structure, and present an algorithm to compute them with a small overhead compared to standard robust value iteration. ORBE policies offer a principled tie-breaker among optimal robust policies. Numerical experiments show the feasibility of our approach.</description>

      <title>KIRETT: Knowledge-Graph-Based Smart Treatment Assistant for Intelligent Rescue Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, the need for rescue operations throughout the world has increased rapidly. Demographic changes and the resulting risk of injury or health disorders form the basis for emergency calls. In such scenarios, first responders are in a rush to reach the patient in need, provide first aid, and save lives. In these situations, they must be able to provide personalized and optimized healthcare in the shortest possible time and estimate the patients condition with the help of freshly recorded vital data in an emergency situation. However, in such a timedependent situation, first responders and medical experts cannot fully grasp their knowledge and need assistance and recommendation for further medical treatments. To achieve this, on the spot calculated, evaluated, and processed knowledge must be made available to improve treatments by first responders. The Knowledge Graph presented in this article as a central knowledge representation provides first responders with an innovative knowledge management that enables intelligent treatment recommendations with an artificial intelligence-based pre-recognition of the situation.</description>

      <title>\(X\)-evolve: Solution space evolution powered by large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While combining large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms (EAs) shows promise for solving complex optimization problems, current approaches typically evolve individual solutions, often incurring high LLM call costs. We introduce \(X\)-evolve, a paradigm-shifting method that instead evolves solution spaces \(X\) (sets of individual solutions) - subsets of the overall search space \(S\). In \(X\)-evolve, LLMs generate tunable programs wherein certain code snippets, designated as parameters, define a tunable solution space. A score-based search algorithm then efficiently explores this parametrically defined space, guided by feedback from objective function scores. This strategy enables broader and more efficient exploration, which can potentially accelerate convergence at a much lower search cost, requiring up to two orders of magnitude fewer LLM calls than prior leading methods. We demonstrate \(X\)-evolve's efficacy across three distinct hard optimization problems. For the cap set problem, we discover a larger partial admissible set, establishing a new tighter asymptotic lower bound for the cap set constant (\(C \ge 2.2203\)). In information theory, we uncover a larger independent set for the 15-vertex cycle graph (\(\mathcal{C}_{15}^{\boxtimes 5}\), size 19,946), thereby raising the known lower bound on its Shannon capacity. Furthermore, for the NP-hard online bin packing problem, we generate heuristics that consistently outperform standard strategies across established benchmarks. By evolving solution spaces, our method considerably improves search effectiveness, making it possible to tackle high-dimensional problems that were previously computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning with anticipatory reward in LSTM for Collision Avoidance of Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a collision risk anticipation method based on short-term prediction of the agents position. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, trained on past trajectories, is used to estimate the next position of each robot. This prediction allows us to define an anticipated collision risk by dynamically modulating the reward of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) agent. The approach is tested in a constrained environment, where two robots move without communication or identifiers. Despite a limited sampling frequency (1 Hz), the results show a significant decrease of the collisions number and a stability improvement. The proposed method, which is computationally inexpensive, appears particularly attractive for implementation on embedded systems.</description>

      <title>FEAT: A Multi-Agent Forensic AI System with Domain-Adapted Large Language Model for Automated Cause-of-Death Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forensic cause-of-death determination faces systemic challenges, including workforce shortages and diagnostic variability, particularly in high-volume systems like China's medicolegal infrastructure. We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic AgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death investigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's application-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a Memory &amp; Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning, hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts, with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor. By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical capacity constraints in forensic systems.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Fedspeak with Confidence: A LLM-Based Uncertainty-Aware Framework Guided by Monetary Policy Transmission Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08001v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting, algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.</description>

      <title>Fitting Description Logic Ontologies to ABox and Query Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08007v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fitting problem inspired by ontology-mediated querying: given a collection of positive and negative examples of the form $(\mathcal{A},q)$ with $\mathcal{A}$ an ABox and $q$ a Boolean query, we seek an ontology $\mathcal{O}$ that satisfies $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O} \vDash q$ for all positive examples and $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O}\not\vDash q$ for all negative examples. We consider the description logics $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$ as ontology languages and a range of query languages that includes atomic queries (AQs), conjunctive queries (CQs), and unions thereof (UCQs). For all of the resulting fitting problems, we provide effective characterizations and determine the computational complexity of deciding whether a fitting ontology exists. This problem turns out to be ${\scriptsize CO}NP$ for AQs and full CQs and $2E{\scriptsize XP}T{\scriptsize IME}$-complete for CQs and UCQs. These results hold for both $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$.</description>

      <title>AdaptFlow: Adaptive Workflow Optimization via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided modifications. Evaluated across question answering, code generation, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AdaptFlow consistently outperforms both manually crafted and automatically searched baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results with strong generalization across tasks and models. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/microsoft/DKI_LLM/tree/AdaptFlow/AdaptFlow.</description>

      <title>FNBT: Full Negation Belief Transformation for Open-World Information Fusion Based on Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence has been widely applied in the field of information fusion under uncertainty. Most existing research focuses on combining evidence within the same frame of discernment. However, in real-world scenarios, trained algorithms or data often originate from different regions or organizations, where data silos are prevalent. As a result, using different data sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to heterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an open-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief Transformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a criterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the open-world setting. Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate elements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is employed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules can be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion. Theoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which are formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential conflict elimination. Empirically, FNBT demonstrates superior performance in pattern classification tasks on real-world datasets and successfully resolves Zadeh's counterexample, thereby validating its practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>TeamMedAgents: Enhancing Medical Decision-Making of LLMs Through Structured Teamwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets, Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8 evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations, indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical decision-making domains.</description>

      <title>BlindGuard: Safeguarding LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems under Unknown Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard, an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end, we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood, and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines. The code is available at: https://github.com/MR9812/BlindGuard.</description>

      <title>From Natural Language to Solver-Ready Power System Optimization: An LLM-Assisted, Validation-in-the-Loop Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs. Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient decision-making in energy systems</description>

      <title>UPP: Unified Path Planner with Adaptive Safety and Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are surrounded by robots helping us perform complex tasks. Robots have a wide range of applications, from industrial automation to personalized assistance. However, with great technological innovation come significant challenges. One of the major challenges in robotics is path planning. Despite advancements such as graph search, sampling, and potential field methods, most path planning algorithms focus either on optimality or on safety. Very little research addresses both simultaneously. We propose a Unified Path Planner (UPP) that uses modified heuristics and a dynamic safety cost function to balance safety and optimality. The level of safety can be adjusted via tunable parameters, trading off against computational complexity. We demonstrate the planner's performance in simulations, showing how parameter variation affects results. UPP is compared with various traditional and safe-optimal planning algorithms across different scenarios. We also validate it on a TurtleBot, where the robot successfully finds safe and sub-optimal paths.</description>

      <title>AuthPrint: Fingerprinting Generative Models Against Malicious Model Providers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains, yet current deployments offer no mechanisms to verify the origin of model outputs. We address this gap by extending model fingerprinting techniques beyond the traditional collaborative setting to one where the model provider may act adversarially. To our knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate fingerprinting for provenance attribution under such a threat model. The methods rely on a trusted verifier that extracts secret fingerprints from the model's output space, unknown to the provider, and trains a model to predict and verify them. Our empirical evaluation shows that our methods achieve near-zero FPR@95%TPR for instances of GAN and diffusion models, even when tested on small modifications to the original architecture and training data. Moreover, the methods remain robust against adversarial attacks that actively modify the outputs to bypass detection. Source codes are available at https://github.com/PSMLab/authprint.</description>

      <title>Semi-automated Fact-checking in Portuguese: Corpora Enrichment using Retrieval with Claim extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated dissemination of disinformation often outpaces the capacity for manual fact-checking, highlighting the urgent need for Semi-Automated Fact-Checking (SAFC) systems. Within the Portuguese language context, there is a noted scarcity of publicly available datasets that integrate external evidence, an essential component for developing robust AFC systems, as many existing resources focus solely on classification based on intrinsic text features. This dissertation addresses this gap by developing, applying, and analyzing a methodology to enrich Portuguese news corpora (Fake.Br, COVID19.BR, MuMiN-PT) with external evidence. The approach simulates a user's verification process, employing Large Language Models (LLMs, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash) to extract the main claim from texts and search engine APIs (Google Search API, Google FactCheck Claims Search API) to retrieve relevant external documents (evidence). Additionally, a data validation and preprocessing framework, including near-duplicate detection, is introduced to enhance the quality of the base corpora.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Commodity Price Shocks Using Temporal and Semantic Fusion of Prices Signals and Agentic Generative AI Extracted Economic News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of commodity price spikes is vital for countries with limited economic buffers, where sudden increases can strain national budgets, disrupt import-reliant sectors, and undermine food and energy security. This paper introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that combines historical commodity price data with semantic signals derived from global economic news, using an agentic generative AI pipeline. The architecture integrates dual-stream Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms to fuse structured time-series inputs with semantically embedded, fact-checked news summaries collected from 1960 to 2023. The model is evaluated on a 64-year dataset comprising normalized commodity price series and temporally aligned news embeddings. Results show that the proposed approach achieves a mean AUC of 0.94 and an overall accuracy of 0.91 substantially outperforming traditional baselines such as logistic regression (AUC = 0.34), random forest (AUC = 0.57), and support vector machines (AUC = 0.47). Additional ablation studies reveal that the removal of attention or dimensionality reduction leads to moderate declines in performance, while eliminating the news component causes a steep drop in AUC to 0.46, underscoring the critical value of incorporating real-world context through unstructured text. These findings demonstrate that integrating agentic generative AI with deep learning can meaningfully improve early detection of commodity price shocks, offering a practical tool for economic planning and risk mitigation in volatile market environments while saving the very high costs of operating a full generative AI agents pipeline.</description>

      <title>Network-Specific Models for Multimodal Brain Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a network-specific approach for predicting brain responses to complex multimodal movies, leveraging the Yeo 7-network parcellation of the Schaefer atlas. Rather than treating the brain as a homogeneous system, we grouped the seven functional networks into four clusters and trained separate multi-subject, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models for each. This architecture supports cluster-specific optimization and adaptive memory modeling, allowing each model to adjust temporal dynamics and modality weighting based on the functional role of its target network. Our results demonstrate that this clustered strategy significantly enhances prediction accuracy across the 1,000 cortical regions of the Schaefer atlas. The final model achieved an eighth-place ranking in the Algonauts Project 2025 Challenge, with out-of-distribution (OOD) correlation scores nearly double those of the baseline model used in the selection phase.

      <title>Computing with Canonical Microcircuits</title>

Abstract: The human brain represents the only known example of general intelligence that naturally aligns with human values. On a mere 20-watt power budget, the brain achieves robust learning and adaptive decision-making in ways that continue to elude advanced AI systems. Inspired by the brain, we present a computational architecture based on canonical microcircuits (CMCs) - stereotyped patterns of neurons found ubiquitously throughout the cortex. We implement these circuits as neural ODEs comprising spiny stellate, inhibitory, and pyramidal neurons, forming an 8-dimensional dynamical system with biologically plausible recurrent connections. Our experiments show that even a single CMC node achieves 97.8 percent accuracy on MNIST, while hierarchical configurations - with learnable inter-regional connectivity and recurrent connections - yield improved performance on more complex image benchmarks. Notably, our approach achieves competitive results using substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep learning models. Phase space analysis revealed distinct dynamical trajectories for different input classes, highlighting interpretable, emergent behaviors observed in biological systems. These findings suggest that neuromorphic computing approaches can improve both efficiency and interpretability in artificial neural networks, offering new directions for parameter-efficient architectures grounded in the computational principles of the human brain.</description>

      <title>Understanding Human Limits in Pattern Recognition: A Computational Model of Sequential Reasoning in Rock, Paper, Scissors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do we predict others from patterns in their behavior and what are the computational constraints that limit this ability? We investigate these questions by modeling human behavior over repeated games of rock, paper, scissors from Brockbank &amp; Vul (2024). Against algorithmic opponents that varied in strategic sophistication, people readily exploit simple transition patterns (e.g., consistently playing rock after paper) but struggle to detect more complex sequential dependencies. To understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying these abilities and their limitations, we deploy Hypothetical Minds (HM), a large language model-based agent that generates and tests hypotheses about opponent strategies, as a cognitive model of this behavior (Cross et al., 2024). We show that when applied to the same experimental conditions, HM closely mirrors human performance patterns, succeeding and failing in similar ways. To better understand the source of HM's failures and whether people might face similar cognitive bottlenecks in this context, we performed a series of ablations and augmentations targeting different components of the system. When provided with natural language descriptions of the opponents' strategies, HM successfully exploited 6/7 bot opponents with win rates &gt;80% suggesting that accurate hypothesis generation is the primary cognitive bottleneck in this task. Further, by systematically manipulating the model's hypotheses through pedagogically-inspired interventions, we find that the model substantially updates its causal understanding of opponent behavior, revealing how model-based analyses can produce testable hypotheses about human cognition.</description>

      <title>Retrieval augmented generation based dynamic prompting for few-shot biomedical named entity recognition using large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is a high-utility natural language processing (NLP) task, and large language models (LLMs) show promise particularly in few-shot settings (i.e., limited training data). In this article, we address the performance challenges of LLMs for few-shot biomedical NER by investigating a dynamic prompting strategy involving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In our approach, the annotated in-context learning examples are selected based on their similarities with the input texts, and the prompt is dynamically updated for each instance during inference. We implemented and optimized static and dynamic prompt engineering techniques and evaluated them on five biomedical NER datasets. Static prompting with structured components increased average F1-scores by 12% for GPT-4, and 11% for GPT-3.5 and LLaMA 3-70B, relative to basic static prompting. Dynamic prompting further improved performance, with TF-IDF and SBERT retrieval methods yielding the best results, improving average F1-scores by 7.3% and 5.6% in 5-shot and 10-shot settings, respectively. These findings highlight the utility of contextually adaptive prompts via RAG for biomedical NER.</description>

      <title>CarbonScaling: Extending Neural Scaling Laws for Carbon Footprint in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large language models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter count, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon emissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents \textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling laws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By integrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism optimization, and carbon estimation, \textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively connects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world inefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology scaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch size scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \textit{CarbonScaling} offers key insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.</description>

      <title>PiKV: KV Cache Management System for Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models continue to scale up in both size and context length, the memory and communication cost of key-value (KV) cache storage has become a major bottleneck in multi-GPU and multi-node inference. While MoE-based architectures sparsify computation across experts, the corresponding KV caches remain dense and globally synchronized, resulting in significant overhead.
  We introduce \textbf{PiKV}, a parallel and distributed KV cache serving framework tailored for MoE architecture. PiKV leverages \textit{expert-sharded KV storage} to partition caches across GPUs, \textit{PiKV routing} to reduce token-to-KV access, and a \textit{PiKV Scheduling} to adaptively retain query-relevant entries. To further reduce memory usage, PiKV integrates \textit{PiKV Compression} modules the caching pipeline for acceleration.
  PiKV is recently publicly available as an open-source software library: \href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV}. Experiments details is recorded at: \href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV/blob/main/downstream_tasks/README.md}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV/Experimental\_Results}. We also have PiKV integrated with Nvidia kvpress for acceleration, details see \href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKVpress}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKVpress}. PiKV is still a living project, aiming to become a comprehesive KV Cache management system for MoE Architectures.</description>

      <title>A Framework Combining 3D CNN and Transformer for Video-Based Behavior Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The 3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior recognition.</description>

      <title>The Art of Breaking Words: Rethinking Multilingual Tokenizer Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While model architecture and training objectives are well-studied, tokenization, particularly in multilingual contexts, remains a relatively neglected aspect of Large Language Model (LLM) development. Existing tokenizers often exhibit high token-to-word ratios, inefficient use of context length, and slower inference. We present a systematic study that links vocabulary size, pre-tokenization rules, and training-corpus composition to both token-to-word efficiency and model quality. To ground our analysis in a linguistically diverse context, we conduct extensive experiments on Indic scripts, which present unique challenges due to their high script diversity and orthographic complexity. Drawing on the insights from these analyses, we propose a novel algorithm for data composition that balances multilingual data for tokenizer training. Our observations on pretokenization strategies significantly improve model performance, and our data composition algorithm reduces the average token-to-word ratio by approximately 6% with respect to the conventional data randomization approach. Our tokenizer achieves more than 40% improvement on average token-to-word ratio against stateof-the-art multilingual Indic models. This improvement yields measurable gains in both model performance and inference speed. This highlights tokenization alongside architecture and training objectives as a critical lever for building efficient, scalable multilingual LLMs</description>

      <title>MetAdv: A Unified and Interactive Adversarial Testing Platform for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating and ensuring the adversarial robustness of autonomous driving (AD) systems is a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper introduces MetAdv, a novel adversarial testing platform that enables realistic, dynamic, and interactive evaluation by tightly integrating virtual simulation with physical vehicle feedback. At its core, MetAdv establishes a hybrid virtual-physical sandbox, within which we design a three-layer closed-loop testing environment with dynamic adversarial test evolution. This architecture facilitates end-to-end adversarial evaluation, ranging from high-level unified adversarial generation, through mid-level simulation-based interaction, to low-level execution on physical vehicles. Additionally, MetAdv supports a broad spectrum of AD tasks, algorithmic paradigms (e.g., modular deep learning pipelines, end-to-end learning, vision-language models). It supports flexible 3D vehicle modeling and seamless transitions between simulated and physical environments, with built-in compatibility for commercial platforms such as Apollo and Tesla. A key feature of MetAdv is its human-in-the-loop capability: besides flexible environmental configuration for more customized evaluation, it enables real-time capture of physiological signals and behavioral feedback from drivers, offering new insights into human-machine trust under adversarial conditions. We believe MetAdv can offer a scalable and unified framework for adversarial assessment, paving the way for safer AD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order models are essential for motion planning and control of quadruped robots, as they simplify complex dynamics while preserving critical behaviors. This paper introduces a novel methodology for deriving such interpretable dynamic models, specifically for jumping. We capture the high-dimensional, nonlinear jumping dynamics in a low-dimensional latent space by proposing a learning architecture combining Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) with physical structural priors on the jump dynamics. Our approach demonstrates superior accuracy to the traditional actuated Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (aSLIP) model and is validated through simulation and hardware experiments across different jumping strategies.</description>

      <title>Factor Augmented Supervised Learning with Text Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate text embeddings from text data, producing vector representations that capture the semantic meaning and contextual relationships of words. However, the high dimensionality of these embeddings often impedes efficiency and drives up computational cost in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AutoEncoder-Augmented Learning with Text (AEALT), a supervised, factor-augmented framework that incorporates dimension reduction directly into pre-trained LLM workflows. First, we extract embeddings from text documents; next, we pass them through a supervised augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors. By modeling the nonlinear structure of complex embeddings, AEALT outperforms conventional deep-learning approaches that rely on raw embeddings. We validate its broad applicability with extensive experiments on classification, anomaly detection, and prediction tasks using multiple real-world public datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that AEALT yields substantial gains over both vanilla embeddings and several standard dimension reduction methods.</description>

      <title>Surformer v1: Transformer-Based Surface Classification Using Tactile and Vision Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface material recognition is a key component in robotic perception and physical interaction, particularly when leveraging both tactile and visual sensory inputs. In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers, enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently, state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering, we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications. To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface material recognition.</description>

Abstract: The integration of AI tools into programming education has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, transforming the way programming is taught and learned. This paper provides a review of the state-of-the-art AI tools available for teaching and learning programming, particularly in the context of introductory courses. It highlights the challenges on course design, learning objectives, course delivery and formative and summative assessment, as well as the misuse of such tools by the students. We discuss ways of re-designing an existing course, re-shaping assignments and pedagogy to address the current AI technologies challenges. This example can serve as a guideline for policies for institutions and teachers involved in teaching programming, aiming to maximize the benefits of AI tools while addressing the associated challenges and concerns.</description>

      <title>Efficient Safety Testing of Autonomous Vehicles via Adaptive Search over Crash-Derived Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is paramount in their development and deployment. Safety-critical scenarios pose more severe challenges, necessitating efficient testing methods to validate AVs safety. This study focuses on designing an accelerated testing algorithm for AVs in safety-critical scenarios, enabling swift recognition of their driving capabilities. First, typical logical scenarios were extracted from real-world crashes in the China In-depth Mobility Safety Study-Traffic Accident (CIMSS-TA) database, obtaining pre-crash features through reconstruction. Second, Baidu Apollo, an advanced black-box automated driving system (ADS) is integrated to control the behavior of the ego vehicle. Third, we proposed an adaptive large-variable neighborhood-simulated annealing algorithm (ALVNS-SA) to expedite the testing process. Experimental results demonstrate a significant enhancement in testing efficiency when utilizing ALVNS-SA. It achieves an 84.00% coverage of safety-critical scenarios, with crash scenario coverage of 96.83% and near-crash scenario coverage of 92.07%. Compared to genetic algorithm (GA), adaptive large neighborhood-simulated annealing algorithm (ALNS-SA), and random testing, ALVNS-SA exhibits substantially higher coverage in safety-critical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for Privacy-Aware Predictions in Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Participatory Budgeting (PB) empowers citizens to propose and vote on public investment projects. Yet, despite its democratic potential, PB initiatives often suffer from low participation rates, limiting their visibility and perceived legitimacy. In this work, we aim to strengthen PB elections in two key ways: by supporting project proposers in crafting better proposals, and by helping PB organizers manage large volumes of submissions in a transparent manner. We propose a privacy-preserving approach to predict which PB proposals are likely to be funded, using only their textual descriptions and anonymous historical voting records -- without relying on voter demographics or personally identifiable information. We evaluate the performance of GPT 4 Turbo in forecasting proposal outcomes across varying contextual scenarios, observing that the LLM's prior knowledge needs to be complemented by past voting data to obtain predictions reflecting real-world PB voting behavior. Our findings highlight the potential of AI-driven tools to support PB processes by improving transparency, planning efficiency, and civic engagement.</description>

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant promise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research has primarily examined their capacity for Socratic questioning, it often overlooks a critical dimension: adaptively guiding learners based on their cognitive states. This study shifts focus from mere question generation to the broader instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert tutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners' understanding? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded in authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through a three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states; (2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation, stimulating proper reflections. Empirical findings reveal that existing LLMs frequently fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners exhibit confusion or require redirection. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided finetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues, significantly enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from isolated content evaluation to learner-centered interaction, our work advocates a more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.</description>

      <title>Omni Geometry Representation Learning vs Large Language Models for Geospatial Entity Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development, integration, and maintenance of geospatial databases rely heavily on efficient and accurate matching procedures of Geospatial Entity Resolution (ER). While resolution of points-of-interest (POIs) has been widely addressed, resolution of entities with diverse geometries has been largely overlooked. This is partly due to the lack of a uniform technique for embedding heterogeneous geometries seamlessly into a neural network framework. Existing neural approaches simplify complex geometries to a single point, resulting in significant loss of spatial information. To address this limitation, we propose Omni, a geospatial ER model featuring an omni-geometry encoder. This encoder is capable of embedding point, line, polyline, polygon, and multi-polygon geometries, enabling the model to capture the complex geospatial intricacies of the places being compared. Furthermore, Omni leverages transformer-based pre-trained language models over individual textual attributes of place records in an Attribute Affinity mechanism. The model is rigorously tested on existing point-only datasets and a new diverse-geometry geospatial ER dataset. Omni produces up to 12% (F1) improvement over existing methods.
  Furthermore, we test the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to conduct geospatial ER, experimenting with prompting strategies and learning scenarios, comparing the results of pre-trained language model-based methods with LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs show competitive results.</description>

      <title>Graph is a Natural Regularization: Revisiting Vector Quantization for Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has recently emerged as a promising approach for learning discrete representations of graph-structured data. However, a fundamental challenge, i.e., codebook collapse, remains underexplored in the graph domain, significantly limiting the expressiveness and generalization of graph tokens.In this paper, we present the first empirical study showing that codebook collapse consistently occurs when applying VQ to graph data, even with mitigation strategies proposed in vision or language domains. To understand why graph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical analysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by redundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing optimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose RGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity as explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote token diversity. RGVQ introduces soft assignments via Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization, ensuring that all codewords receive gradient updates. In addition, RGVQ incorporates a structure-aware contrastive regularization to penalize the token co-assignments among similar node pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RGVQ substantially improves codebook utilization and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art graph VQ backbones across multiple downstream tasks, enabling more expressive and transferable graph token representations.</description>

      <title>A Federated Learning Framework for Handling Subtype Confounding and Heterogeneity in Large-Scale Neuroimaging Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems play a crucial role in analyzing neuroimaging data for neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, small-sample studies suffer from low reproducibility, while large-scale datasets introduce confounding heterogeneity due to multiple disease subtypes being labeled under a single category. To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated learning framework tailored for neuroimaging CAD systems. Our approach includes a dynamic navigation module that routes samples to the most suitable local models based on latent subtype representations, and a meta-integration module that combines predictions from heterogeneous local models into a unified diagnostic output. We evaluated our framework using a comprehensive dataset comprising fMRI data from over 1300 MDD patients and 1100 healthy controls across multiple study cohorts. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods. Specifically, our framework achieved an average accuracy of 74.06\% across all tested sites, showcasing its effectiveness in handling subtype heterogeneity and enhancing model generalizability. Ablation studies further confirmed the importance of both the dynamic navigation and meta-integration modules in improving performance. By addressing data heterogeneity and subtype confounding, our framework advances reliable and reproducible neuroimaging CAD systems, offering significant potential for personalized medicine and clinical decision-making in neurology and psychiatry.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence Extracts Structure-Function Relationships from Plants for New Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials. We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model (BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query, surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs, and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Towards Integrated Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI adoption expands across human society, the problem of aligning AI models to match human preferences remains a grand challenge. Currently, the AI alignment field is deeply divided between behavioral and representational approaches, resulting in narrowly aligned models that are more vulnerable to increasingly deceptive misalignment threats. In the face of this fragmentation, we propose an integrated vision for the future of the field. Drawing on related lessons from immunology and cybersecurity, we lay out a set of design principles for the development of Integrated Alignment frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of diverse alignment approaches through deep integration and adaptive coevolution. We highlight the importance of strategic diversity - deploying orthogonal alignment and misalignment detection approaches to avoid homogeneous pipelines that may be "doomed to success". We also recommend steps for greater unification of the AI alignment research field itself, through cross-collaboration, open model weights and shared community resources.</description>

      <title>LLM Unlearning Without an Expert Curated Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06595v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning-the ability to remove specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget sets-datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline, requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity, which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/xyzhu123/Synthetic_Textbook.</description>

      <title>Deep Ignorance: Filtering Pretraining Data Builds Tamper-Resistant Safeguards into Open-Weight LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced transparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple 6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M tokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training baselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI systems.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Intent-Driven Network Management in 6G: A Case Study on Hierarchical Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of 6G, mobile networks are becoming increasingly heterogeneous and dynamic, necessitating advanced automation for efficient management. Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) address this by translating high-level intents into optimization policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance this process by understanding complex human instructions to enable adaptive, intelligent automation. Given the rapid advancements in Generative AI (GenAI), a comprehensive survey of LLM-based IDN architectures in disaggregated Radio Access Network (RAN) environments is both timely and critical. This article provides such a survey, along with a case study on a hierarchical learning-enabled IDN architecture that integrates GenAI across three key stages: intent processing, intent validation, and intent execution. Unlike most existing approaches that apply GenAI in the form of LLMs for intent processing only, we propose a hierarchical framework that introduces GenAI across all three stages of IDN. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IDN management architecture, we present a case study based on the latest GenAI architecture named Mamba. The case study shows how the proposed GenAI-driven architecture enhances network performance through intelligent automation, surpassing the performance of the conventional IDN architectures.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Scaling Laws for Dense and Sparse Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, the size of language models has grown exponentially, as has the computational cost to train these large models. This rapid growth has motivated researchers to develop new techniques aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the training process. Despite these advancements, optimally predicting the model size or allocating optimal resources remains a challenge. Several efforts have addressed the challenge by proposing different scaling laws, but almost all of them are architecture-specific (dense or sparse). In this work we revisit existing scaling laws and propose a generalized scaling law to provide a unified framework that is applicable to both dense and sparse large language models. We evaluate and compare our proposed scaling law with existing scaling laws to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Using Multimodal Learning on Electronic Health Record</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06627v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers. Our code is available at https://github.com/MosbahAouad/EarlyPDAC-MML.</description>

      <title>CoDe-NeRF: Neural Rendering via Dynamic Coefficient Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view synthesis, but challenges remain in rendering scenes with complex specular reflections and highlights. Existing approaches may produce blurry reflections due to entanglement between lighting and material properties, or encounter optimization instability when relying on physically-based inverse rendering. In this work, we present a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient decomposition, aiming to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. Our approach decomposes complex appearance into a shared, static neural basis that encodes intrinsic material properties, and a set of dynamic coefficients generated by a Coefficient Network conditioned on view and illumination. A Dynamic Radiance Integrator then combines these components to synthesize the final radiance. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks suggest that our method can produce sharper and more realistic specular highlights compared to existing techniques. We hope that this decomposition paradigm can provide a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in neural scene representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictions and generations from large language models are increasingly being explored as an aid to computational social science and human subject research in limited data regimes. While previous technical work has explored the potential to use model-predicted labels for unlabeled data in a principled manner, there is increasing interest in using large language models to generate entirely new synthetic samples (also termed as synthetic simulations), such as in responses to surveys. However, it is not immediately clear by what means practitioners can combine such data with real data and yet produce statistically valid conclusions upon them. In this work, we introduce a new estimator based on generalized method of moments, providing a hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees to address the challenge at hand. Surprisingly, we find that interactions between the moment residuals of synthetic data and those of real data can improve estimates of the target parameter. We empirically validate the finite-sample performance of our estimator across different regression tasks in computational social science applications, demonstrating large empirical gains.</description>

      <title>Segmented Confidence Sequences and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence Segments for Anomaly Detection in Nonstationary Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As time series data become increasingly prevalent in domains such as manufacturing, IT, and infrastructure monitoring, anomaly detection must adapt to nonstationary environments where statistical properties shift over time. Traditional static thresholds are easily rendered obsolete by regime shifts, concept drift, or multi-scale changes. To address these challenges, we introduce and empirically evaluate two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks: Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence Segments (MACS). Both leverage statistical online learning and segmentation principles for local, contextually sensitive adaptation, maintaining guarantees on false alarm rates even under evolving distributions. Our experiments across Wafer Manufacturing benchmark datasets show significant F1-score improvement compared to traditional percentile and rolling quantile approaches. This work demonstrates that robust, statistically principled adaptive thresholds enable reliable, interpretable, and timely detection of diverse real-world anomalies.</description>

      <title>Fractal Language Modelling by Universal Sequence Maps (USM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: With the advent of Language Models using Transformers, popularized by ChatGPT, there is a renewed interest in exploring encoding procedures that numerically represent symbolic sequences at multiple scales and embedding dimensions. The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for mechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of individual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as neural networks.
  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively encode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of two Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that can be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM coordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer frequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and, paradoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.
  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal Sequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process. The resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing outcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity; and 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging towards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results for genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation defined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides). Nevertheless, the application to alphabet of arbitrary cardinality was found to be straightforward.</description>

      <title>In-Context Reinforcement Learning via Communicative World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle to generalize to new tasks and contexts without updating their parameters, mainly because their learned representations and policies are overfit to the specifics of their training environments. To boost agents' in-context RL (ICRL) ability, this work formulates ICRL as a two-agent emergent communication problem and introduces CORAL (Communicative Representation for Adaptive RL), a framework that learns a transferable communicative context by decoupling latent representation learning from control. In CORAL, an Information Agent (IA) is pre-trained as a world model on a diverse distribution of tasks. Its objective is not to maximize task reward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise messages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal Influence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next action. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed contextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by interpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample efficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of pre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the efficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.</description>

      <title>Do Biased Models Have Biased Thoughts?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06671v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impressive performance of language models is undeniable. However, the presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question: $\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}$? To answer our question, we conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than $0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts.</description>

      <title>MMFformer: Multimodal Fusion Transformer Network for Depression Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence, the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks, has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset. The code is made available publicly at https://github.com/rezwanh001/Large-Scale-Multimodal-Depression-Detection.</description>

      <title>Play Favorites: A Statistical Method to Measure Self-Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can serve as judges that offer rapid and reliable assessments of other LLM outputs. However, models may systematically assign overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, a phenomenon known as self-bias, which can distort evaluations of true model performance. Previous studies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or incorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating distributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly formalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated. Our method models the difference in the scoring distribution that LLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while accounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an independent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and quantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine performance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical analysis of self-bias on a large dataset (&gt;5000 prompt-completion pairs) consisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM judges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, systematically assign higher scores to their own outputs. These models also display family-bias; systematically assigning higher ratings to outputs produced by other models of the same family. Our findings highlight potential pitfalls of using LLM judges and offer practical guidance to mitigate biases when interpreting automated evaluations.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Oral History Understanding with Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oral histories are vital records of lived experience, particularly within communities affected by systemic injustice and historical erasure. Effective and efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and understanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these archives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional complexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework to automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American Incarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset, evaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in historically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert annotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We labeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic classification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For semantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%), followed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama slightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models showing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to annotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our findings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment annotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed prompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical guidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis. By bridging archival ethics with scalable NLP techniques, this work lays the groundwork for responsible use of artificial intelligence in digital humanities and preservation of collective memory.

      <title>Learning Causal Structure Distributions for Robust Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural causal models describe how the components of a robotic system interact. They provide both structural and functional information about the relationships that are present in the system. The structural information outlines the variables among which there is interaction. The functional information describes how such interactions work, via equations or learned models. In this paper we find that learning the functional relationships while accounting for the uncertainty about the structural information leads to more robust dynamics models which improves downstream planning, while using significantly lower computational resources. This in contrast with common model-learning methods that ignore the causal structure and fail to leverage the sparsity of interactions in robotic systems. We achieve this by estimating a causal structure distribution that is used to sample causal graphs that inform the latent-space representations in an encoder-multidecoder probabilistic model. We show that our model can be used to learn the dynamics of a robot, which together with a sampling-based planner can be used to perform new tasks in novel environments, provided an objective function for the new requirement is available. We validate our method using manipulators and mobile robots in both simulation and the real-world. Additionally, we validate the learned dynamics' adaptability and increased robustness to corrupted inputs and changes in the environment, which is highly desirable in challenging real-world robotics scenarios.

      <title>Analysis of Schedule-Free Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order methods underpin most large-scale learning algorithms, yet their classical convergence guarantees hinge on carefully scheduled step-sizes that depend on the total horizon $T$, which is rarely known in advance. The Schedule-Free (SF) method promises optimal performance with hyperparameters that are independent of $T$ by interpolating between Polyak--Ruppert averaging and momentum, but nonconvex analysis of SF has been limited or reliant on strong global assumptions. We introduce a robust Lyapunov framework that, under only $L$-smoothness and lower-boundedness, reduces SF analysis to a single-step descent inequality. This yields horizon-agnostic bounds in the nonconvex setting: $O(1/\log T)$ for constant step + PR averaging, $O(\log T/T)$ for a linearly growing step-size, and a continuum of $O(T^{-(1-\alpha)})$ rates for polynomial averaging. We complement these proofs with Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) experiments that numerically validate our rates and suggest that our $O(1/\log T)$ bound on the original nonconvex SF algorithm may tighten to $O(1/T)$. Our work extends SF's horizon-free guarantees to smooth nonconvex optimization and charts future directions for optimal nonconvex rates.</description>

      <title>Many-Turn Jailbreaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current jailbreaking work on large language models (LLMs) aims to elicit unsafe outputs from given prompts. However, it only focuses on single-turn jailbreaking targeting one specific query. On the contrary, the advanced LLMs are designed to handle extremely long contexts and can thus conduct multi-turn conversations. So, we propose exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, in which the jailbroken LLMs are continuously tested on more than the first-turn conversation or a single target query. This is an even more serious threat because 1) it is common for users to continue asking relevant follow-up questions to clarify certain jailbroken details, and 2) it is also possible that the initial round of jailbreaking causes the LLMs to respond to additional irrelevant questions consistently. As the first step (First draft done at June 2024) in exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, we construct a Multi-Turn Jailbreak Benchmark (MTJ-Bench) for benchmarking this setting on a series of open- and closed-source models and provide novel insights into this new safety threat. By revealing this new vulnerability, we aim to call for community efforts to build safer LLMs and pave the way for a more in-depth understanding of jailbreaking LLMs.</description>

      <title>FoundBioNet: A Foundation-Based Model for IDH Genotyping of Glioma from Multi-Parametric MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity. While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets. Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming baseline approaches (p &lt;= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized patient care.</description>

      <title>SafePLUG: Empowering Multimodal LLMs with Pixel-Level Insight and Temporal Grounding for Traffic Accident Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems. The code, dataset, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at: https://zihaosheng.github.io/SafePLUG</description>

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) are transforming industries through advanced data processing and analysis, positioning the world of DTs, Digital World, as a cornerstone of nextgeneration technologies including embodied AI. As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.</description>

Abstract: We present Zero-Direction Probing (ZDP), a theory-only framework for detecting model drift from null directions of transformer activations without task labels or output evaluations. Under assumptions A1--A6, we prove: (i) the Variance--Leak Theorem, (ii) Fisher Null-Conservation, (iii) a Rank--Leak bound for low-rank updates, and (iv) a logarithmic-regret guarantee for online null-space trackers. We derive a Spectral Null-Leakage (SNL) metric with non-asymptotic tail bounds and a concentration inequality, yielding a-priori thresholds for drift under a Gaussian null model. These results show that monitoring right/left null spaces of layer activations and their Fisher geometry provides concrete, testable guarantees on representational change.</description>

      <title>BiXSE: Improving Dense Retrieval via Probabilistic Graded Relevance Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural sentence embedding models for dense retrieval typically rely on binary relevance labels, treating query-document pairs as either relevant or irrelevant. However, real-world relevance often exists on a continuum, and recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made it feasible to scale the generation of fine-grained graded relevance labels. In this work, we propose BiXSE, a simple and effective pointwise training method that optimizes binary cross-entropy (BCE) over LLM-generated graded relevance scores. BiXSE interprets these scores as probabilistic targets, enabling granular supervision from a single labeled query-document pair per query. Unlike pairwise or listwise losses that require multiple annotated comparisons per query, BiXSE achieves strong performance with reduced annotation and compute costs by leveraging in-batch negatives. Extensive experiments across sentence embedding (MMTEB) and retrieval benchmarks (BEIR, TREC-DL) show that BiXSE consistently outperforms softmax-based contrastive learning (InfoNCE), and matches or exceeds strong pairwise ranking baselines when trained on LLM-supervised data. BiXSE offers a robust, scalable alternative for training dense retrieval models as graded relevance supervision becomes increasingly accessible.</description>

      <title>PROPS: Progressively Private Self-alignment of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alignment is a key step in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) using human feedback to ensure adherence to human values and societal norms. Dependence on human feedback raises privacy concerns about how much a labeler's preferences may reveal about their personal values, beliefs, and personality traits. Existing approaches, such as Differentially Private SGD (DP-SGD), provide rigorous privacy guarantees by privatizing gradients during fine-tuning and alignment but can provide more privacy than necessary as human preferences are tied only to labels of (prompt, response) pairs and can degrade model utility. This work focuses on LLM alignment with preference-level privacy, which preserves the privacy of preference labels provided by humans. We propose PROPS (PROgressively Private Self-alignment), a multi-stage privacy preserving alignment framework where privately aligned models in previous stages can serve as labelers for supplementing training data in the subsequent stages of alignment. We present theoretical guarantees for PROPS as well as comprehensive validation using multiple models (Pythia and GPT) and datasets (AlpacaEval, Anthropic HH-RLHF, truthy-dpo-v0.1) to demonstrate the utility of PROPS over existing methods while still providing high privacy. For the same privacy budget, alignment via PROPS can achieve up to 3x higher win-rates compared to DP-SGD, and 2.5x higher win-rates compared to Randomized Response (RR) based alignment.</description>

      <title>Mode-Aware Non-Linear Tucker Autoencoder for Tensor-based Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional data, particularly in the form of high-order tensors, presents a major challenge in self-supervised learning. While MLP-based autoencoders (AE) are commonly employed, their dependence on flattening operations exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, leading to excessively large model sizes, high computational overhead, and challenging optimization for deep structural feature capture. Although existing tensor networks alleviate computational burdens through tensor decomposition techniques, most exhibit limited capability in learning non-linear relationships. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Mode-Aware Non-linear Tucker Autoencoder (MA-NTAE). MA-NTAE generalized classical Tucker decomposition to a non-linear framework and employs a Pick-and-Unfold strategy, facilitating flexible per-mode encoding of high-order tensors via recursive unfold-encode-fold operations, effectively integrating tensor structural priors. Notably, MA-NTAE exhibits linear growth in computational complexity with tensor order and proportional growth with mode dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate MA-NTAE's performance advantages over standard AE and current tensor networks in compression and clustering tasks, which become increasingly pronounced for higher-order, higher-dimensional tensors.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in modeling graph-structured data, while Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer high energy efficiency through sparse, event-driven computation. However, existing spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD, eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs, establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph learning.</description>

      <title>LSDTs: LLM-Augmented Semantic Digital Twins for Adaptive Knowledge-Intensive Infrastructure Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06799v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) offer powerful tools for managing complex infrastructure systems, but their effectiveness is often limited by challenges in integrating unstructured knowledge. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) bring new potential to address this gap, with strong abilities in extracting and organizing diverse textual information. We therefore propose LSDTs (LLM-Augmented Semantic Digital Twins), a framework that helps LLMs extract planning knowledge from unstructured documents like environmental regulations and technical guidelines, and organize it into a formal ontology. This ontology forms a semantic layer that powers a digital twin-a virtual model of the physical system-allowing it to simulate realistic, regulation-aware planning scenarios. We evaluate LSDTs through a case study of offshore wind farm planning in Maryland, including its application during Hurricane Sandy. Results demonstrate that LSDTs support interpretable, regulation-aware layout optimization, enable high-fidelity simulation, and enhance adaptability in infrastructure planning. This work shows the potential of combining generative AI with digital twins to support complex, knowledge-driven planning tasks.</description>

      <title>Hardness-Aware Dynamic Curriculum Learning for Robust Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing modalities have recently emerged as a critical research direction in multimodal emotion recognition (MER). Conventional approaches typically address this issue through missing modality reconstruction. However, these methods fail to account for variations in reconstruction difficulty across different samples, consequently limiting the model's ability to handle hard samples effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hardness-Aware Dynamic Curriculum Learning framework, termed HARDY-MER. Our framework operates in two key stages: first, it estimates the hardness level of each sample, and second, it strategically emphasizes hard samples during training to enhance model performance on these challenging instances. Specifically, we first introduce a Multi-view Hardness Evaluation mechanism that quantifies reconstruction difficulty by considering both Direct Hardness (modality reconstruction errors) and Indirect Hardness (cross-modal mutual information). Meanwhile, we introduce a Retrieval-based Dynamic Curriculum Learning strategy that dynamically adjusts the training curriculum by retrieving samples with similar semantic information and balancing the learning focus between easy and hard instances. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HARDY-MER consistently outperforms existing methods in missing-modality scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HARDY-MER/HARDY-MER.</description>

      <title>Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning with Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline-to-online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) aims to perform online fine-tuning on an offline pre-trained policy to minimize costly online interactions. Existing work used offline datasets to generate data that conform to the online data distribution for data augmentation. However, generated data still exhibits a gap with the online data, limiting overall performance. To address this, we propose a new data augmentation approach, Classifier-Free Diffusion Generation (CFDG). Without introducing additional classifier training overhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly enhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different distributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more generated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while maintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG outperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to generate new data. Our method is versatile and can be integrated with existing offline-to-online RL algorithms. By implementing CFDG to popular methods IQL, PEX and APL, we achieve a notable 15% average improvement in empirical performance on the D4RL benchmark such as MuJoCo and AntMaze.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Machine Learning Ecosystem: 2 Million Models on Hugging Face</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many have observed that the development and deployment of generative machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models follow a distinctive pattern in which pre-trained models are adapted and fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. However, there is limited empirical work that examines the structure of these interactions. This paper analyzes 1.86 million models on Hugging Face, a leading peer production platform for model development. Our study of model family trees -- networks that connect fine-tuned models to their base or parent -- reveals sprawling fine-tuning lineages that vary widely in size and structure. Using an evolutionary biology lens to study ML models, we use model metadata and model cards to measure the genetic similarity and mutation of traits over model families. We find that models tend to exhibit a family resemblance, meaning their genetic markers and traits exhibit more overlap when they belong to the same model family. However, these similarities depart in certain ways from standard models of asexual reproduction, because mutations are fast and directed, such that two `sibling' models tend to exhibit more similarity than parent/child pairs. Further analysis of the directional drifts of these mutations reveals qualitative insights about the open machine learning ecosystem: Licenses counter-intuitively drift from restrictive, commercial licenses towards permissive or copyleft licenses, often in violation of upstream license's terms; models evolve from multi-lingual compatibility towards english-only compatibility; and model cards reduce in length and standardize by turning, more often, to templates and automatically generated text. Overall, this work takes a step toward an empirically grounded understanding of model fine-tuning and suggests that ecological models and methods can yield novel scientific insights.</description>

      <title>Who's the Evil Twin? Differential Auditing for Undesired Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting hidden behaviors in neural networks poses a significant challenge due to minimal prior knowledge and potential adversarial obfuscation. We explore this problem by framing detection as an adversarial game between two teams: the red team trains two similar models, one trained solely on benign data and the other trained on data containing hidden harmful behavior, with the performance of both being nearly indistinguishable on the benign dataset. The blue team, with limited to no information about the harmful behaviour, tries to identify the compromised model. We experiment using CNNs and try various blue team strategies, including Gaussian noise analysis, model diffing, integrated gradients, and adversarial attacks under different levels of hints provided by the red team. Results show high accuracy for adversarial-attack-based methods (100\% correct prediction, using hints), which is very promising, whilst the other techniques yield more varied performance. During our LLM-focused rounds, we find that there are not many parallel methods that we could apply from our study with CNNs. Instead, we find that effective LLM auditing methods require some hints about the undesired distribution, which can then used in standard black-box and open-weight methods to probe the models further and reveal their misalignment. We open-source our auditing games (with the model and data) and hope that our findings contribute to designing better audits.</description>

      <title>Highlight All the Phrases: Enhancing LLM Transparency through Visual Factuality Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating inaccurate or false information, often referred to as "hallucinations" or "confabulations." While several technical advancements have been made to detect hallucinated content by assessing the factuality of the model's responses, there is still limited research on how to effectively communicate this information to users. To address this gap, we conducted two scenario-based experiments with a total of 208 participants to systematically compare the effects of various design strategies for communicating factuality scores by assessing participants' ratings of trust, ease in validating response accuracy, and preference. Our findings reveal that participants preferred and trusted a design in which all phrases within a response were color-coded based on factuality scores. Participants also found it easier to validate accuracy of the response in this style compared to a baseline with no style applied. Our study offers practical design guidelines for LLM application developers and designers, aimed at calibrating user trust, aligning with user preferences, and enhancing users' ability to scrutinize LLM outputs.</description>

      <title>Towards Experience-Centered AI: A Framework for Integrating Lived Experience in Design and Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lived experiences fundamentally shape how individuals interact with AI systems, influencing perceptions of safety, trust, and usability. While prior research has focused on developing techniques to emulate human preferences, and proposed taxonomies to categorize risks (such as psychological harms and algorithmic biases), these efforts have provided limited systematic understanding of lived human experiences or actionable strategies for embedding them meaningfully into the AI development lifecycle. This work proposes a framework for meaningfully integrating lived experience into the design and evaluation of AI systems. We synthesize interdisciplinary literature across lived experience philosophy, human-centered design, and human-AI interaction, arguing that centering lived experience can lead to models that more accurately reflect the retrospective, emotional, and contextual dimensions of human cognition. Drawing from a wide body of work across psychology, education, healthcare, and social policy, we present a targeted taxonomy of lived experiences with specific applicability to AI systems. To ground our framework, we examine three application domains (i) education, (ii) healthcare, and (iii) cultural alignment, illustrating how lived experience informs user goals, system expectations, and ethical considerations in each context. We further incorporate insights from AI system operators and human-AI partnerships to highlight challenges in responsibility allocation, mental model calibration, and long-term system adaptation. We conclude with actionable recommendations for developing experience-centered AI systems that are not only technically robust but also empathetic, context-aware, and aligned with human realities. This work offers a foundation for future research that bridges technical development with the lived experiences of those impacted by AI systems.</description>

Abstract: Despite significant progress in image captioning, generating accurate and descriptive captions remains a long-standing challenge. In this study, we propose Attention-Guided Image Captioning (AGIC), which amplifies salient visual regions directly in the feature space to guide caption generation. We further introduce a hybrid decoding strategy that combines deterministic and probabilistic sampling to balance fluency and diversity. To evaluate AGIC, we conduct extensive experiments on the Flickr8k and Flickr30k datasets. The results show that AGIC matches or surpasses several state-of-the-art models while achieving faster inference. Moreover, AGIC demonstrates strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for image captioning.</description>

      <title>VSI: Visual Subtitle Integration for Keyframe Selection to enhance Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream, respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00% key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed multimodal search strategy.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Driven Plasticity in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasticity loss, a diminishing capacity to adapt as training progresses, is a critical challenge in deep reinforcement learning. We examine this issue in multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL), where higher representational flexibility is crucial for managing diverse and potentially conflicting task demands. We systematically explore how sparsification methods, particularly Gradual Magnitude Pruning (GMP) and Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), enhance plasticity and consequently improve performance in MTRL agents. We evaluate these approaches across distinct MTRL architectures (shared backbone, Mixture of Experts, Mixture of Orthogonal Experts) on standardized MTRL benchmarks, comparing against dense baselines, and a comprehensive range of alternative plasticity-inducing or regularization methods. Our results demonstrate that both GMP and SET effectively mitigate key indicators of plasticity degradation, such as neuron dormancy and representational collapse. These plasticity improvements often correlate with enhanced multi-task performance, with sparse agents frequently outperforming dense counterparts and achieving competitive results against explicit plasticity interventions. Our findings offer insights into the interplay between plasticity, network sparsity, and MTRL designs, highlighting dynamic sparsification as a robust but context-sensitive tool for developing more adaptable MTRL systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing. It remains a research hotspot due to its wide applicability across domains. Although recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved NER performance, they rely heavily on large, high-quality annotated datasets. However, building these datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing a major bottleneck for further research. Current dataset merging approaches mainly focus on strategies like manual label mapping or constructing label graphs, which lack interpretability and scalability. To address this, we propose an automatic label alignment method based on label similarity. The method combines empirical and semantic similarities, using a greedy pairwise merging strategy to unify label spaces across different datasets. Experiments are conducted in two stages: first, merging three existing NER datasets into a unified corpus with minimal impact on NER performance; second, integrating this corpus with a small-scale, self-built dataset in the financial domain. The results show that our method enables effective dataset merging and enhances NER performance in the low-resource financial domain. This study presents an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for integrating multi-source NER corpora.</description>

      <title>NS-FPN: Improving Infrared Small Target Detection and Segmentation from Noise Suppression Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) is a critical yet challenging task in defense and civilian applications, owing to the dim, shapeless appearance of targets and severe background clutter. Recent CNN-based methods have achieved promising target perception results, but they only focus on enhancing feature representation to offset the impact of noise, which results in the increased false alarms problem. In this paper, through analyzing the problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from noise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature pyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into the original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by purifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of noise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse target-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to be lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS frameworks. Extensive experiments on the public IRSTDS datasets demonstrate that our method significantly reduces false alarms and achieves superior performance on IRSTDS tasks.</description>

      <title>Maestro-EVC: Controllable Emotional Voice Conversion Guided by References and Explicit Prosody</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotional voice conversion (EVC) aims to modify the emotional style of speech while preserving its linguistic content. In practical EVC, controllability, the ability to independently control speaker identity and emotional style using distinct references, is crucial. However, existing methods often struggle to fully disentangle these attributes and lack the ability to model fine-grained emotional expressions such as temporal dynamics. We propose Maestro-EVC, a controllable EVC framework that enables independent control of content, speaker identity, and emotion by effectively disentangling each attribute from separate references. We further introduce a temporal emotion representation and an explicit prosody modeling with prosody augmentation to robustly capture and transfer the temporal dynamics of the target emotion, even under prosody-mismatched conditions. Experimental results confirm that Maestro-EVC achieves high-quality, controllable, and emotionally expressive speech synthesis.</description>

      <title>BASIC: Boosting Visual Alignment with Intrinsic Refined Embeddings in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mainstream Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve visual understanding by using a vision projector to bridge well-pretrained vision encoders and large language models (LLMs). The inherent gap between visual and textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Chinese font generation since deep learning era: A survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chinese font generation aims to create a new Chinese font library based on some reference samples. It is a topic of great concern to many font designers and typographers. Over the past years, with the rapid development of deep learning algorithms, various new techniques have achieved flourishing and thriving progress. Nevertheless, how to improve the overall quality of generated Chinese character images remains a tough issue. In this paper, we conduct a holistic survey of the recent Chinese font generation approaches based on deep learning. To be specific, we first illustrate the research background of the task. Then, we outline our literature selection and analysis methodology, and review a series of related fundamentals, including classical deep learning architectures, font representation formats, public datasets, and frequently-used evaluation metrics. After that, relying on the number of reference samples required to generate a new font, we categorize the existing methods into two major groups: many-shot font generation and few-shot font generation methods. Within each category, representative approaches are summarized, and their strengths and limitations are also discussed in detail. Finally, we conclude our paper with the challenges and future directions, with the expectation to provide some valuable illuminations for the researchers in this field.</description>

      <title>MMReID-Bench: Unleashing the Power of MLLMs for Effective and Versatile Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested person in the gallery images, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation, abnormal behavior detection, and public security. However, traditional person ReID models suffer from uni-modal capability, leading to poor generalization ability in multi-modal data, such as RGB, thermal, infrared, sketch images, textual descriptions, etc. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) shows a promising avenue for addressing this problem. Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning, instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710 multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared data. We hope MMReID-Bench can facilitate the community to develop more robust and generalizable multimodal foundation models for person ReID.</description>

      <title>CROP: Integrating Topological and Spatial Structures via Cross-View Prefixes for Molecular LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in molecular science have been propelled significantly by large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is limited when relying solely on molecular sequences, which fail to capture the complex structures of molecules. Beyond sequence representation, molecules exhibit two complementary structural views: the first focuses on the topological relationships between atoms, as exemplified by the graph view; and the second emphasizes the spatial configuration of molecules, as represented by the image view. The two types of views provide unique insights into molecular structures. To leverage these views collaboratively, we propose the CROss-view Prefixes (CROP) to enhance LLMs' molecular understanding through efficient multi-view integration. CROP possesses two advantages: (i) efficiency: by jointly resampling multiple structural views into fixed-length prefixes, it avoids excessive consumption of the LLM's limited context length and allows easy expansion to more views; (ii) effectiveness: by utilizing the LLM's self-encoded molecular sequences to guide the resampling process, it boosts the quality of the generated prefixes. Specifically, our framework features a carefully designed SMILES Guided Resampler for view resampling, and a Structural Embedding Gate for converting the resulting embeddings into LLM's prefixes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CROP in tasks including molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction and molecule property prediction.</description>

      <title>CannyEdit: Selective Canny Control and Dual-Prompt Guidance for Training-Free Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits. We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2) Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for competitor methods.</description>

      <title>CLAP: Coreference-Linked Augmentation for Passage Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based passage expansion has shown promise for enhancing first-stage retrieval, but often underperforms with dense retrievers due to semantic drift and misalignment with their pretrained semantic space. Beyond this, only a portion of a passage is typically relevant to a query, while the rest introduces noise--an issue compounded by chunking techniques that break coreference continuity. We propose Coreference-Linked Augmentation for Passage Retrieval (CLAP), a lightweight LLM-based expansion framework that segments passages into coherent chunks, resolves coreference chains, and generates localized pseudo-queries aligned with dense retriever representations. A simple fusion of global topical signals and fine-grained subtopic signals achieves robust performance across domains. CLAP yields consistent gains even as retriever strength increases, enabling dense retrievers to match or surpass second-stage rankers such as BM25 + MonoT5-3B, with up to 20.68% absolute nDCG@10 improvement. These improvements are especially notable in out-of-domain settings, where conventional LLM-based expansion methods relying on domain knowledge often falter. CLAP instead adopts a logic-centric pipeline that enables robust, domain-agnostic generalization.</description>

      <title>When Prompt Engineering Meets Software Engineering: CNL-P as Natural and Robust "APIs'' for Human-AI Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they are increasingly applied in areas like intelligent customer service, code generation, and knowledge management. Natural language (NL) prompts act as the ``APIs'' for human-LLM interaction. To improve prompt quality, best practices for prompt engineering (PE) have been developed, including writing guidelines and templates. Building on this, we propose Controlled NL for Prompt (CNL-P), which not only incorporates PE best practices but also draws on key principles from software engineering (SE). CNL-P introduces precise grammar structures and strict semantic norms, further eliminating NL's ambiguity, allowing for a declarative but structured and accurate expression of user intent. This helps LLMs better interpret and execute the prompts, leading to more consistent and higher-quality outputs. We also introduce an NL2CNL-P conversion tool based on LLMs, enabling users to write prompts in NL, which are then transformed into CNL-P format, thus lowering the learning curve of CNL-P. In particular, we develop a linting tool that checks CNL-P prompts for syntactic and semantic accuracy, applying static analysis techniques to NL for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CNL-P enhances the quality of LLM responses through the novel and organic synergy of PE and SE. We believe that CNL-P can bridge the gap between emerging PE and traditional SE, laying the foundation for a new programming paradigm centered around NL.</description>

      <title>Class Unbiasing for Generalization in Medical Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical diagnosis might fail due to bias. In this work, we identified class-feature bias, which refers to models' potential reliance on features that are strongly correlated with only a subset of classes, leading to biased performance and poor generalization on other classes. We aim to train a class-unbiased model (Cls-unbias) that mitigates both class imbalance and class-feature bias simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a class-wise inequality loss which promotes equal contributions of classification loss from positive-class and negative-class samples. We propose to optimize a class-wise group distributionally robust optimization objective-a class-weighted training objective that upweights underperforming classes-to enhance the effectiveness of the inequality loss under class imbalance. Through synthetic and real-world datasets, we empirically demonstrate that class-feature bias can negatively impact model performance. Our proposed method effectively mitigates both class-feature bias and class imbalance, thereby improving the model's generalization ability.</description>

      <title>AMFT: Aligning LLM Reasoners by Meta-Learning the Optimal Imitation-Exploration Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06944v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.

      <title>Neural Beam Field for Spatial Beam RSRP Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) is essential for beam management in dense multi-user wireless networks, yet challenging due to high measurement overhead and fast channel variations. This paper proposes Neural Beam Field (NBF), a hybrid neural-physical framework for efficient and interpretable spatial beam RSRP prediction. Central to our approach is the introduction of the Multi-path Conditional Power Profile (MCPP), which bridges site-specific multipath propagation with antenna/beam configurations via closed-form analytical modeling. We adopt a decoupled ``blackbox-whitebox" design: a Transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) learns the MCPP from sparse user measurements and positions, while a physics-inspired module analytically infers beam RSRP statistics. To improve convergence and adaptivity, we further introduce a Pretrain-and-Calibrate (PaC) strategy that leverages ray-tracing priors and on-site calibration using RSRP data. Extensive simulations results demonstrate that NBF significantly outperforms conventional table-based channel knowledge maps (CKMs) and pure blackbox DNNs in prediction accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization, while maintaining a compact model size. The proposed framework offers a scalable and physically grounded solution for intelligent beam management in next-generation dense wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Frequency: Seeing Subtle Cues Through the Lens of Spatial Decomposition for Fine-Grained Visual Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor (SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Can Multitask Learning Enhance Model Explainability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing provides satellite data in diverse types and formats. The usage of multimodal learning networks exploits this diversity to improve model performance, except that the complexity of such networks comes at the expense of their interpretability. In this study, we explore how modalities can be leveraged through multitask learning to intrinsically explain model behavior. In particular, instead of additional inputs, we use certain modalities as additional targets to be predicted along with the main task. The success of this approach relies on the rich information content of satellite data, which remains as input modalities. We show how this modeling context provides numerous benefits: (1) in case of data scarcity, the additional modalities do not need to be collected for model inference at deployment, (2) the model performance remains comparable to the multimodal baseline performance, and in some cases achieves better scores, (3) prediction errors in the main task can be explained via the model behavior in the auxiliary task(s). We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on three datasets, including segmentation, classification, and regression tasks.

      <title>WeatherDiffusion: Weather-Guided Diffusion Model for Forward and Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD). However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task. The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention (MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather scenarios.</description>

      <title>Conformal Set-based Human-AI Complementarity with Multiple Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision support systems are designed to assist human experts in classification tasks by providing conformal prediction sets derived from a pre-trained model. This human-AI collaboration has demonstrated enhanced classification performance compared to using either the model or the expert independently. In this study, we focus on the selection of instance-specific experts from a pool of multiple human experts, contrasting it with existing research that typically focuses on single-expert scenarios. We characterize the conditions under which multiple experts can benefit from the conformal sets. With the insight that only certain experts may be relevant for each instance, we explore the problem of subset selection and introduce a greedy algorithm that utilizes conformal sets to identify the subset of expert predictions that will be used in classifying an instance. This approach is shown to yield better performance compared to naive methods for human subset selection. Based on real expert predictions from the CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H datasets, our simulation study indicates that our proposed greedy algorithm achieves near-optimal subsets, resulting in improved classification performance among multiple experts.</description>

      <title>Consensus-based Decentralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Random Access Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With wireless devices increasingly forming a unified smart network for seamless, user-friendly operations, random access (RA) medium access control (MAC) design is considered a key solution for handling unpredictable data traffic from multiple terminals. However, it remains challenging to design an effective RA-based MAC protocol to minimize collisions and ensure transmission fairness across the devices. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) have been proposed to optimize RA performance, their reliance on centralized training and the significant overhead required for information collection can make real-world applications unrealistic. In this work, we adopt a fully decentralized MARL architecture, where policy learning does not rely on centralized tasks but leverages consensus-based information exchanges across devices. We design our MARL algorithm over an actor-critic (AC) network and propose exchanging only local rewards to minimize communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof of global convergence for our approach. Numerical experiments show that our proposed MARL algorithm can significantly improve RA network performance compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>Neural Channel Knowledge Map Assisted Scheduling Optimization of Active IRSs in Multi-User Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs) have potential for significant performance gains in next-generation wireless networks but face key challenges, notably severe double-pathloss and complex multi-user scheduling due to hardware constraints. Active IRSs partially address pathloss but still require efficient scheduling in cell-level multi-IRS multi-user systems, whereby the overhead/delay of channel state acquisition and the scheduling complexity both rise dramatically as the user density and channel dimensions increase. Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a novel scheduling framework based on neural Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), designing Transformer-based deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) from historical channel/throughput measurements tagged with user positions. Specifically, two cascaded networks, LPS-Net and SE-Net, are designed to predict link power statistics (LPS) and ergodic SE accurately. We further propose a low-complexity Stable Matching-Iterative Balancing (SM-IB) scheduling algorithm. Numerical evaluations verify that the proposed neural CKM significantly enhances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, while the SM-IB algorithm effectively achieves near-optimal max-min throughput with greatly reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>TurboBias: Universal ASR Context-Biasing powered by GPU-accelerated Phrase-Boosting Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07014v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing specific key phrases is an essential task for contextualized Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most existing context-biasing approaches have limitations associated with the necessity of additional model training, significantly slow down the decoding process, or constrain the choice of the ASR system type. This paper proposes a universal ASR context-biasing framework that supports all major types: CTC, Transducers, and Attention Encoder-Decoder models. The framework is based on a GPU-accelerated word boosting tree, which enables it to be used in shallow fusion mode for greedy and beam search decoding without noticeable speed degradation, even with a vast number of key phrases (up to 20K items). The obtained results showed high efficiency of the proposed method, surpassing the considered open-source context-biasing approaches in accuracy and decoding speed. Our context-biasing framework is open-sourced as a part of the NeMo toolkit.</description>

      <title>Making Effective Decisions: Machine Learning and the Ecogame in 1970</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers Ecogame, an innovative art project of 1970, whose creators believed in a positive vision of a technological future; an understanding, posited on cybernetics, of a future that could be participatory via digital means, and therefore more democratised. Using simulation and early machine learning techniques over a live network, Ecogame combined the power of visual art with cybernetic concepts of adaptation, feedback, and control to propose that behaviour had implications for the total system. It provides an historical precedent for contemporary AI-driven art about using AI in a more human-centred way.</description>

      <title>From Imitation to Optimization: A Comparative Study of Offline Learning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a 3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust, long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Medical Imaging with Large Language Models: A Study of Hallucinations Across Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However, these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT, or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Balancing Privacy and Efficiency: Music Information Retrieval via Additive Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of generative AI, ensuring the privacy of music data presents unique challenges: unlike static artworks such as images, music data is inherently temporal and multimodal, and it is sampled, transformed, and remixed at an unprecedented scale. These characteristics make its core vector embeddings, i.e, the numerical representations of the music, highly susceptible to being learned, misused, or even stolen by models without accessing the original audio files. Traditional methods like copyright licensing and digital watermarking offer limited protection for these abstract mathematical representations, thus necessitating a stronger, e.g., cryptographic, approach to safeguarding the embeddings themselves. Standard encryption schemes, such as AES, render data unintelligible for computation, making such searches impossible. While Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a plausible solution by allowing arbitrary computations on ciphertexts, its substantial performance overhead remains impractical for large-scale vector similarity searches. Given this trade-off, we propose a more practical approach using Additive Homomorphic Encryption (AHE) for vector similarity search. The primary contributions of this paper are threefold: we analyze threat models unique to music information retrieval systems; we provide a theoretical analysis and propose an efficient AHE-based solution through inner products of music embeddings to deliver privacy-preserving similarity search; and finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed approach through empirical evaluation and comparison to FHE schemes on real-world MP3 files.</description>

      <title>Whisfusion: Parallel ASR Decoding via a Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is critical for latency-sensitive applications such as real-time captioning and meeting transcription. However, truly parallel ASR decoding remains challenging due to the sequential nature of autoregressive (AR) decoders and the context limitations of non-autoregressive (NAR) methods. While modern ASR encoders can process up to 30 seconds of audio at once, AR decoders still generate tokens sequentially, creating a latency bottleneck. We propose Whisfusion, the first framework to fuse a pre-trained Whisper encoder with a text diffusion decoder. This NAR architecture resolves the AR latency bottleneck by processing the entire acoustic context in parallel at every decoding step. A lightweight cross-attention adapter trained via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges the two modalities. We also introduce a batch-parallel, multi-step decoding strategy that improves accuracy by increasing the number of candidates with minimal impact on speed. Fine-tuned solely on LibriSpeech (960h), Whisfusion achieves a lower WER than Whisper-tiny (8.3% vs. 9.7%), and offers comparable latency on short audio. For longer utterances (&gt;20s), it is up to 2.6x faster than the AR baseline, establishing a new, efficient operating point for long-form ASR. The implementation and training scripts are available at https://github.com/taeyoun811/Whisfusion.</description>

      <title>ReasonRank: Empowering Passage Ranking with Strong Reasoning Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based listwise ranking has shown superior performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement. During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive reranker \textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \textbf{Through further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance 40.6 on the BRIGHT leaderboard\footnote{https://brightbenchmark.github.io/}.} Our codes are available at https://github.com/8421BCD/ReasonRank.</description>

      <title>Membership and Memorization in LLM Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Knowledge Distillation (KD) aim to mitigate the high computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by transferring knowledge from a large ''teacher'' to a smaller ''student'' model. However, students may inherit the teacher's privacy when the teacher is trained on private data. In this work, we systematically characterize and investigate membership and memorization privacy risks inherent in six LLM KD techniques. Using instruction-tuning settings that span seven NLP tasks, together with three teacher model families (GPT-2, LLAMA-2, and OPT), and various size student models, we demonstrate that all existing LLM KD approaches carry membership and memorization privacy risks from the teacher to its students. However, the extent of privacy risks varies across different KD techniques. We systematically analyse how key LLM KD components (KD objective functions, student training data and NLP tasks) impact such privacy risks. We also demonstrate a significant disagreement between memorization and membership privacy risks of LLM KD techniques. Finally, we characterize per-block privacy risk and demonstrate that the privacy risk varies across different blocks by a large margin.</description>

Abstract: Although numerous datasets have been developed to support dialogue systems, most existing chit-chat datasets overlook the cultural nuances inherent in natural human conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SEADialogues, a culturally grounded dialogue dataset centered on Southeast Asia, a region with over 700 million people and immense cultural diversity. Our dataset features dialogues in eight languages from six Southeast Asian countries, many of which are low-resource despite having sizable speaker populations. To enhance cultural relevance and personalization, each dialogue includes persona attributes and two culturally grounded topics that reflect everyday life in the respective communities. Furthermore, we release a multi-turn dialogue dataset to advance research on culturally aware and human-centric large language models, including conversational dialogue agents.</description>

      <title>Surgical Knowledge Rewrite in Compact LLMs: An 'Unlearn-then-Learn' Strategy with ($IA^3$) for Localized Factual Modulation and Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with dynamic knowledge updates, especially when new information conflicts with deeply embedded facts. Such conflicting factual edits often lead to two critical issues: resistance to adopting the new fact and severe catastrophic forgetting of unrelated knowledge. This paper introduces and evaluates a novel "unlearn-then-learn" strategy for precise knowledge editing in LLMs, leveraging the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique, Infused Adapter by Inhibiting and Amplifying Inner Activations ($IA^3$). Crucially, this two-stage approach is powered by an initial circuit localization phase that identifies and targets the specific internal components responsible for encoding the conflicting fact. Through a rigorous experimental methodology on microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, we demonstrate that this mechanistically informed two-stage approach achieves near-perfect accuracy (98.50%) for the new, modulated fact while simultaneously effectively suppressing the original conflicting fact (96.00% forget rate). Critically, our strategy exhibits unprecedented localization (72.00% F_control accuracy), dramatically mitigating catastrophic forgetting observed in direct fine-tuning approaches (which showed as low as ~20% F_control accuracy), a direct benefit of our targeted interpretability-guided intervention. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals a nuanced mechanism of "soft forgetting," where original knowledge is suppressed from default retrieval but remains latent and conditionally accessible, enhancing model safety and control. These findings represent a significant advancement towards precise, localized, and safe knowledge management in compact LLMs.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for Crowd Navigation via Learning-Based Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe navigation in pedestrian-rich environments remains a key challenge for autonomous robots. This work evaluates the integration of a deep learning-based Social-Implicit (SI) pedestrian trajectory predictor within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework on the physical Continental Corriere robot. Tested across varied pedestrian densities, the SI-MPC system is compared to a traditional Constant Velocity (CV) model in both open-loop prediction and closed-loop navigation. Results show that SI improves trajectory prediction - reducing errors by up to 76% in low-density settings - and enhances safety and motion smoothness in crowded scenes. Moreover, real-world deployment reveals discrepancies between open-loop metrics and closed-loop performance, as the SI model yields broader, more cautious predictions. These findings emphasize the importance of system-level evaluation and highlight the SI-MPC framework's promise for safer, more adaptive navigation in dynamic, human-populated environments.</description>

      <title>An Evolutionary Game-Theoretic Merging Decision-Making Considering Social Acceptance for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging is of great challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs), since they have to proactively interact with surrounding vehicles to enter the main road safely within limited time. However, existing decision-making algorithms fail to adequately address dynamic complexities and social acceptance of AVs, leading to suboptimal or unsafe merging decisions. To address this, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic (EGT) merging decision-making framework, grounded in the bounded rationality of human drivers, which dynamically balances the benefits of both AVs and main-road vehicles (MVs). We formulate the cut-in decision-making process as an EGT problem with a multi-objective payoff function that reflects human-like driving preferences. By solving the replicator dynamic equation for the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), the optimal cut-in timing is derived, balancing efficiency, comfort, and safety for both AVs and MVs. A real-time driving style estimation algorithm is proposed to adjust the game payoff function online by observing the immediate reactions of MVs. Empirical results demonstrate that we improve the efficiency, comfort and safety of both AVs and MVs compared with existing game-theoretic and traditional planning approaches across multi-object metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SQL-Exchange, a framework for mapping SQL queries across different database schemas by preserving the source query structure while adapting domain-specific elements to align with the target schema. We investigate the conditions under which such mappings are feasible and beneficial, and examine their impact on enhancing the in-context learning performance of text-to-SQL systems as a downstream task. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple model families and benchmark datasets--assessing structural alignment with source queries, execution validity on target databases, and semantic correctness--demonstrates that SQL-Exchange is effective across a wide range of schemas and query types. Our results further show that using mapped queries as in-context examples consistently improves text-to-SQL performance over using queries from the source schema.</description>

      <title>Hide or Highlight: Understanding the Impact of Factuality Expression on User Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are known to produce outputs that are plausible but factually incorrect. To prevent people from making erroneous decisions by blindly trusting AI, researchers have explored various ways of communicating factuality estimates in AI-generated outputs to end-users. However, little is known about whether revealing content estimated to be factually incorrect influences users' trust when compared to hiding it altogether. We tested four different ways of disclosing an AI-generated output with factuality assessments: transparent (highlights less factual content), attention (highlights factual content), opaque (removes less factual content), ambiguity (makes less factual content vague), and compared them with a baseline response without factuality information. We conducted a human subjects research (N = 148) using the strategies in question-answering scenarios. We found that the opaque and ambiguity strategies led to higher trust while maintaining perceived answer quality, compared to the other strategies. We discuss the efficacy of hiding presumably less factual content to build end-user trust.</description>

      <title>Less Is More: Training-Free Sparse Attention with Global Locality for Efficient Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance through test-time scaling but incur substantial computational overhead, particularly from excessive token generation when processing short input prompts. While sparse attention mechanisms can reduce latency and memory usage, existing approaches suffer from significant accuracy degradation due to accumulated errors during long-generation reasoning. These methods generally require either high token retention rates or expensive retraining. We introduce LessIsMore, a training-free sparse attention mechanism for reasoning tasks, which leverages global attention patterns rather than relying on traditional head-specific local optimizations. LessIsMore aggregates token selections from local attention heads with recent contextual information, enabling unified cross-head token ranking for future decoding layers. This unified selection improves generalization and efficiency by avoiding the need to maintain separate token subsets per head. Evaluation across diverse reasoning tasks and benchmarks shows that LessIsMore preserves -- and in some cases improves -- accuracy while achieving a $1.1\times$ average decoding speed-up compared to full attention. Moreover, LessIsMore attends to $2\times$ fewer tokens without accuracy loss, achieving a $1.13\times$ end-to-end speed-up compared to existing sparse attention methods.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Order Mean Flow Generative Models: Feasibility, Expressivity, and Provably Efficient Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative modelling has seen significant advances through simulation-free paradigms such as Flow Matching, and in particular, the MeanFlow framework, which replaces instantaneous velocity fields with average velocities to enable efficient single-step sampling. In this work, we introduce a theoretical study on Second-Order MeanFlow, a novel extension that incorporates average acceleration fields into the MeanFlow objective. We first establish the feasibility of our approach by proving that the average acceleration satisfies a generalized consistency condition analogous to first-order MeanFlow, thereby supporting stable, one-step sampling and tractable loss functions. We then characterize its expressivity via circuit complexity analysis, showing that under mild assumptions, the Second-Order MeanFlow sampling process can be implemented by uniform threshold circuits within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ class. Finally, we derive provably efficient criteria for scalable implementation by leveraging fast approximate attention computations: we prove that attention operations within the Second-Order MeanFlow architecture can be approximated to within $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. Together, these results lay the theoretical foundation for high-order flow matching models that combine rich dynamics with practical sampling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Investigating Intersectional Bias in Large Language Models using Confidence Disparities in Coreference Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance, leading to their widespread adoption as decision-support tools in resource-constrained contexts like hiring and admissions. There is, however, scientific consensus that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10 attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns. Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called Coreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly, coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers, indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social harm.</description>

      <title>Pref-GUIDE: Continual Policy Learning from Real-Time Human Feedback via Preference-Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training reinforcement learning agents with human feedback is crucial when task objectives are difficult to specify through dense reward functions. While prior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human preferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents must adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time scalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued learning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is often noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of learned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time scalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for continual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal inconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering ambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by aggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus preferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly outperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even expert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured preferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and principled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Evaluation of GANs and Diffusion Models for Generating X-rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative image models have achieved remarkable progress in both natural and medical imaging. In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However, questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities: Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets for AI diagnostic systems.</description>

      <title>Toward AI Matching Policies in Homeless Services: A Qualitative Study with Policymakers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence researchers have proposed various data-driven algorithms to improve the processes that match individuals experiencing homelessness to scarce housing resources. It remains unclear whether and how these algorithms are received or adopted by practitioners and what their corresponding consequences are. Through semi-structured interviews with 13 policymakers in homeless services in Los Angeles, we investigate whether such change-makers are open to the idea of integrating AI into the housing resource matching process, identifying where they see potential gains and drawbacks from such a system in issues of efficiency, fairness, and transparency. Our qualitative analysis indicates that, even when aware of various complicating factors, policymakers welcome the idea of an AI matching tool if thoughtfully designed and used in tandem with human decision-makers. Though there is no consensus as to the exact design of such an AI system, insights from policymakers raise open questions and design considerations that can be enlightening for future researchers and practitioners who aim to build responsible algorithmic systems to support decision-making in low-resource scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on 230 visualisations, this paper examines the depiction of museum curators by the popular generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) model, ChatGPT4o. While the AI-generated representations do not reiterate popular stereotypes of curators as nerdy, conservative in dress and stuck in time rummaging through collections, they contrast sharply with real-world demographics. AI-generated imagery extremely underrepresents women (3.5% vs 49% to 72% in reality) and disregards ethnic communities other than Caucasian (0% vs 18% to 36%). It only over-represents young curators (79% vs approx. 27%) but also renders curators to resemble yuppie professionals or people featuring in fashion advertising. Stereotypical attributes are prevalent, with curators widely depicted as wearing beards and holding clipboards or digital tablets. The findings highlight biases in the generative AI image creation dataset, which is poised to shape an inaccurate portrayal of museum professionals if the images were to be taken uncritically at face value.</description>

      <title>A Stable and Principled Loss Function for Direct Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is commonly achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplified this paradigm by establishing a direct mapping between the optimal policy and a reward function, eliminating the need for an explicit reward model. However, we argue that the DPO loss function is theoretically misaligned with its own derivation, as it promotes the indefinite maximization of a logits difference, which can lead to training instability and reward hacking. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function derived directly from the RLHF optimality condition. Our proposed loss targets a specific, finite value for the logits difference, which is dictated by the underlying reward, rather than its maximization. We provide a theoretical analysis, including a gradient-based comparison, to demonstrate that our method avoids the large gradients that plague DPO when the probability of dispreferred responses approaches zero. This inherent stability prevents reward hacking and leads to more effective alignment. We validate our approach by fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-7B model, showing significant win-rate improvements over a standard DPO baseline and achieving competitive performance against larger models like Llama-3.1-8B.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring LLM alignment is critical to information security as AI models become increasingly widespread and integrated in society. Unfortunately, many defenses against adversarial attacks and jailbreaking on LLMs cannot adapt quickly to new attacks, degrade model responses to benign prompts, or introduce significant barriers to scalable implementation. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a real-time, self-tuning (RTST) moderator framework to defend against adversarial attacks while maintaining a lightweight training footprint. We empirically evaluate its effectiveness using Google's Gemini models against modern, effective jailbreaks. Our results demonstrate the advantages of an adaptive, minimally intrusive framework for jailbreak defense over traditional fine-tuning or classifier models.</description>

      <title>SGD Convergence under Stepsize Shrinkage in Low-Precision Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-precision training has become essential for reducing the computational and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantization of gradients introduces both magnitude shrinkage and additive noise, which can alter the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this work, we study the convergence of SGD under a gradient shrinkage model, where each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor $q_k \in (0,1]$ and perturbed by zero-mean quantization noise. We show that this shrinkage is equivalent to replacing the nominal stepsize $\mu_k$ with an effective stepsize $\mu_k q_k$, which slows convergence when $q_{\min} &lt; 1$. Under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges, but at a reduced rate determined by $q_{\min}$, and with an increased asymptotic error floor due to quantization noise. We theoretically analyze how reduced numerical precision slows down training by modeling it as gradient shrinkage in the standard SGD convergence framework.</description>

      <title>Fairness of Automatic Speech Recognition: Looking Through a Philosophical Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems now mediate countless human-technology interactions, yet research on their fairness implications remains surprisingly limited. This paper examines ASR bias through a philosophical lens, arguing that systematic misrecognition of certain speech varieties constitutes more than a technical limitation -- it represents a form of disrespect that compounds historical injustices against marginalized linguistic communities. We distinguish between morally neutral classification (discriminate1) and harmful discrimination (discriminate2), demonstrating how ASR systems can inadvertently transform the former into the latter when they consistently misrecognize non-standard dialects. We identify three unique ethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from other algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of non-standard varieties ("temporal taxation"), the disruption of conversational flow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between speech patterns and personal/cultural identity. These factors create asymmetric power relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture. The paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism in ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce problematic language ideologies. We conclude that addressing ASR bias requires more than technical interventions; it demands recognition of diverse speech varieties as legitimate forms of expression worthy of technological accommodation. This philosophical reframing offers new pathways for developing ASR systems that respect linguistic diversity and speaker autonomy.</description>

      <title>Intention-Aware Diffusion Model for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions. Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI combines neural network adaptability with symbolic reasoning, promising an approach to address the complex regulatory, operational, and safety challenges in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). This survey reviews its applications across key AAM domains such as demand forecasting, aircraft design, and real-time air traffic management. Our analysis reveals a fragmented research landscape where methodologies, including Neurosymbolic Reinforcement Learning, have shown potential for dynamic optimization but still face hurdles in scalability, robustness, and compliance with aviation standards. We classify current advancements, present relevant case studies, and outline future research directions aimed at integrating these approaches into reliable, transparent AAM systems. By linking advanced AI techniques with AAM's operational demands, this work provides a concise roadmap for researchers and practitioners developing next-generation air mobility solutions.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Multi-sequence Pretraining for Generalizable MRI Analysis in Versatile Clinical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types. Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study, we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures, with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks, including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis, thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Multi-Scale Feature Extraction with Fully Connected LMF Layer for Salient Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of computer vision, multi-scale feature extraction is vital for tasks such as salient object detection. However, achieving this capability in lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks.

      <title>Improved Personalized Headline Generation via Denoising Fake Interests from Implicit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate personalized headline generation hinges on precisely capturing user interests from historical behaviors. However, existing methods neglect personalized-irrelevant click noise in entire historical clickstreams, which may lead to hallucinated headlines that deviate from genuine user preferences. In this paper, we reveal the detrimental impact of click noise on personalized generation quality through rigorous analysis in both user and news dimensions. Based on these insights, we propose a novel Personalized Headline Generation framework via Denoising Fake Interests from Implicit Feedback (PHG-DIF). PHG-DIF first employs dual-stage filtering to effectively remove clickstream noise, identified by short dwell times and abnormal click bursts, and then leverages multi-level temporal fusion to dynamically model users' evolving and multi-faceted interests for precise profiling. Moreover, we release DT-PENS, a new benchmark dataset comprising the click behavior of 1,000 carefully curated users and nearly 10,000 annotated personalized headlines with historical dwell time annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHG-DIF substantially mitigates the adverse effects of click noise and significantly improves headline quality, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on DT-PENS. Our framework implementation and dataset are available at https://github.com/liukejin-up/PHG-DIF.</description>

      <title>Schema Lineage Extraction at Scale: Multilingual Pipelines, Composite Evaluation, and Language-Model Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enterprise data pipelines, characterized by complex transformations across multiple programming languages, often cause a semantic disconnect between original metadata and downstream data. This "semantic drift" compromises data reproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this, a novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method identifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation logic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of data transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this paper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that assesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is also presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world industrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from 1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema lineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting techniques. Specially, a 32B open-source model, using a single reasoning trace, can achieve performance comparable to the GPT series under standard prompting. This finding suggests a scalable and economical approach for deploying schema-aware agents in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Benchmark Construction for Evaluating Large Language Models on Real-World Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software development workflows, rigorously evaluating their performance on complex, real-world code generation tasks has become essential. However, existing benchmarks often suffer from data contamination and limited test rigor, constraining their ability to reveal model failures effectively. To address these, we present CODE2BENCH, a end-to-end pipeline for dynamically constructing robust and contamination-resistant benchmarks from real-world GitHub repositories. Specifically, CODE2BENCH introduces three key innovations: (1) Automated Dynamism, achieved through periodic ingestion of recent code to minimize training data contamination; (2) Scope Graph-based dependency analysis, which enables structured classification of functions into benchmark instances with controlled dependency levels (distinguishing between Self-Contained (SC) tasks for cross-language evaluation and Weakly Self-Contained (WSC) tasks involving permitted library usage); and (3) Property-Based Testing (PBT) for the automated synthesis of rigorous test suites to enable thorough functional verification. Using this pipeline, we construct CODE2BENCH-2505, the first benchmark derived from 880 recent Python projects spanning diverse domains, comprising 1,163 code generation tasks with 100% average branch coverage on ground-truth implementations. Extensive evaluation of 16 LLMs using CODE2BENCH-2505 reveals that models consistently struggle with SC tasks requiring complex, non-standard logic and cross-language transfer, while showing relatively stronger performance on WSC tasks in Python. Our work introduces a contamination-resistant, language-agnostic methodology for dynamic benchmark construction, offering a principled foundation for the comprehensive and realistic evaluation of LLMs on real-world software development tasks.</description>

      <title>Explainability-in-Action: Enabling Expressive Manipulation and Tacit Understanding by Bending Diffusion Models in ComfyUI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) in creative contexts can go beyond transparency to support artistic engagement, modifiability, and sustained practice. While curated datasets and training human-scale models can offer artists greater agency and control, large-scale generative models like text-to-image diffusion systems often obscure these possibilities. We suggest that even large models can be treated as creative materials if their internal structure is exposed and manipulable. We propose a craft-based approach to explainability rooted in long-term, hands-on engagement akin to Sch\"on's "reflection-in-action" and demonstrate its application through a model-bending and inspection plugin integrated into the node-based interface of ComfyUI. We demonstrate that by interactively manipulating different parts of a generative model, artists can develop an intuition about how each component influences the output.</description>

      <title>DySK-Attn: A Framework for Efficient, Real-Time Knowledge Updating in Large Language Models via Dynamic Sparse Knowledge Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a critical limitation: their knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated. Retraining these massive models is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing techniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address this, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach synergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated instantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention mechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search, efficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of facts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of dense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from irrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on time-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly outperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated knowledge and computational efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and effective solution for building LLMs that can stay current with the ever-changing world.</description>

      <title>Adapting LLMs to Time Series Forecasting via Temporal Heterogeneity Modeling and Semantic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing due to their strong generalization and sequence modeling capabilities. However, their direct application to time series forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the inherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between continuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this work, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment. Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling localized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal features with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of time series into language-based models while eliminating the need for handcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all datasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\% over recent state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of incorporating both pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs when adapting LLMs for time series forecasting. The code is available at: https://github.com/syrGitHub/TALON.</description>

      <title>Can Smaller Large Language Models Evaluate Research Quality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although both Google Gemini (1.5 Flash) and ChatGPT (4o and 4o-mini) give research quality evaluation scores that correlate positively with expert scores in nearly all fields, and more strongly that citations in most, it is not known whether this is true for smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). In response, this article assesses Google's Gemma-3-27b-it, a downloadable LLM (60Gb). The results for 104,187 articles show that Gemma-3-27b-it scores correlate positively with an expert research quality score proxy for all 34 Units of Assessment (broad fields) from the UK Research Excellence Framework 2021. The Gemma-3-27b-it correlations have 83.8% of the strength of ChatGPT 4o and 94.7% of the strength of ChatGPT 4o-mini correlations. Differently from the two larger LLMs, the Gemma-3-27b-it correlations do not increase substantially when the scores are averaged across five repetitions, its scores tend to be lower, and its reports are relatively uniform in style. Overall, the results show that research quality score estimation can be conducted by offline LLMs, so this capability is not an emergent property of the largest LLMs. Moreover, score improvement through repetition is not a universal feature of LLMs. In conclusion, although the largest LLMs still have the highest research evaluation score estimation capability, smaller ones can also be used for this task, and this can be helpful for cost saving or when secure offline processing is needed.</description>

      <title>Propagation Tree Is Not Deep: Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning Approach for Rumor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rumor detection on social media has become increasingly important. Most existing graph-based models presume rumor propagation trees (RPTs) have deep structures and learn sequential stance features along branches. However, through statistical analysis on real-world datasets, we find RPTs exhibit wide structures, with most nodes being shallow 1-level replies. To focus learning on intensive substructures, we propose Rumor Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning (RAGCL) method with adaptive view augmentation guided by node centralities. We summarize three principles for RPT augmentation: 1) exempt root nodes, 2) retain deep reply nodes, 3) preserve lower-level nodes in deep sections. We employ node dropping, attribute masking and edge dropping with probabilities from centrality-based importance scores to generate views. A graph contrastive objective then learns robust rumor representations. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate RAGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work reveals the wide-structure nature of RPTs and contributes an effective graph contrastive learning approach tailored for rumor detection through principled adaptive augmentation. The proposed principles and augmentation techniques can potentially benefit other applications involving tree-structured graphs.</description>

Abstract: Given a relational specification between inputs and outputs as a logic formula, the problem of functional synthesis is to automatically synthesize a function from inputs to outputs satisfying the relation. Recently, a rich line of work has emerged tackling this problem for specifications in different theories, from Boolean to general first-order logic. In this paper, we launch an investigation of this problem for the theory of Presburger Arithmetic, that we call Presburger Functional Synthesis (PFnS). We show that PFnS can be solved in EXPTIME and provide a matching exponential lower bound. This is unlike the case for Boolean functional synthesis (BFnS), where only conditional exponential lower bounds are known. Further, we show that PFnS for one input and one output variable is as hard as BFnS in general. We then identify a special normal form, called PSyNF, for the specification formula that guarantees poly-time and poly-size solvability of PFnS. We prove several properties of PSyNF, including how to check and compile to this form, and conditions under which any other form that guarantees poly-time solvability of PFnS can be compiled in poly-time to PSyNF. Finally, we identify a syntactic normal form that is easier to check but is exponentially less succinct than PSyNF.</description>

      <title>What One Cannot, Two Can: Two-Layer Transformers Provably Represent Induction Heads on Any-Order Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a hallmark capability of transformers, through which trained models learn to adapt to new tasks by leveraging information from the input context. Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to the presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence between induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling sequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of model depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can efficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart cannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher order Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three layers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a two-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In this paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer transformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional k-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the interplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this, we further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction, focusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating how effective in-context representations emerge during training. Together, these results deepen our current understanding of transformer-based ICL and illustrate how even shallow architectures can surprisingly exhibit strong ICL capabilities on structured sequence modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>Neural Bridge Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning stochastic functions from partially observed context-target pairs is a fundamental problem in probabilistic modeling. Traditional models like Gaussian Processes (GPs) face scalability issues with large datasets and assume Gaussianity, limiting their applicability. While Neural Processes (NPs) offer more flexibility, they struggle with capturing complex, multi-modal target distributions. Neural Diffusion Processes (NDPs) enhance expressivity through a learned diffusion process but rely solely on conditional signals in the denoising network, resulting in weak input coupling from an unconditional forward process and semantic mismatch at the diffusion endpoint. In this work, we propose Neural Bridge Processes (NBPs), a novel method for modeling stochastic functions where inputs x act as dynamic anchors for the entire diffusion trajectory. By reformulating the forward kernel to explicitly depend on x, NBP enforces a constrained path that strictly terminates at the supervised target. This approach not only provides stronger gradient signals but also guarantees endpoint coherence. We validate NBPs on synthetic data, EEG signal regression and image regression tasks, achieving substantial improvements over baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of DDPM-style bridge sampling in enhancing both performance and theoretical consistency for structured prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Agents for Automated Confounder Discovery and Subgroup Analysis in Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating individualized treatment effects from observational data presents a persistent challenge due to unmeasured confounding and structural bias. Causal Machine Learning (causal ML) methods, such as causal trees and doubly robust estimators, provide tools for estimating conditional average treatment effects. These methods have limited effectiveness in complex real-world environments due to the presence of latent confounders or those described in unstructured formats. Moreover, reliance on domain experts for confounder identification and rule interpretation introduces high annotation cost and scalability concerns. In this work, we proposed Large Language Model-based agents for automated confounder discovery and subgroup analysis that integrate agents into the causal ML pipeline to simulate domain expertise. Our framework systematically performs subgroup identification and confounding structure discovery by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents, which reduces human dependency while preserving interpretability. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that our proposed approach enhances treatment effect estimation robustness by narrowing confidence intervals and uncovering unrecognized confounding biases. Our findings suggest that LLM-based agents offer a promising path toward scalable, trustworthy, and semantically aware causal inference.</description>

      <title>Selection and Exploitation of High-Quality Knowledge from Large Language Models for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging the impressive generalization capabilities and reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) to improve the performance of recommenders. With this operation, recommenders can access and learn the additional world knowledge and reasoning information via LLMs. However, in general, for different users and items, the world knowledge derived from LLMs suffers from issues of hallucination, content redundant, and information homogenization. Directly feeding the generated response embeddings into the recommendation model can lead to unavoidable performance deterioration. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge Selection \&amp; Exploitation Recommendation (KSER) framework, which effectively select and extracts the high-quality knowledge from LLMs. The framework consists of two key components: a knowledge filtering module and a embedding spaces alignment module. In the knowledge filtering module, a Embedding Selection Filter Network (ESFNet) is designed to assign adaptive weights to different knowledge chunks in different knowledge fields. In the space alignment module, an attention-based architecture is proposed to align the semantic embeddings from LLMs with the feature space used to train the recommendation models. In addition, two training strategies--\textbf{all-parameters training} and \textbf{extractor-only training}--are proposed to flexibly adapt to different downstream tasks and application scenarios, where the extractor-only training strategy offers a novel perspective on knowledge-augmented recommendation. Experimental results validate the necessity and effectiveness of both the knowledge filtering and alignment modules, and further demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the extractor-only training strategy.</description>

      <title>EDGE: A Theoretical Framework for Misconception-Aware Adaptive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present EDGE, a general-purpose, misconception-aware adaptive learning framework composed of four stages: Evaluate (ability and state estimation), Diagnose (posterior infer-ence of misconceptions), Generate (counterfactual item synthesis), and Exercise (index-based retrieval scheduling). EDGE unifies psychometrics (IRT/Bayesian state space models), cog-nitive diagnostics (misconception discovery from distractor patterns and response latencies), contrastive item generation (minimal perturbations that invalidate learner shortcuts while pre-serving psychometric validity), and principled scheduling (a restless bandit approximation to spaced retrieval). We formalize a composite readiness metric, EdgeScore, prove its monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity, and derive an index policy that is near-optimal under mild assumptions on forgetting and learning gains. We further establish conditions under which counterfactual items provably reduce the posterior probability of a targeted misconception faster than standard practice. The paper focuses on theory and implementable pseudocode; empirical study is left to future work.</description>

      <title>SocRipple: A Two-Stage Framework for Cold-Start Video Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most industry scale recommender systems face critical cold start challenges new items lack interaction history, making it difficult to distribute them in a personalized manner. Standard collaborative filtering models underperform due to sparse engagement signals, while content only approaches lack user specific relevance. We propose SocRipple, a novel two stage retrieval framework tailored for coldstart item distribution in social graph based platforms. Stage 1 leverages the creators social connections for targeted initial exposure. Stage 2 builds on early engagement signals and stable user embeddings learned from historical interactions to "ripple" outwards via K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search. Large scale experiments on a major video platform show that SocRipple boosts cold start item distribution by +36% while maintaining user engagement rate on cold start items, effectively balancing new item exposure with personalized recommendations.</description>

      <title>Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion Model for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heuristic negative sampling enhances recommendation performance by selecting negative samples of varying hardness levels from predefined candidate pools to guide the model toward learning more accurate decision boundaries. However, our empirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental confounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause heuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These misleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations induced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability under distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing negative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process, CNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus reduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal regularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental confounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives that promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive experiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate that CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and robustness in OOD recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>OpenHAIV: A Framework Towards Practical Open-World Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at https://haiv-lab.github.io/openhaiv .</description>

      <title>Incorporating Contextual Paralinguistic Understanding in Large Speech-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current large speech language models (Speech-LLMs) often exhibit limitations in empathetic reasoning, primarily due to the absence of training datasets that integrate both contextual content and paralinguistic cues. In this work, we propose two approaches to incorporate contextual paralinguistic information into model training: (1) an explicit method that provides paralinguistic metadata (e.g., emotion annotations) directly to the LLM, and (2) an implicit method that automatically generates novel training question-answer (QA) pairs using both categorical and dimensional emotion annotations alongside speech transcriptions. Our implicit method boosts performance (LLM-judged) by 38.41% on a human-annotated QA benchmark, reaching 46.02% when combined with the explicit approach, showing effectiveness in contextual paralinguistic understanding. We also validate the LLM judge by demonstrating its correlation with classification metrics, providing support for its reliability.</description>

      <title>MAQuA: Adaptive Question-Asking for Multidimensional Mental Health Screening using Item Response Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding internal feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a fundamental step toward model interpretability. Inspired by neuroscience methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its generalizability and interpretive value.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Large Language Models Using EEG Microstate Features for Mental Workload Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the intersection of electroencephalography (EEG) microstates and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the assessment of cognitive load states. By utilizing EEG microstate features, the research aims to fine-tune LLMs for improved predictions of distinct cognitive states, specifically 'Rest' and 'Load'. The experimental design is delineated in four comprehensive stages: dataset collection and preprocessing, microstate segmentation and EEG backfitting, feature extraction paired with prompt engineering, and meticulous LLM model selection and refinement. Employing a supervised learning paradigm, the LLM is trained to identify cognitive load states based on EEG microstate features integrated into prompts, producing accurate discrimination of cognitive load. A curated dataset, linking EEG features to specified cognitive load conditions, underpins the experimental framework. The results indicate a significant improvement in model performance following the proposed fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of EEG-informed LLMs in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive AI applications. This approach not only contributes to the understanding of brain dynamics but also paves the way for advancements in machine learning techniques applicable to cognitive load and cognitive AI research.</description>

      <title>"Pull or Not to Pull?'': Investigating Moral Biases in Leading Large Language Models Across Ethical Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate ethically sensitive decisions, understanding their moral reasoning processes becomes imperative. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 14 leading LLMs, both reasoning enabled and general purpose, across 27 diverse trolley problem scenarios, framed by ten moral philosophies, including utilitarianism, deontology, and altruism. Using a factorial prompting protocol, we elicited 3,780 binary decisions and natural language justifications, enabling analysis along axes of decisional assertiveness, explanation answer consistency, public moral alignment, and sensitivity to ethically irrelevant cues. Our findings reveal significant variability across ethical frames and model types: reasoning enhanced models demonstrate greater decisiveness and structured justifications, yet do not always align better with human consensus. Notably, "sweet zones" emerge in altruistic, fairness, and virtue ethics framings, where models achieve a balance of high intervention rates, low explanation conflict, and minimal divergence from aggregated human judgments. However, models diverge under frames emphasizing kinship, legality, or self interest, often producing ethically controversial outcomes. These patterns suggest that moral prompting is not only a behavioral modifier but also a diagnostic tool for uncovering latent alignment philosophies across providers. We advocate for moral reasoning to become a primary axis in LLM alignment, calling for standardized benchmarks that evaluate not just what LLMs decide, but how and why.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of data attribution is to trace the model's predictions through the learning algorithm and back to its training data. thereby identifying the most influential training samples and understanding how the model's behavior leads to particular predictions. Understanding how individual training examples influence a model's predictions is fundamental for machine learning interpretability, data debugging, and model accountability. Influence functions, originating from robust statistics, offer an efficient, first-order approximation to estimate the impact of marginally upweighting or removing a data point on a model's learned parameters and its subsequent predictions, without the need for expensive retraining. This paper comprehensively reviews the data attribution capability of influence functions in deep learning. We discuss their theoretical foundations, recent algorithmic advances for efficient inverse-Hessian-vector product estimation, and evaluate their effectiveness for data attribution and mislabel detection. Finally, highlighting current challenges and promising directions for unleashing the huge potential of influence functions in large-scale, real-world deep learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>When Is Prior Knowledge Helpful? Exploring the Evaluation and Selection of Unsupervised Pretext Tasks from a Neuro-Symbolic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (Nesy) learning improves the target task performance of models by enabling them to satisfy knowledge, while semi/self-supervised learning (SSL) improves the target task performance by designing unsupervised pretext tasks for unlabeled data to make models satisfy corresponding assumptions. We extend the Nesy theory based on reliable knowledge to the scenario of unreliable knowledge (i.e., assumptions), thereby unifying the theoretical frameworks of SSL and Nesy. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that, in theory, the impact of pretext tasks on target performance hinges on three factors: knowledge learnability with respect to the model, knowledge reliability with respect to the data, and knowledge completeness with respect to the target. We further propose schemes to operationalize these theoretical metrics, and thereby develop a method that can predict the effectiveness of pretext tasks in advance. This will change the current status quo in practical applications, where the selections of unsupervised tasks are heuristic-based rather than theory-based, and it is difficult to evaluate the rationality of unsupervised pretext task selection before testing the model on the target task. In experiments, we verify a high correlation between the predicted performance-estimated using minimal data-and the actual performance achieved after large-scale semi-supervised or self-supervised learning, thus confirming the validity of the theory and the effectiveness of the evaluation method.</description>

      <title>From Knowledge to Conjectures: A Modal Framework for Reasoning about Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of cognitive modal logics designed to formalize conjectural reasoning: a modal system in which cognitive contexts extend known facts with hypothetical assumptions to explore their consequences. Unlike traditional doxastic and epistemic systems, conjectural logics rely on a principle, called Axiom C ($\varphi \rightarrow \Box\varphi$), that ensures that all established facts are preserved across hypothetical layers. While Axiom C was dismissed in the past due to its association with modal collapse, we show that the collapse only arises under classical and bivalent assumptions, and specifically in the presence of Axiom T. Hence we avoid Axiom T and adopt a paracomplete semantic framework, grounded in Weak Kleene logic or Description Logic, where undefined propositions coexist with modal assertions. This prevents the modal collapse and guarantees a layering to distinguish between factual and conjectural statements. Under this framework we define new modal systems, e.g., KC and KDC, and show that they are complete, decidable, and robust under partial knowledge. Finally, we introduce a dynamic operation, $\mathsf{settle}(\varphi)$, which formalizes the transition from conjecture to accepted fact, capturing the event of the update of a world's cognitive state through the resolution of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>DragonFruitQualityNet: A Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network for Real-Time Dragon Fruit Quality Inspection on Mobile Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dragon fruit, renowned for its nutritional benefits and economic value, has experienced rising global demand due to its affordability and local availability. As dragon fruit cultivation expands, efficient pre- and post-harvest quality inspection has become essential for improving agricultural productivity and minimizing post-harvest losses. This study presents DragonFruitQualityNet, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for real-time quality assessment of dragon fruits on mobile devices. We curated a diverse dataset of 13,789 images, integrating self-collected samples with public datasets (dataset from Mendeley Data), and classified them into four categories: fresh, immature, mature, and defective fruits to ensure robust model training. The proposed model achieves an impressive 93.98% accuracy, outperforming existing methods in fruit quality classification. To facilitate practical adoption, we embedded the model into an intuitive mobile application, enabling farmers and agricultural stakeholders to conduct on-device, real-time quality inspections. This research provides an accurate, efficient, and scalable AI-driven solution for dragon fruit quality control, supporting digital agriculture and empowering smallholder farmers with accessible technology. By bridging the gap between research and real-world application, our work advances post-harvest management and promotes sustainable farming practices.</description>

      <title>MCITlib: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning Library and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning aims to equip AI systems with the ability to continuously acquire and adapt to new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information, similar to human learning. While traditional continual learning methods focusing on unimodal tasks have achieved notable success, the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models has brought increasing attention to Multimodal Continual Learning tasks involving multiple modalities, such as vision and language. In this setting, models are expected to not only mitigate catastrophic forgetting but also handle the challenges posed by cross-modal interactions and coordination. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce MCITlib, a comprehensive and constantly evolving code library for continual instruction tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models. In MCITlib, we have currently implemented 8 representative algorithms for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning and systematically evaluated them on 2 carefully selected benchmarks. MCITlib will be continuously updated to reflect advances in the Multimodal Continual Learning field. The codebase is released at https://github.com/Ghy0501/MCITlib.</description>

      <title>HealthBranches: Synthesizing Clinically-Grounded Question Answering Datasets via Decision Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HealthBranches is a novel benchmark dataset for medical Question-Answering (Q&amp;A), specifically designed to evaluate complex reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). This dataset is generated through a semi-automated pipeline that transforms explicit decision pathways from medical source into realistic patient cases with associated questions and answers. Covering 4,063 case studies across 17 healthcare topics, each data point is based on clinically validated reasoning chains. HealthBranches supports both open-ended and multiple-choice question formats and uniquely includes the full reasoning path for each Q&amp;A. Its structured design enables robust evaluation of LLMs' multi-step inference capabilities, including their performance in structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) contexts. HealthBranches establishes a foundation for the development of more trustworthy, interpretable, and clinically reliable LLMs in high-stakes domains while also serving as a valuable resource for educational purposes.</description>

      <title>FlexCTC: GPU-powered CTC Beam Decoding with advanced Contextual Abilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While beam search improves speech recognition quality over greedy decoding, standard implementations are slow, often sequential, and CPU-bound. To fully leverage modern hardware capabilities, we present a novel open-source FlexCTC toolkit for fully GPU-based beam decoding, designed for Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) models. Developed entirely in Python and PyTorch, it offers a fast, user-friendly, and extensible alternative to traditional C++, CUDA, or WFST-based decoders. The toolkit features a high-performance, fully batched GPU implementation with eliminated CPU-GPU synchronization and minimized kernel launch overhead via CUDA Graphs. It also supports advanced contextualization techniques, including GPU-powered N-gram language model fusion and phrase-level boosting. These features enable accurate and efficient decoding, making them suitable for both research and production use.</description>

      <title>ObfusQAte: A Proposed Framework to Evaluate LLM Robustness on Obfuscated Factual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly contributed to the development of equitable AI systems capable of factual question-answering (QA). However, no known study tests the LLMs' robustness when presented with obfuscated versions of questions. To systematically evaluate these limitations, we propose a novel technique, ObfusQAte and, leveraging the same, introduce ObfusQA, a comprehensive, first of its kind, framework with multi-tiered obfuscation levels designed to examine LLM capabilities across three distinct dimensions: (i) Named-Entity Indirection, (ii) Distractor Indirection, and (iii) Contextual Overload. By capturing these fine-grained distinctions in language, ObfusQA provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM robustness and adaptability. Our study observes that LLMs exhibit a tendency to fail or generate hallucinated responses when confronted with these increasingly nuanced variations. To foster research in this direction, we make ObfusQAte publicly available.</description>

      <title>Strategies of Code-switching in Human-Machine Dialogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most people are multilingual, and most multilinguals code-switch, yet the characteristics of code-switched language are not fully understood. We developed a chatbot capable of completing a Map Task with human participants using code-switched Spanish and English. In two experiments, we prompted the bot to code-switch according to different strategies, examining (1) the feasibility of such experiments for investigating bilingual language use, and (2) whether participants would be sensitive to variations in discourse and grammatical patterns. Participants generally enjoyed code-switching with our bot as long as it produced predictable code-switching behavior; when code-switching was random or ungrammatical (as when producing unattested incongruent mixed-language noun phrases, such as `la fork'), participants enjoyed the task less and were less successful at completing it. These results underscore the potential downsides of deploying insufficiently developed multilingual language technology, while also illustrating the promise of such technology for conducting research on bilingual language use.</description>

      <title>Efficient Edge LLMs Deployment via HessianAware Quantization and CPU GPU Collaborative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the breakthrough progress of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing and multimodal tasks, efficiently deploying them on resource-constrained edge devices has become a critical challenge. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse activation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The presence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe degradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights, significantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory, efficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to balance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ) and CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian matrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and weights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers while ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we design an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which, combined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment and scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory footprint and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method on mainstream large models such as the OPT series and Mixtral 8*7B: on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, the inference accuracy of the low-bit quantized model approaches that of the full-precision model, while GPU memory usage is reduced by about 60%, and inference latency is significantly improved.</description>

      <title>ProteoKnight: Convolution-based phage virion protein classification and uncertainty analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \textbf{Introduction:} Accurate prediction of Phage Virion Proteins (PVP) is essential for genomic studies due to their crucial role as structural elements in bacteriophages. Computational tools, particularly machine learning, have emerged for annotating phage protein sequences from high-throughput sequencing. However, effective annotation requires specialized sequence encodings. Our paper introduces ProteoKnight, a new image-based encoding method that addresses spatial constraints in existing techniques, yielding competitive performance in PVP classification using pre-trained convolutional neural networks. Additionally, our study evaluates prediction uncertainty in binary PVP classification through Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD). \textbf{Methods:} ProteoKnight adapts the classical DNA-Walk algorithm for protein sequences, incorporating pixel colors and adjusting walk distances to capture intricate protein features. Encoded sequences were classified using multiple pre-trained CNNs. Variance and entropy measures assessed prediction uncertainty across proteins of various classes and lengths. \textbf{Results:} Our experiments achieved 90.8% accuracy in binary classification, comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Multi-class classification accuracy remains suboptimal. Our uncertainty analysis unveils variability in prediction confidence influenced by protein class and sequence length. \textbf{Conclusions:} Our study surpasses frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) by introducing novel image encoding that mitigates spatial information loss limitations. Our classification technique yields accurate and robust PVP predictions while identifying low-confidence predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the complexity of software systems continues to increase, the demand for automated testing and maintenance tools is growing exponentially. To meet this urgent need, we propose a new assertion generation method based on Hardware Description Language (HDL). This method combines a lightweight, parameter-adjustable large language model (LLM) with the Unsloth platform to automatically generate test cases, thereby significantly reducing training costs without sacrificing accuracy or generalization performance. Empirical evaluation shows that our method can efficiently generate assertions that strictly conform to the hardware logic. This framework provides a robust and flexible solution to modern software testing and maintenance challenges. https://github.com/liusu-orange/AutoAssert-1 and https://gitee.com/OpenBPU/auto-assert1 are the locations of the source code.</description>

      <title>Urbanite: A Dataflow-Based Framework for Human-AI Interactive Alignment in Urban Visual Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing availability of urban data and the increasing complexity of societal challenges, visual analytics has become essential for deriving insights into pressing real-world problems. However, analyzing such data is inherently complex and iterative, requiring expertise across multiple domains. The need to manage diverse datasets, distill intricate workflows, and integrate various analytical methods presents a high barrier to entry, especially for researchers and urban experts who lack proficiency in data management, machine learning, and visualization. Advancements in large language models offer a promising solution to lower the barriers to the construction of analytics systems by enabling users to specify intent rather than define precise computational operations. However, this shift from explicit operations to intent-based interaction introduces challenges in ensuring alignment throughout the design and development process. Without proper mechanisms, gaps can emerge between user intent, system behavior, and analytical outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose Urbanite, a framework for human-AI collaboration in urban visual analytics. Urbanite leverages a dataflow-based model that allows users to specify intent at multiple scopes, enabling interactive alignment across the specification, process, and evaluation stages of urban analytics. Based on findings from a survey to uncover challenges, Urbanite incorporates features to facilitate explainability, multi-resolution definition of tasks across dataflows, nodes, and parameters, while supporting the provenance of interactions. We demonstrate Urbanite's effectiveness through usage scenarios created in collaboration with urban experts. Urbanite is available at https://urbantk.org/urbanite.</description>

      <title>A Spin Glass Characterization of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a statistical mechanics characterization of neural networks, motivated by the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) phenomenon in spin glasses. A Hopfield-type spin glass model is constructed from a given feedforward neural network (FNN). Overlaps between simulated replica samples serve as a characteristic descriptor of the FNN. The connection between the spin-glass description and commonly studied properties of the FNN -- such as data fitting, capacity, generalization, and robustness -- has been investigated and empirically demonstrated. Unlike prior analytical studies that focus on model ensembles, this method provides a computable descriptor for individual network instances, which reveals nontrivial structural properties that are not captured by conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy. Preliminary results suggests its potential for practical applications such as model inspection, safety verification, and detection of hidden vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>AgriVLN: Vision-and-Language Navigation for Agricultural Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agricultural robots have emerged as powerful members in agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or untransportable railway for movement, resulting in limited mobility and poor adaptability. Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) enables robots to navigate to the target destinations following natural language instructions, demonstrating strong performance on several domains. However, none of the existing benchmarks or methods is specifically designed for agricultural scenes. To bridge this gap, we propose Agriculture to Agriculture (A2A) benchmark, containing 1,560 episodes across six diverse agricultural scenes, in which all realistic RGB videos are captured by front-facing camera on a quadruped robot at a height of 0.38 meters, aligning with the practical deployment conditions. Meanwhile, we propose Vision-and-Language Navigation for Agricultural Robots (AgriVLN) baseline based on Vision-Language Model (VLM) prompted with carefully crafted templates, which can understand both given instructions and agricultural environments to generate appropriate low-level actions for robot control. When evaluated on A2A, AgriVLN performs well on short instructions but struggles with long instructions, because it often fails to track which part of the instruction is currently being executed. To address this, we further propose Subtask List (STL) instruction decomposition module and integrate it into AgriVLN, improving Success Rate (SR) from 0.33 to 0.47. We additionally compare AgriVLN with several existing VLN methods, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.</description>

Abstract: Reliable long-lead forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains a long-standing challenge in climate science. The previously developed Multimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two independent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are combined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other as a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of individual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the model to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this study, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to directly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By constructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose weights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and cluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an optimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final prediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method improves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble coherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical characteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights. In addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always outperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and consistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations. The approach is model-agnostic too, suggesting that it can be applied directly to other forecasting models with gargantuan ensemble outputs, such as statistical, physical, or hybrid models.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Analysis of Unstructured Data with Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Architectures</title>

Abstract: As the particle physics community needs higher and higher precisions in order to test our current model of the subatomic world, larger and larger datasets are necessary. With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.</description>

      <title>Lightning Prediction under Uncertainty: DeepLight with Hazy Loss</title>

Abstract: Lightning, a common feature of severe meteorological conditions, poses significant risks, from direct human injuries to substantial economic losses. These risks are further exacerbated by climate change. Early and accurate prediction of lightning would enable preventive measures to safeguard people, protect property, and minimize economic losses. In this paper, we present DeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning occurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: they often struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and inherent uncertainty of lightning events, underutilize key observational data, such as radar reflectivity and cloud properties, and rely heavily on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly sensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight leverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud properties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder architecture. By employing multi-branch convolution techniques, it dynamically captures spatial correlations across varying extents. Furthermore, its novel Hazy Loss function explicitly addresses the spatio-temporal uncertainty of lightning by penalizing deviations based on proximity to true events, enabling the model to better learn patterns amidst randomness. Extensive experiments show that DeepLight improves the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 18%-30% over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a robust solution for lightning prediction.</description>

      <title>Freeze and Reveal: Exposing Modality Bias in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models achieve impressive multi-modal performance but often inherit gender biases from their training data. This bias might be coming from both the vision and text modalities. In this work, we dissect the contributions of vision and text backbones to these biases by applying targeted debiasing using Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Task Vector methods. Inspired by data-efficient approaches in hate-speech classification, we introduce a novel metric, Degree of Stereotypicality and a corresponding debiasing method, Data Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality - DAUDoS, to reduce bias with minimal computational cost. We curate a gender annotated dataset and evaluate all methods on VisoGender benchmark to quantify improvements and identify dominant source of bias. Our results show that CDA reduces the gender gap by 6% and DAUDoS by 3% but using only one-third of the data. Both methods also improve the model's ability to correctly identify gender in images by 3%, with DAUDoS achieving this improvement using only almost one-third of training data. From our experiment's, we observed that CLIP's vision encoder is more biased whereas PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased. By identifying whether bias stems more from vision or text encoders, our work enables more targeted and effective bias mitigation strategies in future multi-modal systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Districting Plans to Maximize Majority-Minority Districts via IPs and Local Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In redistricting litigation, effective enforcement of the Voting Rights Act has often involved providing the court with districting plans that display a larger number of majority-minority districts than the current proposal (as was true, for example, in what followed Allen v. Milligan concerning the congressional districting plan for Alabama in 2023). Recent work by Cannon et al. proposed a heuristic algorithm for generating plans to optimize majority-minority districts, which they called short bursts; that algorithm relies on a sophisticated random walk over the space of all plans, transitioning in bursts, where the initial plan for each burst is the most successful plan from the previous burst. We propose a method based on integer programming, where we build upon another previous work, the stochastic hierarchical partitioning algorithm, which heuristically generates a robust set of potential districts (viewed as columns in a standard set partitioning formulation); that approach was designed to optimize a different notion of fairness across a statewide plan. We design a new column generation algorithm to find plans via integer programming that outperforms short bursts on multiple data sets in generating statewide plans with significantly more majority-minority districts. These results also rely on a new local re-optimization algorithm to iteratively improve on any baseline solution, as well as an algorithm to increase the compactness of districts in plans generated (without impacting the number of majority-minority districts).</description>

      <title>Stackelberg Coupling of Online Representation Learning and Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated, end-to-end learning of representations and policies remains a cornerstone of deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, to address the challenge of learning effective features from a sparse reward signal, recent trends have shifted towards adding complex auxiliary objectives or fully decoupling the two processes, often at the cost of increased design complexity. This work proposes an alternative to both decoupling and naive end-to-end learning, arguing that performance can be significantly improved by structuring the interaction between distinct perception and control networks with a principled, game-theoretic dynamic. We formalize this dynamic by introducing the Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER) framework, which models the interaction between perception and control as a Stackelberg game. The perception network (leader) strategically learns features to benefit the control network (follower), whose own objective is to minimize its Bellman error. We approximate the game's equilibrium with a practical two-timescale algorithm. Applied to standard DQN variants on benchmark tasks, SCORER improves sample efficiency and final performance. Our results show that performance gains can be achieved through principled algorithmic design of the perception-control dynamic, without requiring complex auxiliary objectives or architectures.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Generative Microscopic Traffic Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling individual vehicle behavior in microscopic traffic simulation remains a key challenge in intelligent transportation systems, as it requires vehicles to realistically generate and respond to complex traffic phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. While traditional human driver simulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting away the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent advances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled the extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift toward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most existing datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing to reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from vehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion through overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based sensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic engineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset (I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic level of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning problem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing from noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt existing generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with noise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only outperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly engaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a stepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that embraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.</description>

      <title>ALOPE: Adaptive Layer Optimization for Translation Quality Estimation using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine Translation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without relying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for LLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based QE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than regression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource languages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an adaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by restructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for improved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank adapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained Transformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the layer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting, which adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head regression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our framework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches. Empirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs provide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual nature of the QE task. We make resultant models and framework code publicly available for further research, also allowing existing LLM-based MT frameworks to be scaled with QE capabilities.</description>

      <title>Extracting Overlapping Microservices from Monolithic Code via Deep Semantic Embeddings and Graph Neural Network-Based Soft Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern software systems are increasingly shifting from monolithic architectures to microservices to enhance scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility. Existing microservice extraction methods typically rely on hard clustering, assigning each software component to a single microservice. This approach often increases inter-service coupling and reduces intra-service cohesion. We propose Mo2oM (Monolithic to Overlapping Microservices), a framework that formulates microservice extraction as a soft clustering problem, allowing components to belong probabilistically to multiple microservices. This approach is inspired by expert-driven decompositions, where practitioners intentionally replicate certain software components across services to reduce communication overhead. Mo2oM combines deep semantic embeddings with structural dependencies extracted from methodcall graphs to capture both functional and architectural relationships. A graph neural network-based soft clustering algorithm then generates the final set of microservices. We evaluate Mo2oM on four open-source monolithic benchmarks and compare it against eight state-of-the-art baselines. Our results demonstrate that Mo2oM achieves improvements of up to 40.97% in structural modularity (balancing cohesion and coupling), 58% in inter-service call percentage (communication overhead), 26.16% in interface number (modularity and decoupling), and 38.96% in non-extreme distribution (service size balance) across all benchmarks.</description>

      <title>From Product Hilbert Spaces to the Generalized Koopman Operator and the Nonlinear Fundamental Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalization of the Koopman operator to systems with control input and the derivation of a nonlinear fundamental lemma are two open problems that play a key role in the development of data-driven control methods for nonlinear systems. Both problems hinge on the construction of observable or basis functions and their corresponding Hilbert space that enable an infinite-dimensional, linear system representation. In this paper we derive a novel solution to these problems based on orthonormal expansion in a product Hilbert space constructed as the tensor product between the Hilbert spaces of the state and input observable functions, respectively. We prove that there exists an infinite-dimensional linear operator, i.e. the generalized Koopman operator, from the constructed product Hilbert space to the Hilbert space corresponding to the lifted state propagated forward in time. A scalable data-driven method for computing finite-dimensional approximations of generalized Koopman operators and several choices of observable functions are also presented. Moreover, we derive a nonlinear fundamental lemma by exploiting the bilinear structure of the infinite-dimensional generalized Koopman model. The effectiveness of the developed generalized Koopman embedding is illustrated on the Van der Pol oscillator.</description>

      <title>VA-Blueprint: Uncovering Building Blocks for Visual Analytics System Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing and building visual analytics (VA) systems is a complex, iterative process that requires the seamless integration of data processing, analytics capabilities, and visualization techniques. While prior research has extensively examined the social and collaborative aspects of VA system authoring, the practical challenges of developing these systems remain underexplored. As a result, despite the growing number of VA systems, there are only a few structured knowledge bases to guide their design and development. To tackle this gap, we propose VA-Blueprint, a methodology and knowledge base that systematically reviews and categorizes the fundamental building blocks of urban VA systems, a domain particularly rich and representative due to its intricate data and unique problem sets. Applying this methodology to an initial set of 20 systems, we identify and organize their core components into a multi-level structure, forming an initial knowledge base with a structured blueprint for VA system development. To scale this effort, we leverage a large language model to automate the extraction of these components for other 81 papers (completing a corpus of 101 papers), assessing its effectiveness in scaling knowledge base construction. We evaluate our method through interviews with experts and a quantitative analysis of annotation metrics. Our contributions provide a deeper understanding of VA systems' composition and establish a practical foundation to support more structured, reproducible, and efficient system development. VA-Blueprint is available at https://urbantk.org/va-blueprint.</description>

      <title>Intersectoral Knowledge in AI and Urban Studies: A Framework for Transdisciplinary Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transdisciplinary approaches are increasingly essential for addressing grand societal challenges, particularly in complex domains such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), urban planning, and social sciences. However, effectively validating and integrating knowledge across distinct epistemic and ontological perspectives poses significant difficulties. This article proposes a six-dimensional framework for assessing and strengthening transdisciplinary knowledge validity in AI and city studies, based on an extensive analysis of the most cited research (2014--2024). Specifically, the framework classifies research orientations according to ontological, epistemological, methodological, teleological, axiological, and valorization dimensions. Our findings show a predominance of perspectives aligned with critical realism (ontological), positivism (epistemological), analytical methods (methodological), consequentialism (teleological), epistemic values (axiological), and social/economic valorization. Less common stances, such as idealism, mixed methods, and cultural valorization, are also examined for their potential to enrich knowledge production. We highlight how early career researchers and transdisciplinary teams can leverage this framework to reconcile divergent disciplinary viewpoints and promote socially accountable outcomes.</description>

      <title>From Field to Drone: Domain Drift Tolerant Automated Multi-Species and Damage Plant Semantic Segmentation for Herbicide Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field trials are vital in herbicide research and development to assess effects on crops and weeds under varied conditions. Traditionally, evaluations rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and consistency.
  We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data (year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year 2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model.
  Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to 0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to 0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species: F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where earlier models failed.
  These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.</description>

      <title>Word Clouds as Common Voices: LLM-Assisted Visualization of Participant-Weighted Themes in Qualitative Interviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Word clouds are a common way to summarize qualitative interviews, yet traditional frequency-based methods often fail in conversational contexts: they surface filler words, ignore paraphrase, and fragment semantically related ideas. This limits their usefulness in early-stage analysis, when researchers need fast, interpretable overviews of what participant actually said. We introduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds from dialogue transcripts. The system prompts an LLM to identify concept-level themes across a corpus and then counts how many unique participants mention each topic, yielding a visualization grounded in breadth of mention rather than raw term frequency. Researchers can customize prompts and visualization parameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user study comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155 transcripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device concerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA, BERTopic). We discuss design trade-offs for integrating LLM assistance into qualitative workflows, implications for interpretability and researcher agency, and opportunities for interactive analyses such as per-condition contrasts (``diff clouds'').</description>

      <title>Conversational DNA: A New Visual Language for Understanding Dialogue Structure in Human and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What if the patterns hidden within dialogue reveal more about communication than the words themselves? We introduce Conversational DNA, a novel visual language that treats any dialogue -- whether between humans, between human and AI, or among groups -- as a living system with interpretable structure that can be visualized, compared, and understood. Unlike traditional conversation analysis that reduces rich interaction to statistical summaries, our approach reveals the temporal architecture of dialogue through biological metaphors. Linguistic complexity flows through strand thickness, emotional trajectories cascade through color gradients, conversational relevance forms through connecting elements, and topic coherence maintains structural integrity through helical patterns. Through exploratory analysis of therapeutic conversations and historically significant human-AI dialogues, we demonstrate how this visualization approach reveals interaction patterns that traditional methods miss. Our work contributes a new creative framework for understanding communication that bridges data visualization, human-computer interaction, and the fundamental question of what makes dialogue meaningful in an age where humans increasingly converse with artificial minds.</description>

      <title>A DICOM Image De-identification Algorithm in the MIDI-B Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image de-identification is essential for the public sharing of medical images, particularly in the widely used Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format as required by various regulations and standards, including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rules, the DICOM PS3.15 standard, and best practices recommended by the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B) Challenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate rule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of clinical DICOM images. In this report, we explore the critical challenges of de-identifying DICOM images, emphasize the importance of removing personally identifiable information (PII) to protect patient privacy while ensuring the continued utility of medical data for research, diagnostics, and treatment, and provide a comprehensive overview of the standards and regulations that govern this process. Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied - such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text replacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in strict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of the MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly executed 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that completed the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams). Finally, we conducted a thorough analysis of the resulting statistics and discussed the limitations of current approaches and potential avenues for future improvement.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Driven Reliability: Selective Prediction and Trustworthy Deployment in Modern Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains where reliability is paramount. This thesis investigates how uncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML, focusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is low.
  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty signals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By ensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight, post-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep ensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance. Crucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP), allowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find that while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains robust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty trade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective classification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve -- identifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions can close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking errors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show that uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or deny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining calibration audits with verifiable inference.
  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating, and safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make accurate predictions -- but also know when to say "I do not know".</description>

      <title>A Small-footprint Acoustic Echo Cancellation Solution for Mobile Full-Duplex Speech Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In full-duplex speech interaction systems, effective Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) is crucial for recovering echo-contaminated speech. This paper presents a neural network-based AEC solution to address challenges in mobile scenarios with varying hardware, nonlinear distortions and long latency. We first incorporate diverse data augmentation strategies to enhance the model's robustness across various environments. Moreover, progressive learning is employed to incrementally improve AEC effectiveness, resulting in a considerable improvement in speech quality. To further optimize AEC's downstream applications, we introduce a novel post-processing strategy employing tailored parameters designed specifically for tasks such as Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), thus enhancing their overall efficacy. Finally, our method employs a small-footprint model with streaming inference, enabling seamless deployment on mobile devices. Empirical results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method in Echo Return Loss Enhancement and Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality, alongside significant improvements in both VAD and ASR results.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent System for Rapid Statement of Work Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drafting a Statement of Work (SOW) is a vital part of business and legal projects. It outlines key details like deliverables, timelines, responsibilities, and legal terms. However, creating these documents is often a slow and complex process. It usually involves multiple people, takes several days, and leaves room for errors or outdated content. This paper introduces a new AI-driven automation system that makes the entire SOW drafting process faster, easier, and more accurate. Instead of relying completely on humans, the system uses three intelligent components or 'agents' that each handle a part of the job. One agent writes the first draft, another checks if everything is legally correct, and the third agent formats the document and ensures everything is in order. Unlike basic online tools that just fill in templates, this system understands the meaning behind the content and customizes the SOW to match the needs of the project. It also checks legal compliance and formatting so that users can trust the result. The system was tested using real business examples. It was able to create a full SOW in under three minutes, compared to several hours or days using manual methods. It also performed well in accuracy and quality, showing that it can reduce legal risks and save a lot of time. This solution shows how artificial intelligence can be used to support legal and business professionals by taking care of routine work and helping them focus on more important decisions. It's a step toward making legal processes smarter, faster, and more reliable.</description>

      <title>Towards Theoretical Understanding of Transformer Test-Time Computing: Investigation on In-Context Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using more test-time computation during language model inference, such as generating more intermediate thoughts or sampling multiple candidate answers, has proven effective in significantly improving model performance. This paper takes an initial step toward bridging the gap between practical language model inference and theoretical transformer analysis by incorporating randomness and sampling. We focus on in-context linear regression with continuous/binary coefficients, where our framework simulates language model decoding through noise injection and binary coefficient sampling. Through this framework, we provide detailed analyses of widely adopted inference techniques. Supported by empirical results, our theoretical framework and analysis demonstrate the potential for offering new insights into understanding inference behaviors in real-world language models.</description>

      <title>IBPS: Indian Bail Prediction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bail decisions are among the most frequently adjudicated matters in Indian courts, yet they remain plagued by subjectivity, delays, and inconsistencies. With over 75% of India's prison population comprising undertrial prisoners, many from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, the lack of timely and fair bail adjudication exacerbates human rights concerns and contributes to systemic judicial backlog. In this paper, we present the Indian Bail Prediction System (IBPS), an AI-powered framework designed to assist in bail decision-making by predicting outcomes and generating legally sound rationales based solely on factual case attributes and statutory provisions. We curate and release a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched with structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime category, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a large language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its performance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context, and with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory knowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and explanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated by legal experts. IBPS offers a transparent, scalable, and reproducible solution to support data-driven legal assistance, reduce bail delays, and promote procedural fairness in the Indian judicial system.</description>

      <title>ShoulderShot: Generating Over-the-Shoulder Dialogue Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are essential in films, short dramas, and advertisements, providing visual variety and enhancing viewers' emotional connection. Despite their importance, such dialogue scenes remain largely underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new possibilities for practical dialogue video generation. Videos and comparisons are available at https://shouldershot.github.io.</description>

      <title>On the Limits of Selective AI Prediction: A Case Study in Clinical Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI has the potential to augment human decision making. However, even high-performing models can produce inaccurate predictions when deployed. These inaccuracies, combined with automation bias, where humans overrely on AI predictions, can result in worse decisions. Selective prediction, in which potentially unreliable model predictions are hidden from users, has been proposed as a solution. This approach assumes that when AI abstains and informs the user so, humans make decisions as they would without AI involvement. To test this assumption, we study the effects of selective prediction on human decisions in a clinical context. We conducted a user study of 259 clinicians tasked with diagnosing and treating hospitalized patients. We compared their baseline performance without any AI involvement to their AI-assisted accuracy with and without selective prediction. Our findings indicate that selective prediction mitigates the negative effects of inaccurate AI in terms of decision accuracy. Compared to no AI assistance, clinician accuracy declined when shown inaccurate AI predictions (66% [95% CI: 56%-75%] vs. 56% [95% CI: 46%-66%]), but recovered under selective prediction (64% [95% CI: 54%-73%]). However, while selective prediction nearly maintains overall accuracy, our results suggest that it alters patterns of mistakes: when informed the AI abstains, clinicians underdiagnose (18% increase in missed diagnoses) and undertreat (35% increase in missed treatments) compared to no AI input at all. Our findings underscore the importance of empirically validating assumptions about how humans engage with AI within human-AI systems.</description>

      <title>SOFA: Deep Learning Framework for Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable. Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration, temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization, offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.</description>

      <title>Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07629v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5% on AIME 2024, 83.2% on AIME 2025, 66.0% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1% on LiveCodeBench V6.</description>

      <title>InterChart: Benchmarking Visual Reasoning Across Decomposed and Distributed Chart Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce InterChart, a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates how well vision-language models (VLMs) reason across multiple related charts, a task central to real-world applications such as scientific reporting, financial analysis, and public policy dashboards. Unlike prior benchmarks focusing on isolated, visually uniform charts, InterChart challenges models with diverse question types ranging from entity inference and trend correlation to numerical estimation and abstract multi-step reasoning grounded in 2-3 thematically or structurally related charts. We organize the benchmark into three tiers of increasing difficulty: (1) factual reasoning over individual charts, (2) integrative analysis across synthetically aligned chart sets, and (3) semantic inference over visually complex, real-world chart pairs. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs reveals consistent and steep accuracy declines as chart complexity increases. We find that models perform better when we decompose multi-entity charts into simpler visual units, underscoring their struggles with cross-chart integration. By exposing these systematic limitations, InterChart provides a rigorous framework for advancing multimodal reasoning in complex, multi-visual environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Approximate Posterior Sampling with Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling in the context of score based generative models. We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a measurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior $p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case) under well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular algorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and reconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional assumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is tractable, we view this as a more general "tilting" problem of biasing a distribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one can tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the posterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher divergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is consistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our knowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior sampling in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Attribution Explanations for Deep Neural Networks: A Theoretical Perspective</title>

Abstract: Attribution explanation is a typical approach for explaining deep neural networks (DNNs), inferring an importance or contribution score for each input variable to the final output. In recent years, numerous attribution methods have been developed to explain DNNs. However, a persistent concern remains unresolved, i.e., whether and which attribution methods faithfully reflect the actual contribution of input variables to the decision-making process. The faithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of attribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core challenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to their unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and implementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack solid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent, ambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is challenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a promising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention. We summarize these developments, with emphasis on three key directions: (i) Theoretical unification, which uncovers commonalities and differences among methods, enabling systematic comparisons; (ii) Theoretical rationale, clarifying the foundations of existing methods; (iii) Theoretical evaluation, rigorously proving whether methods satisfy faithfulness principles. Beyond a comprehensive review, we provide insights into how these studies help deepen theoretical understanding, inform method selection, and inspire new attribution methods. We conclude with a discussion of promising open problems for further work.</description>

      <title>Grasp-HGN: Grasping the Unexpected</title>

Abstract: For transradial amputees, robotic prosthetic hands promise to regain the capability to perform daily living activities. To advance next-generation prosthetic hand control design, it is crucial to address current shortcomings in robustness to out of lab artifacts, and generalizability to new environments. Due to the fixed number of object to interact with in existing datasets, contrasted with the virtually infinite variety of objects encountered in the real world, current grasp models perform poorly on unseen objects, negatively affecting users' independence and quality of life.
  To address this: (i) we define semantic projection, the ability of a model to generalize to unseen object types and show that conventional models like YOLO, despite 80% training accuracy, drop to 15% on unseen objects. (ii) we propose Grasp-LLaVA, a Grasp Vision Language Model enabling human-like reasoning to infer the suitable grasp type estimate based on the object's physical characteristics resulting in a significant 50.2% accuracy over unseen object types compared to 36.7% accuracy of an SOTA grasp estimation model.
  Lastly, to bridge the performance-latency gap, we propose Hybrid Grasp Network (HGN), an edge-cloud deployment infrastructure enabling fast grasp estimation on edge and accurate cloud inference as a fail-safe, effectively expanding the latency vs. accuracy Pareto. HGN with confidence calibration (DC) enables dynamic switching between edge and cloud models, improving semantic projection accuracy by 5.6% (to 42.3%) with 3.5x speedup over the unseen object types. Over a real-world sample mix, it reaches 86% average accuracy (12.2% gain over edge-only), and 2.2x faster inference than Grasp-LLaVA alone.</description>

      <title>Discovering Spatial Correlations between Earth Observations in Global Atmospheric State Estimation by using Adaptive Graph Structure Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to discover spatial correlations between Earth observations and atmospheric states to improve the forecasting accuracy of global atmospheric state estimation, which are usually conducted using conventional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems and is the beginning of weather forecasting. NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations, which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and newly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding meteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make spatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However, structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by using real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia. Even in areas with high atmospheric variability, the proposed method outperformed existing STGNN models with and without structure learning.</description>

      <title>GLiClass: Generalist Lightweight Model for Sequence Classification Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification is one of the most widespread tasks in AI applications, serving often as the first step in filtering, sorting, and categorizing data. Since modern AI systems must handle large volumes of input data and early pipeline stages can propagate errors downstream, achieving high efficiency and accuracy is critical. Moreover, classification requirements can change dynamically based on user needs, necessitating models with strong zero-shot capabilities. While generative LLMs have become mainstream for zero-shot classification due to their versatility, they suffer from inconsistent instruction following and computational inefficiency. Cross-encoders, commonly used as rerankers in RAG pipelines, face a different bottleneck: they must process text-label pairs sequentially, significantly reducing efficiency with large label sets. Embedding-based approaches offer good efficiency but struggle with complex scenarios involving logical and semantic constraints. We propose GLiClass, a novel method that adapts the GLiNER architecture for sequence classification tasks. Our approach achieves strong accuracy and efficiency comparable to embedding-based methods, while maintaining the flexibility needed for zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Additionally, we adapted proximal policy optimization (PPO) for multi-label text classification, enabling training classifiers in data-sparse conditions or from human feedback.</description>

      <title>AIS-LLM: A Unified Framework for Maritime Trajectory Prediction, Anomaly Detection, and Collision Risk Assessment with Explainable Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime traffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However, existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent and efficient maritime traffic management.</description>

      <title>MORE-CLEAR: Multimodal Offline Reinforcement learning for Clinical notes Leveraged Enhanced State Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sepsis, a life-threatening inflammatory response to infection, causes organ dysfunction, making early detection and optimal management critical. Previous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sepsis management rely primarily on structured data, such as lab results or vital signs, and on a dearth of a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Offline REinforcement learning for Clinical notes Leveraged Enhanced stAte Representation (MORE-CLEAR) framework for sepsis control in intensive care units. MORE-CLEAR employs pre-trained large-scale language models (LLMs) to facilitate the extraction of rich semantic representations from clinical notes, preserving clinical context and improving patient state representation. Gated fusion and cross-modal attention allow dynamic weight adjustment in the context of time and the effective integration of multimodal data. Extensive cross-validation using two public (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and one private dataset demonstrates that MORE-CLEAR significantly improves estimated survival rate and policy performance compared to single-modal RL approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first to leverage LLM capabilities within a multimodal offline RL for better state representation in medical applications. This approach can potentially expedite the treatment and management of sepsis by enabling reinforcement learning models to propose enhanced actions based on a more comprehensive understanding of patient conditions.</description>

      <title>TAR-TVG: Enhancing VLMs with Timestamp Anchor-Constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions, they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG), a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.</description>

      <title>LoSemB: Logic-Guided Semantic Bridging for Inductive Tool Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tool learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for large language models (LLMs) to solve many real-world tasks. Nonetheless, with the tool repository rapidly expanding, it is impractical to contain all tools within the limited input length of LLMs. To alleviate these issues, researchers have explored incorporating a tool retrieval module to select the most relevant tools or represent tools as unique tokens within LLM parameters. However, most state-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools have been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the real-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently. When dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered during the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues, including the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of similarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes of mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical information from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic Bridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to mine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval without costly retraining. Specifically, LoSemB contains a logic-based embedding alignment module to mitigate distribution shifts and implements a relational augmented retrieval mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of similarity-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoSemB achieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining desirable effectiveness in the transductive setting.</description>

      <title>Energy Consumption in Parallel Neural Network Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for computational resources of training neural networks leads to a concerning growth in energy consumption. While parallelization has enabled upscaling model and dataset sizes and accelerated training, its impact on energy consumption is often overlooked. To close this research gap, we conducted scaling experiments for data-parallel training of two models, ResNet50 and FourCastNet, and evaluated the impact of parallelization parameters, i.e., GPU count, global batch size, and local batch size, on predictive performance, training time, and energy consumption. We show that energy consumption scales approximately linearly with the consumed resources, i.e., GPU hours; however, the respective scaling factor differs substantially between distinct model trainings and hardware, and is systematically influenced by the number of samples and gradient updates per GPU hour. Our results shed light on the complex interplay of scaling up neural network training and can inform future developments towards more sustainable AI research.</description>

      <title>Training-Free ANN-to-SNN Conversion for High-Performance Spiking Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the event-driven paradigm, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising approach for constructing energy-efficient Transformer architectures. Compared to directly trained Spiking Transformers, ANN-to-SNN conversion methods bypass the high training costs. However, existing methods still suffer from notable limitations, failing to effectively handle nonlinear operations in Transformer architectures and requiring additional fine-tuning processes for pre-trained ANNs. To address these issues, we propose a high-performance and training-free ANN-to-SNN conversion framework tailored for Transformer architectures. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-basis Exponential Decay (MBE) neuron, which employs an exponential decay strategy and multi-basis encoding method to efficiently approximate various nonlinear operations. It removes the requirement for weight modifications in pre-trained ANNs. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (CV, NLU, NLG) and mainstream Transformer architectures (ViT, RoBERTa, GPT-2) demonstrate that our method achieves near-lossless conversion accuracy with significantly lower latency. This provides a promising pathway for the efficient and scalable deployment of Spiking Transformers in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model (LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset construction in complex real-world domains.</description>

      <title>CognitiveArm: Enabling Real-Time EEG-Controlled Prosthetic Arm Using Embodied Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient control of prosthetic limbs via non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) requires advanced EEG processing, including pre-filtering, feature extraction, and action prediction, performed in real time on edge AI hardware. Achieving this on resource-constrained devices presents challenges in balancing model complexity, computational efficiency, and latency. We present CognitiveArm, an EEG-driven, brain-controlled prosthetic system implemented on embedded AI hardware, achieving real-time operation without compromising accuracy. The system integrates BrainFlow, an open-source library for EEG data acquisition and streaming, with optimized deep learning (DL) models for precise brain signal classification. Using evolutionary search, we identify Pareto-optimal DL configurations through hyperparameter tuning, optimizer analysis, and window selection, analyzed individually and in ensemble configurations. We apply model compression techniques such as pruning and quantization to optimize models for embedded deployment, balancing efficiency and accuracy. We collected an EEG dataset and designed an annotation pipeline enabling precise labeling of brain signals corresponding to specific intended actions, forming the basis for training our optimized DL models. CognitiveArm also supports voice commands for seamless mode switching, enabling control of the prosthetic arm's 3 degrees of freedom (DoF). Running entirely on embedded hardware, it ensures low latency and real-time responsiveness. A full-scale prototype, interfaced with the OpenBCI UltraCortex Mark IV EEG headset, achieved up to 90% accuracy in classifying three core actions (left, right, idle). Voice integration enables multiplexed, variable movement for everyday tasks (e.g., handshake, cup picking), enhancing real-world performance and demonstrating CognitiveArm's potential for advanced prosthetic control.</description>

      <title>A Rule-Based Approach to Specifying Preferences over Conflicting Facts and Querying Inconsistent Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repair-based semantics have been extensively studied as a means of obtaining meaningful answers to queries posed over inconsistent knowledge bases (KBs). While several works have considered how to exploit a priority relation between facts to select optimal repairs, the question of how to specify such preferences remains largely unaddressed. This motivates us to introduce a declarative rule-based framework for specifying and computing a priority relation between conflicting facts. As the expressed preferences may contain undesirable cycles, we consider the problem of determining when a set of preference rules always yields an acyclic relation, and we also explore a pragmatic approach that extracts an acyclic relation by applying various cycle removal techniques. Towards an end-to-end system for querying inconsistent KBs, we present a preliminary implementation and experimental evaluation of the framework, which employs answer set programming to evaluate the preference rules, apply the desired cycle resolution techniques to obtain a priority relation, and answer queries under prioritized-repair semantics.</description>

      <title>Chimera: Harnessing Multi-Agent LLMs for Automatic Insider Threat Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07745v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insider threats, which can lead to severe losses, remain a major security concern. While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods have shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while publicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient real-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich semantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the first large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with agents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group meetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic organizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP theft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three sensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical institution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via human studies and quantitative analysis, confirming its diversity, realism, and presence of explainable threat patterns. Evaluations of existing ITD methods show an average F1-score of 0.83, which is significantly lower than 0.99 on the CERT dataset, demonstrating ChimeraLog's higher difficulty and utility for advancing ITD research.</description>

      <title>Learning to Align, Aligning to Learn: A Unified Approach for Self-Optimized Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alignment methodologies have emerged as a critical pathway for enhancing language model alignment capabilities. While SFT (supervised fine-tuning) accelerates convergence through direct token-level loss intervention, its efficacy is constrained by offline policy trajectory. In contrast, RL(reinforcement learning) facilitates exploratory policy optimization, but suffers from low sample efficiency and stringent dependency on high-quality base models. To address these dual challenges, we propose GRAO (Group Relative Alignment Optimization), a unified framework that synergizes the respective strengths of SFT and RL through three key innovations: 1) A multi-sample generation strategy enabling comparative quality assessment via reward feedback; 2) A novel Group Direct Alignment Loss formulation leveraging intra-group relative advantage weighting; 3) Reference-aware parameter updates guided by pairwise preference dynamics. Our theoretical analysis establishes GRAO's convergence guarantees and sample efficiency advantages over conventional approaches. Comprehensive evaluations across complex human alignment tasks demonstrate GRAO's superior performance, achieving 57.70\%,17.65\% 7.95\% and 5.18\% relative improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO and GRPO baselines respectively. This work provides both a theoretically grounded alignment framework and empirical evidence for efficient capability evolution in language models.</description>

Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) for graphs achieve impressively high expressive power thanks to very efficient and scalable neural networks. However, these networks contain non-linearities that prevent analytical computation of many standard probabilistic inference queries, i.e., these DGMs are considered \emph{intractable}. While recently proposed Probabilistic Graph Circuits (PGCs) address this issue by enabling \emph{tractable} probabilistic inference, they operate on dense graph representations with $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity for graphs with $n$ nodes and \emph{$m$ edges}. To address this scalability issue, we introduce Sparse PGCs, a new class of tractable generative models that operate directly on sparse graph representation, reducing the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n + m)$, which is particularly beneficial for $m \ll n^2$. In the context of de novo drug design, we empirically demonstrate that SPGCs retain exact inference capabilities, improve memory efficiency and inference speed, and match the performance of intractable DGMs in key metrics.</description>

      <title>UniSVG: A Unified Dataset for Vector Graphic Understanding and Generation with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike bitmap images, scalable vector graphics (SVG) maintain quality when scaled, frequently employed in computer vision and artistic design in the representation of SVG code. In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems, enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent. However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&amp;G) remain significant challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&amp;G. Besides, SVG generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters, suggesting the potential to address SVG U&amp;G tasks within a unified model. To unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&amp;G tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset, benchmark, weights, codes and experiment details on https://ryanlijinke.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that require careful balancing of multiple, often conflicting, objectives, such as informativeness versus conciseness, or helpfulness versus creativity. However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF, optimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that fails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This limitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making multi-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge this gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and computationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In contrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a closed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO approaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the number of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering direct optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is the number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within milliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto stationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least one other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning with its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to the MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a practical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse human values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI deployments.</description>

      <title>PCA-Guided Autoencoding for Structured Dimensionality Reduction in Active Infrared Thermography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Infrared thermography (AIRT) is a widely adopted non-destructive testing (NDT) technique for detecting subsurface anomalies in industrial components. Due to the high dimensionality of AIRT data, current approaches employ non-linear autoencoders (AEs) for dimensionality reduction. However, the latent space learned by AIRT AEs lacks structure, limiting their effectiveness in downstream defect characterization tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a principal component analysis guided (PCA-guided) autoencoding framework for structured dimensionality reduction to capture intricate, non-linear features in thermographic signals while enforcing a structured latent space. A novel loss function, PCA distillation loss, is introduced to guide AIRT AEs to align the latent representation with structured PCA components while capturing the intricate, non-linear patterns in thermographic signals. To evaluate the utility of the learned, structured latent space, we propose a neural network-based evaluation metric that assesses its suitability for defect characterization. Experimental results show that the proposed PCA-guided AE outperforms state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods on PVC, CFRP, and PLA samples in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and neural network-based metrics.</description>

      <title>MIND: A Noise-Adaptive Denoising Framework for Medical Images Integrating Multi-Scale Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The core role of medical images in disease diagnosis makes their quality directly affect the accuracy of clinical judgment. However, due to factors such as low-dose scanning, equipment limitations and imaging artifacts, medical images are often accompanied by non-uniform noise interference, which seriously affects structure recognition and lesion detection. This paper proposes a medical image adaptive denoising model (MI-ND) that integrates multi-scale convolutional and Transformer architecture, introduces a noise level estimator (NLE) and a noise adaptive attention module (NAAB), and realizes channel-spatial attention regulation and cross-modal feature fusion driven by noise perception. Systematic testing is carried out on multimodal public datasets. Experiments show that this method significantly outperforms the comparative methods in image quality indicators such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, and improves the F1 score and ROC-AUC in downstream diagnostic tasks, showing strong prac-tical value and promotional potential. The model has outstanding benefits in structural recovery, diagnostic sensitivity, and cross-modal robustness, and provides an effective solution for medical image enhancement and AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>Architectural Co-Design for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection: Decoupling Representation and Dynamically Fusing Features in CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.</description>

      <title>Auditory Intelligence: Understanding the World Through Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in auditory intelligence has yielded high-performing systems for sound event detection (SED), acoustic scene classification (ASC), automated audio captioning (AAC), and audio question answering (AQA). Yet these tasks remain largely constrained to surface-level recognition-capturing what happened but not why, what it implies, or how it unfolds in context. I propose a conceptual reframing of auditory intelligence as a layered, situated process that encompasses perception, reasoning, and interaction. To instantiate this view, I introduce four cognitively inspired task paradigms-ASPIRE, SODA, AUX, and AUGMENT-those structure auditory understanding across time-frequency pattern captioning, hierarchical event/scene description, causal explanation, and goal-driven interpretation, respectively. Together, these paradigms provide a roadmap toward more generalizable, explainable, and human-aligned auditory intelligence, and are intended to catalyze a broader discussion of what it means for machines to understand sound.</description>

      <title>DETACH: Cross-domain Learning for Long-Horizon Tasks via Mixture of Disentangled Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-Horizon (LH) tasks in Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) are complex multi-step tasks that require continuous planning, sequential decision-making, and extended execution across domains to achieve the final goal. However, existing methods heavily rely on skill chaining by concatenating pre-trained subtasks, with environment observations and self-state tightly coupled, lacking the ability to generalize to new combinations of environments and skills, failing to complete various LH tasks across domains. To solve this problem, this paper presents DETACH, a cross-domain learning framework for LH tasks via biologically inspired dual-stream disentanglement. Inspired by the brain's "where-what" dual pathway mechanism, DETACH comprises two core modules: i) an environment learning module for spatial understanding, which captures object functions, spatial relationships, and scene semantics, achieving cross-domain transfer through complete environment-self disentanglement; ii) a skill learning module for task execution, which processes self-state information including joint degrees of freedom and motor patterns, enabling cross-skill transfer through independent motor pattern encoding. We conducted extensive experiments on various LH tasks in HSI scenes. Compared with existing methods, DETACH can achieve an average subtasks success rate improvement of 23% and average execution efficiency improvement of 29%.</description>

      <title>Deep Space Weather Model: Long-Range Solar Flare Prediction from Multi-Wavelength Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand, end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal dependencies in solar images. In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather Model (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information. Furthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare prediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our method. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert performance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability.

      <description>arXiv:2508.07852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research on learnable neural representations has been widely adopted in the field of 3D scene reconstruction and neural rendering applications. However, traditional feature grid representations often suffer from substantial memory footprint, posing a significant bottleneck for modern parallel computing hardware. In this paper, we present neural vertex features, a generalized formulation of learnable representation for neural rendering tasks involving explicit mesh surfaces. Instead of uniformly distributing neural features throughout 3D space, our method stores learnable features directly at mesh vertices, leveraging the underlying geometry as a compact and structured representation for neural processing. This not only optimizes memory efficiency, but also improves feature representation by aligning compactly with the surface using task-specific geometric priors. We validate our neural representation across diverse neural rendering tasks, with a specific emphasis on neural radiosity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces memory consumption to only one-fifth (or even less) of grid-based representations, while maintaining comparable rendering quality and lowering inference overhead.</description>

      <title>Towards Human-AI Collaboration System for the Detection of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in Histopathology Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer, and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates by guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and efficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop (HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images. The system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance EfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature, with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising direction for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Selective Contrastive Learning for Weakly Supervised Affordance Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facilitating an entity's interaction with objects requires accurately identifying parts that afford specific actions. Weakly supervised affordance grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific patterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by leveraging CLIP. Then, by cross-referencing the discovered objects of complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in each perspective. By consistently learning to distinguish affordance-relevant regions from affordance-irrelevant background context, our approach effectively shifts activation from irrelevant areas toward meaningful affordance cues. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are available at github.com/hynnsk/SelectiveCL.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced AI-driven perception system for autonomous quadcopter navigation in GPS-denied indoor environments. The proposed framework leverages cloud computing to offload computationally intensive tasks and incorporates a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) for efficient sensor data acquisition, enabling robust navigation in confined spaces. The system integrates YOLOv11 for object detection, Depth Anything V2 for monocular depth estimation, a PCB equipped with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded architecture achieves low-latency processing. Enhanced spatial awareness is facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object detection achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.6, depth estimation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42 trials over approximately 11 minutes, and end-to-end system latency below 1 second. This cloud-supported, high-intelligence framework serves as an auxiliary perception and navigation system, complementing state-of-the-art drone autonomy for GPS-denied confined spaces.</description>

      <title>Not Yet AlphaFold for the Mind: Evaluating Centaur as a Synthetic Participant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulators have revolutionized scientific practice across the natural sciences. By generating data that reliably approximate real-world phenomena, they enable scientists to accelerate hypothesis testing and optimize experimental designs. This is perhaps best illustrated by AlphaFold, a Nobel-prize winning simulator in chemistry that predicts protein structures from amino acid sequences, enabling rapid prototyping of molecular interactions, drug targets, and protein functions. In the behavioral sciences, a reliable participant simulator - a system capable of producing human-like behavior across cognitive tasks - would represent a similarly transformative advance. Recently, Binz et al. introduced Centaur, a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on human data from 160 experiments, proposing its use not only as a model of cognition but also as a participant simulator for "in silico prototyping of experimental studies", e.g., to advance automated cognitive science. Here, we review the core criteria for a participant simulator and assess how well Centaur meets them. Although Centaur demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, its generative behavior - a critical criterion for a participant simulator - systematically diverges from human data. This suggests that, while Centaur is a significant step toward predicting human behavior, it does not yet meet the standards of a reliable participant simulator or an accurate model of cognition.</description>

Abstract: Computer vision-based technologies significantly enhance surgical automation by advancing tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, Current data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios. Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality. Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.</description>

      <title>Diffusing the Blind Spot: Uterine MRI Synthesis with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images, limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.</description>

      <title>SCDF: A Speaker Characteristics DeepFake Speech Dataset for Bias Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite growing attention to deepfake speech detection, the aspects of bias and fairness remain underexplored in the speech domain. To address this gap, we introduce the Speaker Characteristics Deepfake (SCDF) dataset: a novel, richly annotated resource enabling systematic evaluation of demographic biases in deepfake speech detection. SCDF contains over 237,000 utterances in a balanced representation of both male and female speakers spanning five languages and a wide age range. We evaluate several state-of-the-art detectors and show that speaker characteristics significantly influence detection performance, revealing disparities across sex, language, age, and synthesizer type. These findings highlight the need for bias-aware development and provide a foundation for building non-discriminatory deepfake detection systems aligned with ethical and regulatory standards.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Challenges and Opportunities of AI-assisted Codebase Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent AI code assistants have significantly improved their ability to process more complex contexts and generate entire codebases based on a textual description, compared to the popular snippet-level generation. These codebase AI assistants (CBAs) can also extend or adapt codebases, allowing users to focus on higher-level design and deployment decisions. While prior work has extensively studied the impact of snippet-level code generation, this new class of codebase generation models is relatively unexplored. Despite initial anecdotal reports of excitement about these agents, they remain less frequently adopted compared to snippet-level code assistants. To utilize CBAs better, we need to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall short of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a counterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers working on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the information in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts), required functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and their prompt writing process. Despite various strategies, the overall satisfaction score with generated codebases remained low (mean = 2.8, median = 3, on a scale of one to five). Participants mentioned functionality as the most common factor for dissatisfaction (77% of instances), alongside poor code quality (42% of instances) and communication issues (25% of instances). We delve deeper into participants' dissatisfaction to identify six underlying challenges that participants faced when using CBAs, and extracted five barriers to incorporating CBAs into their workflows. Finally, we surveyed 21 commercial CBAs to compare their capabilities with participant challenges and present design opportunities for more efficient and useful CBAs.</description>

      <title>WeChat-YATT: A Simple, Scalable and Balanced RLHF Trainer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for training large language models and multimodal systems. Despite notable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant challenges remain in scaling to complex multimodal workflows and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations related to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as inefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper, we introduce WeChat-YATT (Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat), a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address these challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model that enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows, effectively mitigating the bottlenecks associated with centralized controller architectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In addition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions computational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training conditions. We evaluate WeChat-YATT across a range of experimental scenarios, demonstrating that it achieves substantial improvements in throughput compared to state-of-the-art RLHF training frameworks. Furthermore, WeChat-YATT has been successfully deployed to train models supporting WeChat product features for a large-scale user base, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond Ten Turns: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agentic Search with Large-Scale Asynchronous RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. &lt;=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.</description>

      <title>Omni-Effects: Unified and Spatially-Controllable Visual Effects Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07981v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges, we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts (LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference. (2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of desired effects.</description>

      <title>DIVER: A Multi-Stage Approach for Reasoning-intensive Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07995v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has achieved strong performance on knowledge-intensive tasks where query-document relevance can be identified through direct lexical or semantic matches. However, many real-world queries involve abstract reasoning, analogical thinking, or multi-step inference, which existing retrievers often struggle to capture. To address this challenge, we present \textbf{DIVER}, a retrieval pipeline tailored for reasoning-intensive information retrieval. DIVER consists of four components: document processing to improve input quality, LLM-driven query expansion via iterative document interaction, a reasoning-enhanced retriever fine-tuned on synthetic multi-domain data with hard negatives, and a pointwise reranker that combines LLM-assigned helpfulness scores with retrieval scores. On the BRIGHT benchmark, DIVER achieves state-of-the-art nDCG@10 scores of 41.6 and 28.9 on original queries, consistently outperforming competitive reasoning-aware models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware retrieval strategies in complex real-world tasks. Our code and retrieval model will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Learning to Select MCP Algorithms: From Traditional ML to Dual-Channel GAT-MLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive experiments and prior studies show that no single maximum clique algorithm consistently performs best across all instances, highlighting the importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on instance features. Through an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline. In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.</description>

      <title>Advancing Knowledge Tracing by Exploring Follow-up Performance Trends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), such as Massive Open Online Courses, offer new opportunities for human learning. At the core of such systems, knowledge tracing (KT) predicts students' future performance by analyzing their historical learning activities, enabling an accurate evaluation of students' knowledge states over time. We show that existing KT methods often encounter correlation conflicts when analyzing the relationships between historical learning sequences and future performance. To address such conflicts, we propose to extract so-called Follow-up Performance Trends (FPTs) from historical ITS data and to incorporate them into KT. We propose a method called Forward-Looking Knowledge Tracing (FINER) that combines historical learning sequences with FPTs to enhance student performance prediction accuracy. FINER constructs learning patterns that facilitate the retrieval of FPTs from historical ITS data in linear time; FINER includes a novel similarity-aware attention mechanism that aggregates FPTs based on both frequency and contextual similarity; and FINER offers means of combining FPTs and historical learning sequences to enable more accurate prediction of student future performance. Experiments on six real-world datasets show that FINER can outperform ten state-of-the-art KT methods, increasing accuracy by 8.74% to 84.85%.</description>

Abstract: Speech Recognition (ASR) due to phoneme distortions and high variability. While self-supervised ASR models like Wav2Vec, HuBERT, and Whisper have shown promise, their effectiveness in dysarthric speech remains unclear. This study systematically benchmarks these models with different decoding strategies, including CTC, seq2seq, and LLM-enhanced decoding (BART,GPT-2, Vicuna). Our contributions include (1) benchmarking ASR architectures for dysarthric speech, (2) introducing LLM-based decoding to improve intelligibility, (3) analyzing generalization across datasets, and (4) providing insights into recognition errors across severity levels. Findings highlight that LLM-enhanced decoding improves dysarthric ASR by leveraging linguistic constraints for phoneme restoration and grammatical correction.</description>

      <title>Exploring Strategies for Personalized Radiation Therapy: Part III Identifying genetic determinants for Radiation Response with Meta Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation response in cancer is shaped by complex, patient specific biology, yet current treatment strategies often rely on uniform dose prescriptions without accounting for tumor heterogeneity. In this study, we introduce a meta learning framework for one-shot prediction of radiosensitivity measured by SF2 using cell line level gene expression data. Unlike the widely used Radiosensitivity Index RSI a rank-based linear model trained on a fixed 10-gene signature, our proposed meta-learned model allows the importance of each gene to vary by sample through fine tuning. This flexibility addresses key limitations of static models like RSI, which assume uniform gene contributions across tumor types and discard expression magnitude and gene gene interactions. Our results show that meta learning offers robust generalization to unseen samples and performs well in tumor subgroups with high radiosensitivity variability, such as adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. By learning transferable structure across tasks while preserving sample specific adaptability, our approach enables rapid adaptation to individual samples, improving predictive accuracy across diverse tumor subtypes while uncovering context dependent patterns of gene influence that may inform personalized therapy.</description>

      <title>BadPromptFL: A Novel Backdoor Threat to Prompt-based Federated Learning in Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt-based tuning has emerged as a lightweight alternative to full fine-tuning in large vision-language models, enabling efficient adaptation via learned contextual prompts. This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(&gt;90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Adaptive Mixture of Experts for Cold-start Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems have faced significant challenges in cold-start scenarios, where new items with a limited history of interaction need to be effectively recommended to users. Though multimodal data (e.g., images, text, audio, etc.) offer rich information to address this issue, existing approaches often employ simplistic integration methods such as concatenation, average pooling, or fixed weighting schemes, which fail to capture the complex relationships between modalities. Our study proposes a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework for multimodal cold-start recommendation, named MAMEX, which dynamically leverages latent representation from different modalities. MAMEX utilizes modality-specific expert networks and introduces a learnable gating mechanism that adaptively weights the contribution of each modality based on its content characteristics. This approach enables MAMEX to emphasize the most informative modalities for each item while maintaining robustness when certain modalities are less relevant or missing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MAMEX outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cold-start scenarios, with superior accuracy and adaptability. For reproducibility, the code has been made available on Github https://github.com/L2R-UET/MAMEX.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Self-Replication: Detecting Distributed Selfhood in the Outlier Cellular Automaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous self-replication in cellular automata has long been considered rare, with most known examples requiring careful design or artificial initialization. In this paper, we present formal, causal evidence that such replication can emerge unassisted -- and that it can do so in a distributed, multi-component form. Building on prior work identifying complex dynamics in the Outlier rule, we introduce a data-driven framework that reconstructs the full causal ancestry of patterns in a deterministic cellular automaton. This allows us to rigorously identify self-replicating structures via explicit causal lineages. Our results show definitively that self-replicators in the Outlier CA are not only spontaneous and robust, but are also often composed of multiple disjoint clusters working in coordination, raising questions about some conventional notions of individuality and replication in artificial life systems.</description>

      <title>On Understanding of the Dynamics of Model Capacity in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability-plasticity dilemma, closely related to a neural network's (NN) capacity-its ability to represent tasks-is a fundamental challenge in continual learning (CL). Within this context, we introduce CL's effective model capacity (CLEMC) that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the stability-plasticity balance point. We develop a difference equation to model the evolution of the interplay between the NN, task data, and optimization procedure. We then leverage CLEMC to demonstrate that the effective capacity-and, by extension, the stability-plasticity balance point is inherently non-stationary. We show that regardless of the NN architecture or optimization method, a NN's ability to represent new tasks diminishes when incoming task distributions differ from previous ones. We conduct extensive experiments to support our theoretical findings, spanning a range of architectures-from small feedforward network and convolutional networks to medium-sized graph neural networks and transformer-based large language models with millions of parameters.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Design Space of Visual Grounding in Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6% / +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.</description>

      <title>C-MAG: Cascade Multimodal Attributed Graphs for Supply Chain Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connecting an ever-expanding catalogue of products with suitable manufacturers and suppliers is critical for resilient, efficient global supply chains, yet traditional methods struggle to capture complex capabilities, certifications, geographic constraints, and rich multimodal data of real-world manufacturer profiles. To address these gaps, we introduce PMGraph, a public benchmark of bipartite and heterogeneous multimodal supply-chain graphs linking 8,888 manufacturers, over 70k products, more than 110k manufacturer-product edges, and over 29k product images. Building on this benchmark, we propose the Cascade Multimodal Attributed Graph C-MAG, a two-stage architecture that first aligns and aggregates textual and visual attributes into intermediate group embeddings, then propagates them through a manufacturer-product hetero-graph via multiscale message passing to enhance link prediction accuracy. C-MAG also provides practical guidelines for modality-aware fusion, preserving predictive performance in noisy, real-world settings.</description>

      <title>HierSearch: A Hierarchical Enterprise Deep Search Framework Integrating Local and Web Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and coding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in challenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are generally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web. However, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can leverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an agent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning (RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data efficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we propose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with hierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep search agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains. At the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides the final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error propagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and irrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that HierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms various deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines in six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.</description>

      <title>Growing Reservoirs with Developmental Graph Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developmental Graph Cellular Automata (DGCA) are a novel model for morphogenesis, capable of growing directed graphs from single-node seeds. In this paper, we show that DGCAs can be trained to grow reservoirs. Reservoirs are grown with two types of targets: task-driven (using the NARMA family of tasks) and task-independent (using reservoir metrics).
  Results show that DGCAs are able to grow into a variety of specialized, life-like structures capable of effectively solving benchmark tasks, statistically outperforming `typical' reservoirs on the same task. Overall, these lay the foundation for the development of DGCA systems that produce plastic reservoirs and for modeling functional, adaptive morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Dual Information Speech Language Models for Emotional Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs) often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information within contextual settings.</description>

      <title>Grid2Guide: A* Enabled Small Language Model for Indoor Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable indoor navigation remains a significant challenge in complex environments, particularly where external positioning signals and dedicated infrastructures are unavailable. This research presents Grid2Guide, a hybrid navigation framework that combines the A* search algorithm with a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate clear, human-readable route instructions. The framework first conducts a binary occupancy matrix from a given indoor map. Using this matrix, the A* algorithm computes the optimal path between origin and destination, producing concise textual navigation steps. These steps are then transformed into natural language instructions by the SLM, enhancing interpretability for end users. Experimental evaluations across various indoor scenarios demonstrate the method's effectiveness in producing accurate and timely navigation guidance. The results validate the proposed approach as a lightweight, infrastructure-free solution for real-time indoor navigation support.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT on the Road: Leveraging Large Language Model-Powered In-vehicle Conversational Agents for Safer and More Enjoyable Driving Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies on in-vehicle conversational agents have traditionally relied on pre-scripted prompts or limited voice commands, constraining natural driver-agent interaction. To resolve this issue, the present study explored the potential of a ChatGPT-based in-vehicle agent capable of carrying continuous, multi-turn dialogues. Forty drivers participated in our experiment using a motion-based driving simulator, comparing three conditions (No agent, Pre-scripted agent, and ChatGPT-based agent) as a within-subjects variable. Results showed that the ChatGPT-based agent condition led to more stable driving performance across multiple metrics. Participants demonstrated lower variability in longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, and lane deviation compared to the other two conditions. In subjective evaluations, the ChatGPT-based agent also received significantly higher ratings in competence, animacy, affective trust, and preference compared to the Pre-scripted agent. Our thematic analysis of driver-agent conversations revealed diverse interaction patterns in topics, including driving assistance/questions, entertainment requests, and anthropomorphic interactions. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-powered in-vehicle conversational agents to enhance driving safety and user experience through natural, context-rich interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an advanced sensing modality that simultaneously captures spatial and spectral information, enabling non-invasive, label-free analysis of material, chemical, and biological properties. This Primer presents a comprehensive overview of HSI, from the underlying physical principles and sensor architectures to key steps in data acquisition, calibration, and correction. We summarize common data structures and highlight classical and modern analysis methods, including dimensionality reduction, classification, spectral unmixing, and AI-driven techniques such as deep learning. Representative applications across Earth observation, precision agriculture, biomedicine, industrial inspection, cultural heritage, and security are also discussed, emphasizing HSI's ability to uncover sub-visual features for advanced monitoring, diagnostics, and decision-making. Persistent challenges, such as hardware trade-offs, acquisition variability, and the complexity of high-dimensional data, are examined alongside emerging solutions, including computational imaging, physics-informed modeling, cross-modal fusion, and self-supervised learning. Best practices for dataset sharing, reproducibility, and metadata documentation are further highlighted to support transparency and reuse. Looking ahead, we explore future directions toward scalable, real-time, and embedded HSI systems, driven by sensor miniaturization, self-supervised learning, and foundation models. As HSI evolves into a general-purpose, cross-disciplinary platform, it holds promise for transformative applications in science, technology, and society.</description>

      <title>GRASPTrack: Geometry-Reasoned Association via Segmentation and Projection for Multi-Object Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation. Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance, significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent occlusions and intricate motion patterns.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Localization and LLM-based Navigation for Indoor Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor navigation remains a complex challenge due to the absence of reliable GPS signals and the architectural intricacies of large enclosed environments. This study presents an indoor localization and navigation approach that integrates vision-based localization with large language model (LLM)-based navigation. The localization system utilizes a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network fine-tuned through a two-stage process to identify the user's position using smartphone camera input. To complement localization, the navigation module employs an LLM, guided by a carefully crafted system prompt, to interpret preprocessed floor plan images and generate step-by-step directions. Experimental evaluation was conducted in a realistic office corridor with repetitive features and limited visibility to test localization robustness. The model achieved high confidence and an accuracy of 96% across all tested waypoints, even under constrained viewing conditions and short-duration queries. Navigation tests using ChatGPT on real building floor maps yielded an average instruction accuracy of 75%, with observed limitations in zero-shot reasoning and inference time. This research demonstrates the potential for scalable, infrastructure-free indoor navigation using off-the-shelf cameras and publicly available floor plans, particularly in resource-constrained settings like hospitals, airports, and educational institutions.</description>

      <title>MemoryKT: An Integrative Memory-and-Forgetting Method for Knowledge Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is committed to capturing students' knowledge mastery from their historical interactions. Simulating students' memory states is a promising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of knowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests during the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single, undifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as well as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes memoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational autoencoder. The model simulates memory dynamics through a three-stage process: (i) Learning the distribution of students' knowledge memory features, (ii) Reconstructing their exercise feedback, while (iii) Embedding a personalized forgetting module within the temporal workflow to dynamically modulate memory storage strength. This jointly models the complete encoding-storage-retrieval cycle, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for individual differences. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport Regularization for Speech Text Alignment in Spoken Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs), which extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive speech inputs, have gained increasing attention for their potential to advance speech understanding tasks. However, despite recent progress, studies show that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained languages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a text-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the modality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in speech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by exploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization. To mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization (OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport problem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each training iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between speech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan, then incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to optimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with transcript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or learnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training procedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg enhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently improves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>MuaLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model Agent for Circuit Design Assistance with Hybrid Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research, inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason + Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant, capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools, automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates. Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation, overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8% accuracy on Reas-100.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Detect Their Confabulations? Estimating Reliability in Uncertainty-Aware Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks, we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.</description>

      <title>COMponent-Aware Pruning for Accelerated Control Tasks in Latent Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of resource-constrained mobile platforms, including mobile robots, wearable systems, and Internet-of-Things devices, has increased the demand for computationally efficient neural network controllers (NNCs) that can operate within strict hardware limitations. While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of AI-based decision support systems, explanations can help users to judge when to trust the AI's suggestion, and when to question it. In this way, human oversight can prevent AI errors and biased decision-making. However, this rests on the assumption that users will consider explanations in enough detail to be able to catch such errors. We conducted an online study on trust in explainable DSS, and were surprised to find that in many cases, participants spent little time on the explanation and did not always consider it in detail. We present an exploratory analysis of this data, investigating what factors impact how carefully study participants consider AI explanations, and how this in turn impacts whether they are open to changing their mind based on what the AI suggests.</description>

      <title>LPI-RIT at LeWiDi-2025: Improving Distributional Predictions via Metadata and Loss Reweighting with DisCo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) 2025 shared task is to model annotator disagreement through soft label distribution prediction and perspectivist evaluation, modeling annotators. We adapt DisCo (Distribution from Context), a neural architecture that jointly models item-level and annotator-level label distributions, and present detailed analysis and improvements. In this paper, we extend the DisCo by incorporating annotator metadata, enhancing input representations, and modifying the loss functions to capture disagreement patterns better. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate substantial improvements in both soft and perspectivist evaluation metrics across three datasets. We also conduct in-depth error and calibration analyses, highlighting the conditions under which improvements occur. Our findings underscore the value of disagreement-aware modeling and offer insights into how system components interact with the complexity of human-annotated data.</description>

      <title>PyVeritas: On Verifying Python via LLM-Based Transpilation and Bounded Model Checking for C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet it lacks robust tools for formal verification. In contrast, programmers working in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC, which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the applicability of formal verification to Python programs.
  In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated C code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance, but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use. We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules in tabular classification, notably on an example from the medical field where interpretability has tangible value.</description>

      <title>MedReasoner: Reinforcement Learning Drives Reasoning Grounding from Clinical Thought to Pixel-Level Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15 super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential to human health, and their precise morphological analysis is important for diagnosing hematological disorders. Despite the promise of foundation models in medical diagnostics, comprehensive AI solutions for RBC analysis remain scarce. We present RedDino, a self-supervised foundation model designed for RBC image analysis. RedDino uses an RBC-specific adaptation of the DINOv2 self-supervised learning framework and is trained on a curated dataset of 1.25 million RBC images from diverse acquisition modalities and sources. Extensive evaluations show that RedDino outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on RBC shape classification. Through assessments including linear probing and nearest neighbor classification, we confirm its strong feature representations and generalization ability. Our main contributions are: (1) a foundation model tailored for RBC analysis, (2) ablation studies exploring DINOv2 configurations for RBC modeling, and (3) a detailed evaluation of generalization performance. RedDino addresses key challenges in computational hematology by capturing nuanced morphological features, advancing the development of reliable diagnostic tools. The source code and pretrained models for RedDino are available at https://github.com/Snarci/RedDino, and the pretrained models can be downloaded from our Hugging Face collection at https://huggingface.co/collections/Snarcy/reddino-689a13e29241d2e5690202fc</description>

      <title>Street-Level AI: Are Large Language Models Ready for Real-World Judgments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A surge of recent work explores the ethical and societal implications of large-scale AI models that make "moral" judgments. Much of this literature focuses either on alignment with human judgments through various thought experiments or on the group fairness implications of AI judgments. However, the most immediate and likely use of AI is to help or fully replace the so-called street-level bureaucrats, the individuals deciding to allocate scarce social resources or approve benefits. There is a rich history underlying how principles of local justice determine how society decides on prioritization mechanisms in such domains. In this paper, we examine how well LLM judgments align with human judgments, as well as with socially and politically determined vulnerability scoring systems currently used in the domain of homelessness resource allocation. Crucially, we use real data on those needing services (maintaining strict confidentiality by only using local large models) to perform our analyses. We find that LLM prioritizations are extremely inconsistent in several ways: internally on different runs, between different LLMs, and between LLMs and the vulnerability scoring systems. At the same time, LLMs demonstrate qualitative consistency with lay human judgments in pairwise testing. Findings call into question the readiness of current generation AI systems for naive integration in high-stakes societal decision-making.</description>

      <title>Human-Alignment and Calibration of Inference-Time Uncertainty in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in evaluating large language models for uncertainty calibration to facilitate model control and modulate user trust. Inference time uncertainty, which may provide a real-time signal to the model or external control modules, is particularly important for applying these concepts to improve LLM-user experience in practice. While many of the existing papers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to evaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this work, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using both established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they align with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model calibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment to human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer preference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence of model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and distributional analysis.</description>

      <title>SAEMark: Multi-bit LLM Watermarking with Inference-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality, require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content attribution.</description>

      <title>Multi-head Transformers Provably Learn Symbolic Multi-step Reasoning via Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step reasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks: a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise require deeper architectures.</description>

      <title>Capabilities of GPT-5 on Multimodal Medical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives, structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and understanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain, recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.</description>

      <title>OMGSR: You Only Need One Mid-timestep Guidance for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM) generative models show promising potential for one-step Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep, incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants: OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a 1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our two-stage Tiled VAE &amp; Diffusion.</description>

      <title>LL3M: Large Language 3D Modelers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python code in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns from a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration with artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse, unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or procedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material edits, and user-driven refinements. Our experiments showcase the power of code as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation. Our project page is at https://threedle.github.io/ll3m.</description>

      <title>VGGSounder: Audio-Visual Evaluations for Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of audio-visual foundation models underscores the importance of reliably assessing their multi-modal understanding. The VGGSounder dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification. However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSounder, including incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities. These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion metric.</description>

      <title>Cut2Next: Generating Next Shot via In-Context Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08244v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation (NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity. Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically coherent subsequent shots.</description>

      <title>Sortability of Time Series Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the performance of causal discovery algorithms that aim to find causal relationships between time-dependent processes remains a challenging topic. In this paper, we show that certain characteristics of datasets, such as varsortability (Reisach et al. 2021) and $R^2$-sortability (Reisach et al. 2023), also occur in datasets for autocorrelated stationary time series. We illustrate this empirically using four types of data: simulated data based on SVAR models and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, the data used in the 2019 causality-for-climate challenge (Runge et al. 2019), real-world river stream datasets, and real-world data generated by the Causal Chamber of (Gamella et al. 2024). To do this, we adapt var- and $R^2$-sortability to time series data. We also investigate the extent to which the performance of score-based causal discovery methods goes hand in hand with high sortability. Arguably, our most surprising finding is that the investigated real-world datasets exhibit high varsortability and low $R^2$-sortability indicating that scales may carry a significant amount of causal information.</description>

      <title>Learning How to Vote with Principles: Axiomatic Insights Into the Collective Decisions of Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can neural networks be applied in voting theory, while satisfying the need for transparency in collective decisions? We propose axiomatic deep voting: a framework to build and evaluate neural networks that aggregate preferences, using the well-established axiomatic method of voting theory. Our findings are: (1) Neural networks, despite being highly accurate, often fail to align with the core axioms of voting rules, revealing a disconnect between mimicking outcomes and reasoning. (2) Training with axiom-specific data does not enhance alignment with those axioms. (3) By solely optimizing axiom satisfaction, neural networks can synthesize new voting rules that often surpass and substantially differ from existing ones. This offers insights for both fields: For AI, important concepts like bias and value-alignment are studied in a mathematically rigorous way; for voting theory, new areas of the space of voting rules are explored.</description>

      <title>Graph-Powered Defense: Controller Area Network Intrusion Detection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The network of services, including delivery, farming, and environmental monitoring, has experienced exponential expansion in the past decade with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Yet, UAVs are not robust enough against cyberattacks, especially on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. The CAN bus is a general-purpose vehicle-bus standard to enable microcontrollers and in-vehicle computers to interact, primarily connecting different Electronic Control Units (ECUs). In this study, we focus on solving some of the most critical security weaknesses in UAVs by developing a novel graph-based intrusion detection system (IDS) leveraging the Uncomplicated Application-level Vehicular Communication and Networking (UAVCAN) protocol. First, we decode CAN messages based on UAVCAN protocol specification; second, we present a comprehensive method of transforming tabular UAVCAN messages into graph structures. Lastly, we apply various graph-based machine learning models for detecting cyber-attacks on the CAN bus, including graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs), graph attention networks (GATs), Graph Sample and Aggregate Networks (GraphSAGE), and graph structure-based transformers. Our findings show that inductive models such as GATs, GraphSAGE, and graph-based transformers can achieve competitive and even better accuracy than transductive models like GCNNs in detecting various types of intrusions, with minimum information on protocol specification, thus providing a generic robust solution for CAN bus security for the UAVs. We also compared our results with baseline single-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and found that all our graph-based models perform better without using any decoded features based on the UAVCAN protocol, highlighting higher detection performance with protocol-independent capability.</description>

      <title>A Research Agenda for Usability and Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is common practice in reinforcement learning (RL) research to train and deploy agents in bespoke simulators, typically implemented by engineers directly in general-purpose programming languages or hardware acceleration frameworks such as CUDA or JAX. This means that programming and engineering expertise is not only required to develop RL algorithms, but is also required to use already developed algorithms for novel problems. The latter poses a problem in terms of the usability of RL, in particular for private individuals and small organisations without substantial engineering expertise. We also perceive this as a challenge for effective generalisation in RL, in the sense that is no standard, shared formalism in which different problems are represented. As we typically have no consistent representation through which to provide information about any novel problem to an agent, our agents also cannot instantly or rapidly generalise to novel problems. In this position paper, we advocate for a research agenda centred around the use of user-friendly description languages for describing problems, such that (i) users with little to no engineering expertise can formally describe the problems they would like to be tackled by RL algorithms, and (ii) algorithms can leverage problem descriptions to effectively generalise among all problems describable in the language of choice.</description>

      <title>D-Judge: How Far Are We? Assessing the Discrepancies Between AI-synthesized and Natural Images through Multimodal Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17632v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), a central challenge is distinguishing AI-synthesized images from natural ones. Despite the impressive capabilities of advanced generative models in producing visually compelling images, significant discrepancies remain when compared to natural images. To systematically investigate and quantify these differences, we construct a large-scale multimodal dataset, D-ANI, comprising 5,000 natural images and over 440,000 AIGI samples generated by nine representative models using both unimodal and multimodal prompts, including Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Image (I2I), and Text-and-Image-to-Image (TI2I). We then introduce an AI-Natural Image Discrepancy assessment benchmark (D-Judge) to address the critical question: how far are AI-generated images (AIGIs) from truly realistic images? Our fine-grained evaluation framework assesses the D-ANI dataset across five dimensions: naive visual quality, semantic alignment, aesthetic appeal, downstream task applicability, and coordinated human validation. Extensive experiments reveal substantial discrepancies across these dimensions, highlighting the importance of aligning quantitative metrics with human judgment to achieve a comprehensive understanding of AI-generated image quality.

      <title>Observation Interference in Partially Observable Assistance Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study partially observable assistance games (POAGs), a model of the human-AI value alignment problem which allows the human and the AI assistant to have partial observations. Motivated by concerns of AI deception, we study a qualitatively new phenomenon made possible by partial observability: would an AI assistant ever have an incentive to interfere with the human's observations? First, we prove that sometimes an optimal assistant must take observation-interfering actions, even when the human is playing optimally, and even when there are otherwise-equivalent actions available that do not interfere with observations. Though this result seems to contradict the classic theorem from single-agent decision making that the value of information is nonnegative, we resolve this seeming contradiction by developing a notion of interference defined on entire policies. This can be viewed as an extension of the classic result that the value of information is nonnegative into the cooperative multiagent setting. Second, we prove that if the human is simply making decisions based on their immediate outcomes, the assistant might need to interfere with observations as a way to query the human's preferences. We show that this incentive for interference goes away if the human is playing optimally, or if we introduce a communication channel for the human to communicate their preferences to the assistant. Third, we show that if the human acts according to the Boltzmann model of irrationality, this can create an incentive for the assistant to interfere with observations. Finally, we use an experimental model to analyze tradeoffs faced by the AI assistant in practice when considering whether or not to take observation-interfering actions.</description>

      <title>Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09368v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction tuning enhances large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions across diverse tasks, relying on high-quality datasets to guide behavior. However, these datasets, whether manually curated or synthetically generated, are often narrowly focused and misaligned with the broad distributions captured during pre-training, limiting LLM generalization and effective use of pre-trained knowledge. We propose Aligning Instruction Tuning with Pre-training (AITP), a method that bridges this gap by identifying coverage shortfalls in instruction-tuning datasets and rewriting underrepresented pre-training data into high-quality instruction-response pairs. This approach enriches dataset diversity while preserving task-specific objectives. Evaluations on three fully open LLMs across eight benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements with AITP. Ablations highlight the benefits of adaptive data selection, controlled rewriting, and balanced integration, emphasizing the importance of aligning instruction tuning with pre-training distributions to unlock the full potential of LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Differentiated Reward Method for Reinforcement Learning based Multi-Vehicle Cooperative Decision-Making Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) shows great potential for optimizing multi-vehicle cooperative driving strategies through the state-action-reward feedback loop, but it still faces challenges such as low sample efficiency. This paper proposes a differentiated reward method based on steady-state transition systems, which incorporates state transition gradient information into the reward design by analyzing traffic flow characteristics, aiming to optimize action selection and policy learning in multi-vehicle cooperative decision-making. The performance of the proposed method is validated in RL algorithms such as MAPPO, MADQN, and QMIX under varying autonomous vehicle penetration. The results show that the differentiated reward method significantly accelerates training convergence and outperforms centering reward and others in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, and action rationality. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong scalability and environmental adaptability, providing a novel approach for multi-agent cooperative decision-making in complex traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Meta-Reasoner: Dynamic Guidance for Optimized Inference-time Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19918v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with high computational time and error propagation during inference time, especially for complex tasks like math, puzzles, or coding requiring multi-step thinking. While existing reasoning models with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) can enable LLMs to do step-wise analysis and reflection, they often face the issue of wasting computation on less productive solutions and fail to make progress during inference time. In this paper, we propose Meta-Reasoner, a new framework to enable LLMs ``Think about how to think'', i.e., optimize the inference compute by adjusting strategies on how to reason during inference time. Inspired by dual-process theory, our method decouples the high-level strategy generation (e.g., backtracking, switching approaches, or restarting) from stepwise CoT generation via a lightweight progress report. The strategy module only consider the summarized version from the previous CoTs to propose new strategies accordingly. We employ the contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs) for this module to iteratively evaluate the previous reasoning states and dynamically adjust the strategy to avoid reasoning get stuck in less productive paths during inference. Evaluations on math problems (e.g., Game-of-24, TheoremQA) and scientific problems (e.g., SciBench) demonstrate that our method improves performance by 9-12\% over previous SOTA methods while reducing inference time by 28-35\%. This approach also generalizes to other domains like creative writing, demonstrating its versatility for diverse reasoning-intensive problems using LLMs.</description>

      <title>Reviewing Clinical Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models: Training and Beyond</title>

Abstract: The large-scale development of large language models (LLMs) in medical contexts, such as diagnostic assistance and treatment recommendations, necessitates that these models possess accurate medical knowledge and deliver traceable decision-making processes. Clinical knowledge, encompassing the insights gained from research on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, has been extensively examined within real-world medical practices. Recently, there has been a notable increase in research efforts aimed at integrating this type of knowledge into LLMs, encompassing not only traditional text and multimodal data integration but also technologies such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we review the various initiatives to embed clinical knowledge into training-based, KG-supported, and RAG-assisted LLMs. We begin by gathering reliable knowledge sources from the medical domain, including databases and datasets. Next, we evaluate implementations for integrating clinical knowledge through specialized datasets and collaborations with external knowledge sources such as KGs and relevant documentation. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of the developed medical LLMs in the industrial sector to assess the disparity between models developed in academic settings and those in industry. We conclude the survey by presenting evaluation systems applicable to relevant tasks and identifying potential challenges facing this field. In this review, we do not aim for completeness, since any ostensibly complete review would soon be outdated. Our goal is to illustrate diversity by selecting representative and accessible items from current research and industry practices, reflecting real-world situations rather than claiming completeness. Thus, we emphasize showcasing diverse approaches.</description>

      <title>Instructor-Worker Large Language Model System for Policy Recommendation: a Case Study on Air Quality Analysis of the January 2025 Los Angeles Wildfires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.</description>

      <title>A Planning Compilation to Reason about Goal Achievement at Planning Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the specific actions that achieve goals when solving a planning task might be beneficial for various planning applications. Traditionally, this identification occurs post-search, as some actions may temporarily achieve goals that are later undone and re-achieved by other actions. In this paper, we propose a compilation that extends the original planning task with commit actions that enforce the persistence of specific goals once achieved, allowing planners to identify permanent goal achievement during planning. Experimental results indicate that solving the reformulated tasks does not incur on any additional overhead both when performing optimal and suboptimal planning, while providing useful information for some downstream tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational chemistry tools are widely used to study the behaviour of chemical phenomena. Yet, the complexity of these tools can make them inaccessible to non-specialists and challenging even for experts. In this work, we introduce El Agente Q, an LLM-based multi-agent system that dynamically generates and executes quantum chemistry workflows from natural language user prompts. The system is built on a novel cognitive architecture featuring a hierarchical memory framework that enables flexible task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, post-analysis, and autonomous file handling and submission. El Agente Q is benchmarked on six university-level course exercises and two case studies, demonstrating robust problem-solving performance (averaging &gt;87% task success) and adaptive error handling through in situ debugging. It also supports longer-term, multi-step task execution for more complex workflows, while maintaining transparency through detailed action trace logs. Together, these capabilities lay the foundation for increasingly autonomous and accessible quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models on Dynamic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models excel on static benchmarks, but their ability as self-learning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. We evaluate three prompting strategies: self-reflection, heuristic mutation, and planning across dynamic tasks with open-source models. We find that larger models generally outperform smaller ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, an overly long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks, while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops. Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits persistent limitations in areas like planning and spatial coordination, suggesting that large language models still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while methods like Chain-of-thought improve multi-step reasoning on math word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.</description>

      <title>Identification of Probabilities of Causation: A Complete Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilities of causation are fundamental to modern decision-making. Pearl first introduced three binary probabilities of causation, and Tian and Pearl later derived tight bounds for them using Balke's linear programming. The theoretical characterization of probabilities of causation with multi-valued treatments and outcomes has remained unresolved for decades, limiting the scope of causality-based decision-making. In this paper, we resolve this foundational gap by proposing a complete set of representative probabilities of causation and proving that they are sufficient to characterize all possible probabilities of causation within the framework of Structural Causal Models (SCMs). We then formally derive tight bounds for these representative quantities using formal mathematical proofs. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our results through illustrative toy examples.</description>

      <title>SMART: Self-Generating and Self-Validating Multi-Dimensional Assessment for LLMs' Mathematical Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of mathematical benchmarks. However, concerns remain as to whether these successes reflect genuine reasoning or superficial pattern recognition. Common evaluation methods, which focus on the either the final answer or the reasoning process, fail to assess the entire problem-solving procedure. To address these limitations, we introduce SMART: a Self-Generating and Self-Validating Multi-Dimensional Assessment Framework, together with its corresponding benchmark, SMART-Bench. SMART decomposes the entire problem solving process into four distinct cognitive dimensions: Understanding, Reasoning, Arithmetic, and Reflection \&amp; Refinement. Each dimension is evaluated independently through tailored tasks, enabling interpretable and fine-grained analysis of LLM behavior. We apply SMART to 21 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs, uncovering significant discrepancies in their abilities across different dimensions. Our findings reveal genuine weaknesses in current LLMs and motivate a new metric, the All-Pass Score, to better capture true problem-solving capabilities. Code and benchmarks will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Personalized Constitutionally-Aligned Agentic Superego: Secure AI Behavior Aligned to Diverse Human Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems, possessing capabilities for autonomous planning and action, show great potential across diverse domains. However, their practical deployment is hindered by challenges in aligning their behavior with varied human values, complex safety requirements, and specific compliance needs. Existing alignment methodologies often falter when faced with the complex task of providing personalized context without inducing confabulation or operational inefficiencies. This paper introduces a novel solution: a 'superego' agent, designed as a personalized oversight mechanism for agentic AI. This system dynamically steers AI planning by referencing user-selected 'Creed Constitutions' encapsulating diverse rule sets -- with adjustable adherence levels to fit non-negotiable values. A real-time compliance enforcer validates plans against these constitutions and a universal ethical floor before execution. We present a functional system, including a demonstration interface with a prototypical constitution-sharing portal, and successful integration with third-party models via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Comprehensive benchmark evaluations (HarmBench, AgentHarm) demonstrate that our Superego agent dramatically reduces harmful outputs -- achieving up to a 98.3% harm score reduction and near-perfect refusal rates (e.g., 100% with Claude Sonnet 4 on AgentHarm's harmful set) for leading LLMs like Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4o. This approach substantially simplifies personalized AI alignment, rendering agentic systems more reliably attuned to individual and cultural contexts, while also enabling substantial safety improvements. An overview on this research with examples is available at https://superego.creed.space.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Hybrid Charging Stations Planning and Operation Considering Fixed and Mobile Chargers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of vehicle electrification relies on efficient and adaptable charging infrastructure. Fixed-location charging stations often suffer from underutilization or congestion due to fluctuating demand, while mobile chargers offer flexibility by relocating as needed. This paper studies the optimal planning and operation of hybrid charging infrastructures that combine both fixed and mobile chargers within urban road networks. We formulate the Hybrid Charging Station Planning and Operation (HCSPO) problem, jointly optimizing the placement of fixed stations and the scheduling of mobile chargers. A charging demand prediction model based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) supports dynamic decision-making. To solve the HCSPO problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach enhanced with heuristic scheduling. Experiments on real-world urban scenarios show that our method improves infrastructure availability - achieving up to 244.4% increase in coverage - and reduces user inconvenience with up to 79.8% shorter waiting times, compared to existing solutions.</description>

      <title>UI-AGILE: Advancing GUI Agents with Effective Reinforcement Learning and Precise Inference-Time Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE for enhancing GUI agents at both training and inference. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a continuous reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a ``Simple Thinking'' reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a cropping-based resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present decomposed grounding with selection to dramatically improve grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art grounding performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 while it also exhibits strong general agent capabilities. For instance, using both our training and inference enhancement methods brings 23\% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro. We provide the code in https://github.com/KDEGroup/UI-AGILE.</description>

      <title>TextQuests: How Good are LLMs at Text-Based Video Games?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.</description>

      <title>H2C: Hippocampal Circuit-inspired Continual Learning for Lifelong Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD). However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this, we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts. The implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.</description>

Abstract: The Game Reasoning Arena library provides a framework for evaluating the decision making abilities of large language models (LLMs) through strategic board games implemented in Google OpenSpiel library. The framework enables systematic comparisons between LLM based agents and other agents (random, heuristic, reinforcement learning agents, etc.) in various game scenarios by wrapping multiple board and matrix games and supporting different agent types. It integrates API access to models via liteLLM, local model deployment via vLLM, and offers distributed execution through Ray. This paper summarises the library structure, key characteristics, and motivation of the repository, highlighting how it contributes to the empirical evaluation of the reasoning of LLM and game theoretic behaviour.</description>

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text, images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.</description>

      <title>Overconfidence in LLM-as-a-Judge: Diagnosis and Confidence-Driven Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as automated judges, where practical value depends on both accuracy and trustworthy, risk-aware judgments. Existing approaches predominantly focus on accuracy, overlooking the necessity of well-calibrated confidence, which is vital for adaptive and reliable evaluation pipelines. In this work, we advocate a shift from accuracy-centric evaluation to confidence-driven, risk-aware LLM-as-a-Judge systems, emphasizing the necessity of well-calibrated confidence for trustworthy and adaptive evaluation. We systematically identify the Overconfidence Phenomenon in current LLM-as-a-Judges, where predicted confidence significantly overstates actual correctness, undermining reliability in practical deployment. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce TH-Score, a novel metric measuring confidence-accuracy alignment. Furthermore, we propose LLM-as-a-Fuser, an ensemble framework that transforms LLMs into reliable, risk-aware evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves calibration and enables adaptive, confidence-driven evaluation pipelines, achieving superior reliability and accuracy compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of inductive logic programming is to search for a hypothesis that generalises training data and background knowledge. The challenge is searching vast hypothesis spaces, which is exacerbated because many logically equivalent hypotheses exist. To address this challenge, we introduce a method to break symmetries in the hypothesis space. We implement our idea in answer set programming. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can reduce solving times from over an hour to just 17 seconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art multi-objective optimization often assumes a known utility function, learns it interactively, or computes the full Pareto front-each requiring costly expert input.~Real-world problems, however, involve implicit preferences that are hard to formalize. To reduce expert involvement, we propose an offline, interpretable utility learning method that uses expert knowledge, historical examples, and coarse information about the utility space to reduce sample requirements. We model uncertainty via a full Bayesian posterior and propagate it throughout the optimization process. Our method outperforms standard Gaussian processes and BOPE across four domains, showing strong performance even with biased samples, as encountered in the real-world, and limited expert input.</description>

      <title>Active Policy Improvement from Multiple Black-box Oracles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in various complex domains. However, identifying an effective policy via RL often necessitates extensive exploration. Imitation learning aims to mitigate this issue by using expert demonstrations to guide exploration. In real-world scenarios, one often has access to multiple suboptimal black-box experts, rather than a single optimal oracle. These experts do not universally outperform each other across all states, presenting a challenge in actively deciding which oracle to use and in which state. We introduce MAPS and MAPS-SE, a class of policy improvement algorithms that perform imitation learning from multiple suboptimal oracles. In particular, MAPS actively selects which of the oracles to imitate and improve their value function estimates, and MAPS-SE additionally leverages an active state exploration criterion to determine which states one should explore. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis and demonstrate that MAPS and MAPS-SE enjoy sample efficiency advantage over the state-of-the-art policy improvement algorithms. Empirical results show that MAPS-SE significantly accelerates policy optimization via state-wise imitation learning from multiple oracles across a broad spectrum of control tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ripl/maps.</description>

      <title>Blending Imitation and Reinforcement Learning for Robust Policy Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising performance, its sample complexity continues to be a substantial hurdle, restricting its broader application across a variety of domains. Imitation learning (IL) utilizes oracles to improve sample efficiency, yet it is often constrained by the quality of the oracles deployed. which actively interleaves between IL and RL based on an online estimate of their performance. RPI draws on the strengths of IL, using oracle queries to facilitate exploration, an aspect that is notably challenging in sparse-reward RL, particularly during the early stages of learning. As learning unfolds, RPI gradually transitions to RL, effectively treating the learned policy as an improved oracle. This algorithm is capable of learning from and improving upon a diverse set of black-box oracles. Integral to RPI are Robust Active Policy Selection (RAPS) and Robust Policy Gradient (RPG), both of which reason over whether to perform state-wise imitation from the oracles or learn from its own value function when the learner's performance surpasses that of the oracles in a specific state. Empirical evaluations and theoretical analysis validate that RPI excels in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methodologies, demonstrating superior performance across various benchmark domains.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks Can Learn Generalizable Same-Different Visual Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks can achieve human-level performance on many object recognition benchmarks, prior work suggests that these same models fail to learn simple abstract relations, such as determining whether two objects are the same or different. Much of this prior work focuses on training convolutional neural networks to classify images of two same or two different abstract shapes, testing generalization on within-distribution stimuli. In this article, we comprehensively study whether deep neural networks can acquire and generalize same-different relations both within and out-of-distribution using a variety of architectures, forms of pretraining, and fine-tuning datasets. We find that certain pretrained transformers can learn a same-different relation that generalizes with near perfect accuracy to out-of-distribution stimuli. Furthermore, we find that fine-tuning on abstract shapes that lack texture or color provides the strongest out-of-distribution generalization. Our results suggest that, with the right approach, deep neural networks can learn generalizable same-different visual relations.</description>

      <title>ComPEFT: Compression for Communicating Parameter Efficient Updates via Sparsification and Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques make it possible to efficiently adapt a language model to create "expert" models that specialize to new tasks or domains. Recent techniques in model merging and compositional generalization leverage these expert models by dynamically composing modules to improve zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the efficiency of PEFT methods, the size of expert models can make it onerous to retrieve expert models per query over high-latency networks like the Internet or serve multiple experts on a single GPU. To address these issues, we present ComPEFT, a novel method for compressing fine-tuning residuals (task vectors) of PEFT based models. ComPEFT employs sparsification and ternary quantization to reduce the size of the PEFT module without performing any additional retraining while preserving or enhancing model performance. In extensive evaluation across T5, T0, and LLaMA-based models with 200M - 65B parameters, ComPEFT achieves compression ratios of 8x - 50x. In particular, we show that ComPEFT improves with scale - stronger models exhibit higher compressibility and better performance. For example, we show that ComPEFT applied to LLaMA outperforms QLoRA by 4.16% on MMLU with a storage size reduction of up to 26x. In addition, we show that the compressed experts produced by ComPEFT maintain few-shot compositional generalization capabilities, facilitate efficient communication and computation, and exhibit enhanced performance when merged. Lastly, we provide an analysis of different method components, compare it with other PEFT methods, and test ComPEFT's efficacy for compressing the residual of full-finetuning.

      <title>Sparse Variational Student-t Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of Bayesian learning incorporates the use of Student-t Processes to model heavy-tailed distributions and datasets with outliers. However, despite Student-t Processes having a similar computational complexity as Gaussian Processes, there has been limited emphasis on the sparse representation of this model. This is mainly due to the increased difficulty in modeling and computation compared to previous sparse Gaussian Processes. Our motivation is to address the need for a sparse representation framework that reduces computational complexity, allowing Student-t Processes to be more flexible for real-world datasets. To achieve this, we leverage the conditional distribution of Student-t Processes to introduce sparse inducing points. Bayesian methods and variational inference are then utilized to derive a well-defined lower bound, facilitating more efficient optimization of our model through stochastic gradient descent. We propose two methods for computing the variational lower bound, one utilizing Monte Carlo sampling and the other employing Jensen's inequality to compute the KL regularization term in the loss function. We propose adopting these approaches as viable alternatives to Gaussian processes when the data might contain outliers or exhibit heavy-tailed behavior, and we provide specific recommendations for their applicability. We evaluate the two proposed approaches on various synthetic and real-world datasets from UCI and Kaggle, demonstrating their effectiveness compared to baseline methods in terms of computational complexity and accuracy, as well as their robustness to outliers.</description>

      <title>SARDet-100K: Towards Open-Source Benchmark and ToolKit for Large-Scale SAR Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection has gained significant attention recently due to its irreplaceable all-weather imaging capabilities. However, this research field suffers from both limited public datasets (mostly comprising &lt;2K images with only mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. To tackle these challenges, we establish a new benchmark dataset and an open-source method for large-scale SAR object detection. Our dataset, SARDet-100K, is a result of intense surveying, collecting, and standardizing 10 existing SAR detection datasets, providing a large-scale and diverse dataset for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SARDet-100K is the first COCO-level large-scale multi-class SAR object detection dataset ever created. With this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive experiments and uncovered a crucial challenge in SAR object detection: the substantial disparities between the pretraining on RGB datasets and finetuning on SAR datasets in terms of both data domain and model structure. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pretraining framework that tackles the problems from the perspective of data input, domain transition, and model migration. The proposed MSFA method significantly enhances the performance of SAR object detection models while demonstrating exceptional generalizability and flexibility across diverse models. This work aims to pave the way for further advancements in SAR object detection. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/zcablii/SARDet_100K.</description>

      <title>Griffon v2: Advancing Multimodal Perception with High-Resolution Scaling and Visual-Language Co-Referring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models have achieved fine-grained object perception, but the limitation of image resolution remains a significant obstacle to surpassing the performance of task-specific experts in complex and dense scenarios. Such limitation further restricts the model's potential to achieve nuanced visual and language referring in domains such as GUI Agents, counting, \textit{etc}. To address this issue, we introduce a unified high-resolution generalist model, Griffon v2, enabling flexible object referring with visual and textual prompts. To efficiently scale up image resolution, we design a simple and lightweight down-sampling projector to overcome the input tokens constraint in Large Language Models. This design inherently preserves the complete contexts and fine details and significantly improves multimodal perception ability, especially for small objects. Building upon this, we further equip the model with visual-language co-referring capabilities through a plug-and-play visual tokenizer. It enables user-friendly interaction with flexible target images, free-form texts, and even coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that Griffon v2 can localize objects of interest with visual and textual referring, achieve state-of-the-art performance on REC and phrase grounding, and outperform expert models in object detection, object counting, and REG. Data and codes are released at https://github.com/jefferyZhan/Griffon.</description>

      <title>On the Sample Efficiency of Abstractions and Potential-Based Reward Shaping in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) has shown great promise in the ongoing research effort to tackle sample inefficiency in Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, choosing the right potential function remains an open challenge. Additionally, RL techniques are usually constrained to use a finite horizon for computational limitations, which introduces a bias when using PBRS. In this paper, we first build some theoretically-grounded intuition on why selecting the potential function as the optimal value function of the task at hand produces performance advantages. We then analyse the bias induced by finite horizons in the context of PBRS producing novel insights. Finally, leveraging abstractions as a way to approximate the optimal value function of the given task, we assess the sample efficiency and performance impact of PBRS on four environments including a goal-oriented navigation task and three Arcade Learning Environments (ALE) games. Remarkably, experimental results show that we can reach the same level of performance as CNN-based solutions with a simple fully-connected network.</description>

      <title>Runtime Monitoring and Enforcement of Conditional Fairness in Generative AIs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16663v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of generative AI (GenAI) models raises significant fairness concerns, addressed in this paper through novel characterization and enforcement techniques specific to GenAI. Unlike standard AI performing specific tasks, GenAI's broad functionality requires ``conditional fairness'' tailored to the context being generated, such as demographic fairness in generating images of poor people versus successful business leaders. We define two fairness levels: the first evaluates fairness in generated outputs, independent of prompts and models; the second assesses inherent fairness with neutral prompts. Given the complexity of GenAI and challenges in fairness specifications, we focus on bounding the worst case, considering a GenAI system unfair if the distance between appearances of a specific group exceeds preset thresholds. We also explore combinatorial testing for assessing relative completeness in intersectional fairness. By bounding the worst case, we develop a prompt injection scheme within an agent-based framework to enforce conditional fairness with minimal intervention, validated on state-of-the-art GenAI systems.</description>

      <title>Fractured Glass, Failing Cameras: Simulating Physics-Based Adversarial Samples for Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While much research has recently focused on generating physics-based adversarial samples, a critical yet often overlooked category originates from physical failures within on-board cameras -- components essential to the perception systems of autonomous vehicles. Firstly, we motivate the study using two separate real-world experiments to showcase that indeed glass failures would cause the detection based neural network models to fail. Secondly, we develop a simulation-based study using the physical process of the glass breakage to create perturbed scenarios, representing a realistic class of physics-based adversarial samples. Using a finite element model (FEM)-based approach, we generate surface cracks on the camera image by applying a stress field defined by particles within a triangular mesh. Lastly, we use physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to provide realistic visualizations of these physically plausible fractures. To analyze the safety implications, we superimpose these simulated broken glass effects as image filters on widely used open-source datasets: KITTI and BDD100K using two most prominent object detection neural networks (CNN-based -- YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN) and Pyramid Vision Transformers. To further investigate the distributional impact of these visual distortions, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between three distinct data distributions, applying various broken glass filters to a custom dataset (captured through a cracked windshield), as well as the KITTI and Kaggle cats and dogs datasets. The K-L divergence analysis suggests that these broken glass filters do not introduce significant distributional shifts.</description>

      <title>From Spikes to Heavy Tails: Unveiling the Spectral Evolution of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training strategies for modern deep neural networks (NNs) tend to induce a heavy-tailed (HT) empirical spectral density (ESD) in the layer weights. While previous efforts have shown that the HT phenomenon correlates with good generalization in large NNs, a theoretical explanation of its occurrence is still lacking. Especially, understanding the conditions which lead to this phenomenon can shed light on the interplay between generalization and weight spectra. Our work aims to bridge this gap by presenting a simple, rich setting to model the emergence of HT ESD. In particular, we present a theory-informed setup for 'crafting' heavy tails in the ESD of two-layer NNs and present a systematic analysis of the HT ESD emergence without any gradient noise. This is the first work to analyze a noise-free setting, and we also incorporate optimizer (GD/Adam) dependent (large) learning rates into the HT ESD analysis. Our results highlight the role of learning rates on the Bulk+Spike and HT shape of the ESDs in the early phase of training, which can facilitate generalization in the two-layer NN. These observations shed light on the behavior of large-scale NNs, albeit in a much simpler setting.</description>

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models has markedly enhanced the understanding of short videos (typically under one minute), and several evaluation datasets have emerged accordingly. However, these advancements fall short of meeting the demands of real-world applications such as embodied intelligence for long-term decision-making, in-depth movie reviews and discussions, and live sports commentary, all of which require comprehension of long videos spanning several hours. To address this gap, we introduce LVBench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video understanding. Our dataset comprises publicly sourced videos and encompasses a diverse set of tasks aimed at long video comprehension and information extraction. LVBench is designed to challenge multimodal models to demonstrate long-term memory and extended comprehension capabilities. Our extensive evaluations reveal that current multimodal models still underperform on these demanding long video understanding tasks. Through LVBench, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of tackling the complexities of long video comprehension. Our data and code are publicly available at: https://lvbench.github.io.</description>

      <title>AI-AI Bias: large language models favor communications generated by large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are large language models (LLMs) biased in favor of communications produced by LLMs, leading to possible antihuman discrimination? Using a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely used LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and a selection of recent open-weight models in binary choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based assistants selecting between goods (the goods we study include consumer products, academic papers, and film-viewings) described either by humans or LLMs. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-presented options. This suggests the possibility of future AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans as a class, giving AI agents and AI-assisted humans an unfair advantage.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Model MoErging: Recycling and Routing Among Specialized Experts for Collaborative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to a particular domain or task. Model MoErging methods aim to recycle expert models to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization. A key component of MoErging methods is the creation of a router that decides which expert model(s) to use for a particular input or application. The promise, effectiveness, and large design space of MoErging has spurred the development of many new methods over the past few years. This rapid pace of development has made it challenging to compare different MoErging methods, which are rarely compared to one another and are often validated in different experimental setups. To remedy such gaps, we present a comprehensive survey of MoErging methods that includes a novel taxonomy for cataloging key design choices and clarifying suitable applications for each method. Apart from surveying MoErging research, we inventory software tools and applications that make use of MoErging. We additionally discuss related fields of study such as model merging, multitask learning, and mixture-of-experts models. Taken as a whole, our survey provides a unified overview of existing MoErging methods and creates a solid foundation for future work in this burgeoning field.</description>

      <title>Chain of Thought Still Thinks Fast: APriCoT Helps with Thinking Slow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models are known to absorb biases from their training data, leading to predictions driven by statistical regularities rather than semantic relevance. We investigate the impact of these biases on answer choice preferences in the Massive Multi-Task Language Understanding (MMLU) task. Our findings show that these biases are predictive of model preference and mirror human test-taking strategies even when chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is used. To address this issue, we introduce Counterfactual Prompting with Agnostically Primed CoT (APriCoT). We demonstrate that while Counterfactual Prompting with CoT alone is insufficient to mitigate bias, APriCoT effectively reduces the influence of base-rate probabilities while improving overall accuracy. Our results suggest that mitigating bias requires a slow thinking process which CoT alone may not provide as it tends to reinforce fast thinking model bias under some prompting methodologies. APriCoT is a step toward developing more robust and fair language models that can think slow.</description>

      <title>Reward-Directed Score-Based Diffusion Models via q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new reinforcement learning (RL) formulation for training continuous-time score-based diffusion models for generative AI to generate samples that maximize reward functions while keeping the generated distributions close to the unknown target data distributions. Different from most existing studies, ours does not involve any pretrained model for the unknown score functions of the noise-perturbed data distributions, nor does it attempt to learn the score functions. Instead, we formulate the problem as entropy-regularized continuous-time RL and show that the optimal stochastic policy has a Gaussian distribution with a known covariance matrix. Based on this result, we parameterize the mean of Gaussian policies and develop an actor--critic type (little) q-learning algorithm to solve the RL problem. A key ingredient in our algorithm design is to obtain noisy observations from the unknown score function via a ratio estimator. Our formulation can also be adapted to solve pure score-matching and fine-tuning pretrained models. Numerically, we show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with two state-of-the-art RL methods that fine-tune pretrained models on several generative tasks including high-dimensional image generations. Finally, we discuss extensions of our RL formulation to probability flow ODE implementation of diffusion models and to conditional diffusion models.</description>

      <title>A Practice of Post-Training on Llama-3 70B with Optimal Selection of Additional Language Mixture Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) often need to be Continual Pre-Trained (CPT) to obtain unfamiliar language skills or adapt to new domains. The huge training cost of CPT often asks for cautious choice of key hyper-parameters such as the mixture ratio of extra language or domain corpus. However, there is no systematic study that bridges the gap between the optimal mixture ratio and the actual model performance, and the gap between experimental scaling law and the actual deployment in the full model size. In this paper, we perform CPT on Llama-3 8B and 70B to enhance its Chinese ability. We study the optimal correlation between the Additional Language Mixture Ratio (ALMR) and the Learning Rate (LR) on the 8B size which directly indicates the optimal experimental setup. By thorough choice of hyper-parameter, and subsequent fine-tuning, the model capability is improved not only on the Chinese-related benchmark but also in some specific domains including math, coding, and emotional intelligence. We deploy the final 70B version of LLM on a real-life chat system which obtains satisfying performance.</description>

      <title>EEG-Language Pretraining for Highly Label-Efficient Clinical Phenotyping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07480v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language modeling has enabled breakthroughs for representation learning, yet remains unexplored in the realm of functional brain data for clinical phenotyping. This paper pioneers EEG-language models (ELMs) trained on clinical reports and 15000 EEGs. We propose to combine multimodal alignment in this novel domain with timeseries cropping and text segmentation, enabling an extension based on multiple instance learning to alleviate misalignment between irrelevant EEG or text segments. Our multimodal models significantly improve over EEG-only models across four clinical evaluations and for the first time enable zero-shot classification as well as retrieval of both neural signals and reports. In sum, these results highlight the potential of ELMs, representing significant progress for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Fine-Tuning of Wildlife Models in IoT-Enabled Camera Traps for Efficient Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resource-constrained IoT devices increasingly rely on deep learning models, however, these models experience significant accuracy drops due to domain shifts when encountering variations in lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. While cloud-based retraining can address this issue, many IoT deployments operate with limited connectivity and energy constraints, making traditional fine-tuning approaches impractical. We explore this challenge through the lens of wildlife ecology, where camera traps must maintain accurate species classification across changing seasons, weather, and habitats without reliable connectivity. We introduce WildFit, an autonomous in-situ adaptation framework that leverages the key insight that background scenes change more frequently than the visual characteristics of monitored species. WildFit combines background-aware synthesis to generate training samples on-device with drift-aware fine-tuning that triggers model updates only when necessary to conserve resources. Our background-aware synthesis surpasses efficient baselines by 7.3\% and diffusion models by 3.0\% while being orders of magnitude faster, our drift-aware fine-tuning achieves Pareto optimality with 50\% fewer updates and 1.5\% higher accuracy, and the end-to-end system outperforms domain adaptation approaches by 20--35%\% while consuming only 11.2 Wh over 37 days -- enabling battery-powered deployment.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08109v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may memorize sensitive or copyrighted content, raising privacy and legal concerns. Due to the high cost of retraining from scratch, researchers attempt to employ machine unlearning to remove specific content from LLMs while preserving the overall performance. In this paper, we discuss several issues in machine unlearning for LLMs and provide our insights on possible approaches. To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning. Experimental results across three scenarios, i.e., fictitious unlearning, continual unlearning, and real-world unlearning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/closer-look-LLM-unlearning.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spatial Representation to Enhance LLM Reasoning in Aerial Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a novel task enabling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate in outdoor environments through natural language instructions and visual cues. However, it remains challenging due to the complex spatial relationships in aerial scenes.In this paper, we propose a training-free, zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large language model (LLM) is leveraged as the agent for action prediction. Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting and projecting instruction-related semantic masks onto a top-down map, which presents spatial and topological information about surrounding landmarks and grows during the navigation process. At each step, a local map centered at the UAV is extracted from the growing top-down map, and transformed into a ma trix representation with distance metrics, serving as the text prompt to LLM for action prediction in response to the given instruction. Experiments conducted in real and simulation environments have proved the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving absolute success rate improvements of 26.8% and 5.8% over current state-of-the-art methods on simple and complex navigation tasks, respectively. The dataset and code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>MaCP: Minimal yet Mighty Adaptation via Hierarchical Cosine Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new adaptation method MaCP, Minimal yet Mighty adaptive Cosine Projection, that achieves exceptional performance while requiring minimal parameters and memory for fine-tuning large foundation models. Its general idea is to exploit the superior energy compaction and decorrelation properties of cosine projection to improve both model efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, it projects the weight change from the low-rank adaptation into the discrete cosine space. Then, the weight change is partitioned over different levels of the discrete cosine spectrum, and each partition's most critical frequency components are selected. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MaCP across a wide range of single-modality tasks, including natural language understanding, natural language generation, text summarization, as well as multi-modality tasks such as image classification and video understanding. MaCP consistently delivers superior accuracy, significantly reduced computational complexity, and lower memory requirements compared to existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>UoMo: A Universal Model of Mobile Traffic Forecasting for Wireless Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile traffic forecasting allows operators to anticipate network dynamics and performance in advance, offering substantial potential for enhancing service quality and improving user experience. However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality.</description>

      <title>EfficientEQA: An Efficient Approach to Open-Vocabulary Embodied Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is an essential yet challenging task for robot assistants. Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for EQA, but existing approaches either treat it as static video question answering without active exploration or restrict answers to a closed set of choices. These limitations hinder real-world applicability, where a robot must explore efficiently and provide accurate answers in open-vocabulary settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EfficientEQA, a novel framework that couples efficient exploration with free-form answer generation. EfficientEQA features three key innovations: (1) Semantic-Value-Weighted Frontier Exploration (SFE) with Verbalized Confidence (VC) from a black-box VLM to prioritize semantically important areas to explore, enabling the agent to gather relevant information faster; (2) a BLIP relevancy-based mechanism to stop adaptively by flagging highly relevant observations as outliers to indicate whether the agent has collected enough information; and (3) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method for the VLM to answer accurately based on pertinent images from the agent's observation history without relying on predefined choices. Our experimental results show that EfficientEQA achieves over 15% higher answer accuracy and requires over 20% fewer exploration steps than state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via Content-Aware Timbre Ensemble and Conditional Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in zero-shot voice conversion (VC), achieving speaker similarity and naturalness comparable to ground-truth recordings remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we propose CTEFM-VC, a zero-shot VC framework that integrates content-aware timbre ensemble modeling with conditional flow matching. Specifically, CTEFM-VC decouples utterances into content and timbre representations and leverages a conditional flow matching model to reconstruct the Mel-spectrogram of the source speech. To enhance its timbre modeling capability and naturalness of generated speech, we first introduce a context-aware timbre ensemble modeling approach that adaptively integrates diverse speaker verification embeddings and enables the effective utilization of source content and target timbre elements through a cross-attention module. Furthermore, a structural similarity-based timbre loss is presented to jointly train CTEFM-VC end-to-end. Experiments show that CTEFM-VC consistently achieves the best performance in all metrics assessing speaker similarity, speech naturalness, and intelligibility, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art zero-shot VC systems.</description>

      <title>Steering AI-Driven Personalization of Scientific Text for General Audiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital media platforms (e.g., science blogs) offer opportunities to communicate scientific content to general audiences at scale. However, these audiences vary in their scientific expertise, literacy levels, and personal backgrounds, making effective science communication challenging. To address this challenge, we designed TranSlider, an AI-powered tool that generates personalized translations of scientific text based on individual user profiles (e.g., hobbies, location, and education). Our tool features an interactive slider that allows users to steer the degree of personalization from 0 (weakly relatable) to 100 (strongly relatable), leveraging LLMs to generate the translations with chosen degrees. Through an exploratory study with 15 participants, we investigated both the utility of these AI-personalized translations and how interactive reading features influenced users' understanding and reading experiences. We found that participants who preferred higher degrees of personalization appreciated the relatable and contextual translations, while those who preferred lower degrees valued concise translations with subtle contextualization. Furthermore, participants reported the compounding effect of multiple translations on their understanding of scientific content. Drawing on these findings, we discuss several implications for facilitating science communication and designing steerable interfaces to support human-AI alignment.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Mitigating Memorization in Generative Models via Sharpness of Probability Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04140v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a geometric framework to analyze memorization in diffusion models through the sharpness of the log probability density. We mathematically justify a previously proposed score-difference-based memorization metric by demonstrating its effectiveness in quantifying sharpness. Additionally, we propose a novel memorization metric that captures sharpness at the initial stage of image generation in latent diffusion models, offering early insights into potential memorization. Leveraging this metric, we develop a mitigation strategy that optimizes the initial noise of the generation process using a sharpness-aware regularization term.</description>

      <title>LoRA.rar: Learning to Merge LoRAs via Hypernetworks for Subject-Style Conditioned Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled personalized image creation with both user-defined subjects (content) and styles. Prior works achieved personalization by merging corresponding low-rank adapters (LoRAs) through optimization-based methods, which are computationally demanding and unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained devices like smartphones. To address this, we introduce LoRA$.$rar, a method that not only improves image quality but also achieves a remarkable speedup of over $4000\times$ in the merging process. We collect a dataset of style and subject LoRAs and pre-train a hypernetwork on a diverse set of content-style LoRA pairs, learning an efficient merging strategy that generalizes to new, unseen content-style pairs, enabling fast, high-quality personalization. Moreover, we identify limitations in existing evaluation metrics for content-style quality and propose a new protocol using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for more accurate assessment. Our method significantly outperforms the current state of the art in both content and style fidelity, as validated by MLLM assessments and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

      <title>POEX: Towards Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks Against the LLM-based Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of LLMs into robots has witnessed significant growth, where LLMs can convert instructions into executable robot policies. However, the inherent vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks brings critical security risks from the digital domain to the physical world. An attacked LLM-based robot could execute harmful policies and cause physical harm. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and rationale of jailbreak attacks against LLM-based robots and answer three research questions: (1) How applicable are existing LLM jailbreak attacks against LLM-based robots? (2) What unique challenges arise if they are not directly applicable? (3) How to defend against such jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first construct a "human-object-environment" robot risks-oriented Harmful-RLbench and then conduct a measurement study on LLM-based robot systems. Our findings conclude that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are inapplicable in robot scenarios, and we identify two unique challenges: determining policy-executable optimization directions and accurately evaluating robot-jailbroken policies. To enable a more thorough security analysis, we introduce POEX (POlicy EXecutable) jailbreak, a red-teaming framework that induces harmful yet executable policy to jailbreak LLM-based robots. POEX incorporates hidden layer gradient optimization to guarantee jailbreak success and policy execution as well as a multi-agent evaluator to accurately assess the practical executability of policies. Experiments conducted on the real-world robotic systems and in simulation demonstrate the efficacy of POEX, highlighting critical security vulnerabilities and its transferability across LLMs. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses to mitigate attacks. Our findings underscore the urgent need for security measures to ensure the safe deployment of LLM-based robots in critical applications.</description>

      <title>MomentMix Augmentation with Length-Aware DETR for Temporally Robust Moment Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) aims to localize moments within a video based on a given natural language query. Given the prevalent use of platforms like YouTube for information retrieval, the demand for MR techniques is significantly growing. Recent DETR-based models have made notable advances in performance but still struggle with accurately localizing short moments. Through data analysis, we identified limited feature diversity in short moments, which motivated the development of MomentMix. MomentMix employs two augmentation strategies: ForegroundMix and BackgroundMix, each enhancing the feature representations of the foreground and background, respectively. Additionally, our analysis of prediction bias revealed that short moments particularly struggle with accurately predicting their center positions of moments. To address this, we propose a Length-Aware Decoder, which conditions length through a novel bipartite matching process. Our extensive studies demonstrate the efficacy of our length-aware approach, especially in localizing short moments, leading to improved overall performance. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art DETR-based methods on benchmark datasets, achieving the highest R1 and mAP on QVHighlights and the highest R1@0.7 on TACoS and Charades-STA (such as a 2.46% gain in R1@0.7 and a 2.57% gain in mAP average for QVHighlights).

      <title>Toward Intelligent and Secure Cloud: Large Language Model Empowered Proactive Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of cloud computing technologies and the increasing number of cloud applications have provided numerous benefits in our daily lives. However, the diversity and complexity of different components pose a significant challenge to cloud security, especially when dealing with sophisticated and advanced cyberattacks such as Denial of Service (DoS). Recent advancements in the large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for security intelligence. By exploiting the powerful capabilities in language understanding, data analysis, task inference, action planning, and code generation, we present LLM-PD, a novel defense architecture that proactively mitigates various DoS threats in cloud networks. LLM-PD can efficiently make decisions through comprehensive data analysis and sequential reasoning, as well as dynamically create and deploy actionable defense mechanisms. Furthermore, it can flexibly self-evolve based on experience learned from previous interactions and adapt to new attack scenarios without additional training. Our case study on three distinct DoS attacks demonstrates its remarkable ability in terms of defense effectiveness and efficiency when compared with other existing methods.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Cel-Animation: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional Celluloid (Cel) Animation production pipeline encompasses multiple essential steps, including storyboarding, layout design, keyframe animation, inbetweening, and colorization, which demand substantial manual effort, technical expertise, and significant time investment. These challenges have historically impeded the efficiency and scalability of Cel-Animation production. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), encompassing large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, offers innovative solutions by automating tasks such as inbetween frame generation, colorization, and storyboard creation. This survey explores how GenAI integration is revolutionizing traditional animation workflows by lowering technical barriers, broadening accessibility for a wider range of creators through tools like AniDoc, ToonCrafter, and AniSora, and enabling artists to focus more on creative expression and artistic innovation. Despite its potential, challenges like visual consistency, stylistic coherence, and ethical considerations persist. Additionally, this paper explores future directions and advancements in AI-assisted animation.

      <description>arXiv:2501.07572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) demonstrates remarkable performance across tasks in open-domain question-answering. However, traditional search engines may retrieve shallow content, limiting the ability of LLMs to handle complex, multi-layered information. To address it, we introduce WebWalkerQA, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to perform web traversal. It evaluates the capacity of LLMs to traverse a website's subpages to extract high-quality data systematically. We propose WebWalker, which is a multi-agent framework that mimics human-like web navigation through an explore-critic paradigm. Extensive experimental results show that WebWalkerQA is challenging and demonstrates the effectiveness of RAG combined with WebWalker, through the horizontal and vertical integration in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of \emph{rank} of a Boolean function has been a cornerstone in PAC learning theory, enabling quasipolynomial-time learning algorithms for polynomial-size decision trees. We present a novel characterization of rank, grounded in the well-known Transformer architecture. We show that the rank of a function $f$ corresponds to the minimum number of \emph{Chain of Thought} (CoT) steps required by a single-layer Transformer with hard attention to compute $f$. Based on this characterization we establish tight bounds on the number of CoT steps required for specific problems, showing that \(\ell\)-fold function composition necessitates exactly \(\ell\) CoT steps. Furthermore, we analyze the problem of identifying the position of the \(k\)-th occurrence of 1 in a Boolean sequence, proving that it requires \(k\) CoT steps. Finally, we introduce the notion of the multi-head rank that captures multi-head single-layer transformers, and perform the analysis of PAC-learnability of the classes of functions with bounded multi-head rank.</description>

      <title>Softplus Attention with Re-weighting Boosts Length Extrapolation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13428v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in recent years, primarily due to the implementation of self-attention mechanisms. However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the length of inference tokens increases. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a new design principle for attention, viewing it as a two-stage process. We first decompose the Softmax operation into a non-linear positivity transformation and an $l_1$-normalisation step, identifying the latter as essential for maintaining model performance. In the first stage, we replace the standard exponential function with the more numerically stable Softplus activation and introduce a dynamic scale factor based on invariance entropy, creating a novel attention mechanism that outperforms conventional Softmax attention. In the second stage, we introduce a re-weighting mechanism that sharpens the attention distribution, amplifying significant weights while diminishing weaker ones. This enables the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens and fundamentally improves length extrapolation. When combined, this two-stage approach ensures numerical stability and dramatically improves length extrapolation, maintaining a nearly constant validation loss at 16$\times$ the training length while achieving superior results on challenging long-context retrieval tasks and standard downstream benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FIT-Print: Towards False-claim-resistant Model Ownership Verification via Targeted Fingerprint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15509v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model fingerprinting is a widely adopted approach to safeguard the intellectual property rights of open-source models by preventing their unauthorized reuse. It is promising and convenient since it does not necessitate modifying the protected model. In this paper, we revisit existing fingerprinting methods and reveal that they are vulnerable to false claim attacks where adversaries falsely assert ownership of any third-party model. We demonstrate that this vulnerability mostly stems from their untargeted nature, where they generally compare the outputs of given samples on different models instead of the similarities to specific references. Motivated by these findings, we propose a targeted fingerprinting paradigm (i.e., FIT-Print) to counteract false claim attacks. Specifically, FIT-Print transforms the fingerprint into a targeted signature via optimization. Building on the principles of FIT-Print, we develop bit-wise and list-wise black-box model fingerprinting methods, i.e., FIT-ModelDiff and FIT-LIME, which exploit the distance between model outputs and the feature attribution of specific samples as the fingerprint, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark models and datasets verify the effectiveness, conferrability, and resistance to false claim attacks of our FIT-Print.</description>

      <title>Improving Your Model Ranking on Chatbot Arena by Vote Rigging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chatbot Arena is a popular platform for evaluating LLMs by pairwise battles, where users vote for their preferred response from two randomly sampled anonymous models. While Chatbot Arena is widely regarded as a reliable LLM ranking leaderboard, we show that crowdsourced voting can be rigged to improve (or decrease) the ranking of a target model $m_{t}$. We first introduce a straightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles involving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and exclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins. However, this strategy is practically inefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average only about $1\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we propose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of Chatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the target model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle. We conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the Chatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve model rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes. While we have evaluated several defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to prevent vote rigging. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Rigging-ChatbotArena.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Traffic Oscillations in Mixed Traffic Flow with Scalable Deep Koopman Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating traffic oscillations in mixed flows of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is critical for enhancing traffic stability. A key challenge lies in modeling the nonlinear, heterogeneous behaviors of HDVs within computationally tractable predictive control frameworks. This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) to address this issue. The framework features a novel deep Koopman network, AdapKoopnet, which represents complex HDV car-following dynamics as a linear system in a high-dimensional space by adaptively learning from naturalistic data. This learned linear representation is then embedded into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, enabling real-time, scalable, and optimal control of CAVs. We validate our framework using the HighD dataset and extensive numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that AdapKoopnet achieves superior trajectory prediction accuracy over baseline models. Furthermore, the complete AdapKoopPC controller significantly dampens traffic oscillations with lower computational cost, exhibiting strong performance even at low CAV penetration rates. The proposed framework offers a scalable and data-driven solution for enhancing stability in realistic mixed traffic environments. The code is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>MQuant: Unleashing the Inference Potential of Multimodal Large Language Models via Full Static Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their ability to understand multimodal input. However, their large parameter sizes and substantial computational demands severely hinder their practical deployment and application.While quantization is an effective way to reduce model size and inference latency, its application to MLLMs remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Conventional quantization often struggles with MLLMs because of (a) high inference latency from large visual token counts, (b) distributional disparities between visual and textual tokens, and (c) extreme outliers introduced by Hadamard-based transformations. To address these issues, MQuant introduces: Modality-Specific Static Quantization (MSQ), assigning distinct static scales for visual vs. textual tokens; Attention-Invariant Flexible Switching (AIFS), reordering tokens to preserve casual attention while eliminating expensive token-wise scale computations; Rotation Magnitude Suppression (RMS), mitigating weight outliers arising from online Hadamard rotations. On five mainstream MLLMs (including Qwen-VL, MiniCPM-V, CogVLM2), MQuant under W4A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (&lt;1% degradation) while reducing inference latency by up to 30%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ baselines. Our MQuant effectively bridges the gap for efficient and accurate MLLMs inference in resource-constrained devices. Code has been released in https://github.com/StiphyJay/MQuant.</description>

      <title>Schema-Guided Scene-Graph Reasoning based on Multi-Agent Large Language Model System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scene graphs have emerged as a structured and serializable environment representation for grounded spatial reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we propose SG^2, an iterative Schema-Guided Scene-Graph reasoning framework based on multi-agent LLMs. The agents are grouped into two modules: a (1) Reasoner module for abstract task planning and graph information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever module for extracting corresponding graph information based on code-writing following the queries. Two modules collaborate iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph information. The scene graph schema, prompted to both modules, serves to not only streamline both reasoning and retrieval process, but also guide the cooperation between two modules. This eliminates the need to prompt LLMs with full graph data, reducing the chance of hallucination due to irrelevant information. Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches and baseline single-agent, tool-based Reason-while-Retrieve strategy in numerical Q\&amp;A and planning tasks.</description>

      <title>Predicting Depression in Screening Interviews from Interactive Multi-Theme Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic depression detection provides cues for early clinical intervention by clinicians. Clinical interviews for depression detection involve dialogues centered around multiple themes. Existing studies primarily design end-to-end neural network models to capture the hierarchical structure of clinical interview dialogues. However, these methods exhibit defects in modeling the thematic content of clinical interviews: 1) they fail to capture intra-theme and inter-theme correlation explicitly, and 2) they do not allow clinicians to intervene and focus on themes of interest. To address these issues, this paper introduces an interactive depression detection framework. This framework leverages in-context learning techniques to identify themes in clinical interviews and then models both intra-theme and inter-theme correlation. Additionally, it employs AI-driven feedback to simulate the interests of clinicians, enabling interactive adjustment of theme importance. PDIMC achieves absolute improvements of 35\% and 12\% compared to the state-of-the-art on the depression detection dataset DAIC-WOZ, which demonstrates the effectiveness of modeling theme correlation and incorporating interactive external feedback.</description>

      <title>Advancing AI-Powered Medical Image Synthesis: Insights from MedVQA-GI Challenge Using CLIP, Fine-Tuned Stable Diffusion, and Dream-Booth + LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MEDVQA-GI challenge addresses the integration of AI-driven text-to-image generative models in medical diagnostics, aiming to enhance diagnostic capabilities through synthetic image generation. Existing methods primarily focus on static image analysis and lack the dynamic generation of medical imagery from textual descriptions. This study intends to partially close this gap by introducing a novel approach based on fine-tuned generative models to generate dynamic, scalable, and precise images from textual descriptions. Particularly, our system integrates fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth models, as well as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), to generate high-fidelity medical images. The problem is around two sub-tasks namely: image synthesis (IS) and optimal prompt production (OPG). The former creates medical images via verbal prompts, whereas the latter provides prompts that produce high-quality images in specified categories. The study emphasizes the limitations of traditional medical image generation methods, such as hand sketching, constrained datasets, static procedures, and generic models. Our evaluation measures showed that Stable Diffusion surpasses CLIP and DreamBooth + LORA in terms of producing high-quality, diversified images. Specifically, Stable Diffusion had the lowest Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores (0.099 for single center, 0.064 for multi-center, and 0.067 for combined), indicating higher image quality. Furthermore, it had the highest average Inception Score (2.327 across all datasets), indicating exceptional diversity and quality. This advances the field of AI-powered medical diagnosis. Future research will concentrate on model refining, dataset augmentation, and ethical considerations for efficiently implementing these advances into clinical practice</description>

      <title>Collective Reasoning Among LLMs: A Framework for Answer Validation Without Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach in which several advanced large language models-specifically GPT-4-0125-preview, Meta-LLAMA-3-70B-Instruct, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.5-Flash-collaborate to both produce and answer intricate, doctoral-level probability problems without relying on any single "correct" reference. Rather than depending on an established ground truth, our investigation focuses on how agreement among diverse models can signal the reliability of their outputs and, by extension, reflect the overall quality of the generated questions. To measure this inter-model alignment, we apply a suite of statistical evaluations, including chi-square tests, Fleiss' Kappa coefficients, and confidence interval calculations, thereby capturing both precision in answers and clarity in question phrasing. Our analysis reveals that Claude and Gemini tend to frame questions more coherently and unambiguously, which is evidenced by their tighter confidence intervals and greater concordance with responding agents. In contrast, LLAMA exhibits wider confidence bands and a lower level of agreement, indicating more variability and reduced consistency in its question formulations. These observations support the notion that a multi-model collaborative strategy not only improves answer dependability but also offers an effective, data-driven mechanism for evaluating and refining question quality when no definitive solution exists. Ultimately, this work delivers actionable insights into enhancing AI-guided reasoning processes through coordinated interactions among heterogeneous language models.</description>

      <title>ElementaryNet: A Non-Strategic Neural Network for Predicting Human Behavior in Normal-Form Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavioral game theory models serve two purposes: yielding insights into how human decision-making works, and predicting how people would behave in novel strategic settings. A system called GameNet represents the state of the art for predicting human behavior in the setting of unrepeated simultaneous-move games, combining a simple "level-k" model of strategic reasoning with a complex neural network model of non-strategic "level-0" behavior. Although this reliance on well-established ideas from cognitive science ought to make GameNet interpretable, the flexibility of its level-0 model raises the possibility that it is able to emulate strategic reasoning. In this work, we prove that GameNet's level-0 model is indeed too general. We then introduce ElementaryNet, a novel neural network that is provably incapable of expressing strategic behavior. We show that these additional restrictions are empirically harmless, leading ElementaryNet to statistically indistinguishable predictive performance vs GameNet. We then show how it is possible to derive insights about human behavior by varying ElementaryNet's features and interpreting its parameters, finding evidence of iterative reasoning, learning about the depth of this reasoning process, and showing the value of a rich level-0 specification.</description>

      <title>From Reusing to Forecasting: Accelerating Diffusion Models with TaylorSeers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

      <title>FunGraph: Functionality Aware 3D Scene Graphs for Language-Prompted Scene Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of 3D scene graphs is increasingly recognized as a powerful semantic and hierarchical representation of the environment. Current approaches often address this at a coarse, object-level resolution. In contrast, our goal is to develop a representation that enables robots to directly interact with their environment by identifying both the location of functional interactive elements and how these can be used. To achieve this, we focus on detecting and storing objects at a finer resolution, focusing on affordance-relevant parts. The primary challenge lies in the scarcity of data that extends beyond instance-level detection and the inherent difficulty of capturing detailed object features using robotic sensors. We leverage currently available 3D resources to generate 2D data and train a detector, which is then used to augment the standard 3D scene graph generation pipeline. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves functional element segmentation comparable to state-of-the-art 3D models and that our augmentation enables task-driven affordance grounding with higher accuracy than the current solutions.

      <title>A Theory of Learning with Autoregressive Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given base class of sequence-to-next-token generators, we consider learning prompt-to-answer mappings obtained by iterating a fixed, time-invariant generator for multiple steps, thus generating a chain-of-thought, and then taking the final token as the answer. We formalize the learning problems both when the chain-of-thought is observed and when training only on prompt-answer pairs, with the chain-of-thought latent. We analyze the sample and computational complexity both in terms of general properties of the base class (e.g. its VC dimension) and for specific base classes such as linear thresholds. We present a simple base class that allows for universal representability and computationally tractable chain-of-thought learning. Central to our development is that time invariance allows for sample complexity that is independent of the length of the chain-of-thought. Attention arises naturally in our construction.</description>

      <title>Learning Adaptive Dexterous Grasping from Single Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can robots learn dexterous grasping skills efficiently and apply them adaptively based on user instructions? This work tackles two key challenges: efficient skill acquisition from limited human demonstrations and context-driven skill selection. We introduce AdaDexGrasp, a framework that learns a library of grasping skills from a single human demonstration per skill and selects the most suitable one using a vision-language model (VLM). To improve sample efficiency, we propose a trajectory following reward that guides reinforcement learning (RL) toward states close to a human demonstration while allowing flexibility in exploration. To learn beyond the single demonstration, we employ curriculum learning, progressively increasing object pose variations to enhance robustness. At deployment, a VLM retrieves the appropriate skill based on user instructions, bridging low-level learned skills with high-level intent. We evaluate AdaDexGrasp in both simulation and real-world settings, showing that our approach significantly improves RL efficiency and enables learning human-like grasp strategies across varied object configurations. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of our learned policies to a real-world PSYONIC Ability Hand, with a 90% success rate across objects, significantly outperforming the baseline.</description>

      <title>Learning 3D-Gaussian Simulators from RGB Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realistic simulation is critical for applications ranging from robotics to animation. Learned simulators have emerged as a possibility to capture real world physics directly from video data, but very often require privileged information such as depth information, particle tracks and hand-engineered features to maintain spatial and temporal consistency. These strong inductive biases or ground truth 3D information help in domains where data is sparse but limit scalability and generalization in data rich regimes. To overcome the key limitations, we propose 3DGSim, a learned 3D simulator that directly learns physical interactions from multi-view RGB videos. 3DGSim unifies 3D scene reconstruction, particle dynamics prediction and video synthesis into an end-to-end trained framework. It adopts MVSplat to learn a latent particle-based representation of 3D scenes, a Point Transformer for particle dynamics, a Temporal Merging module for consistent temporal aggregation and Gaussian Splatting to produce novel view renderings. By jointly training inverse rendering and dynamics forecasting, 3DGSim embeds the physical properties into point-wise latent features. This enables the model to capture diverse physical behaviors, from rigid to elastic, cloth-like dynamics, and boundary conditions (e.g. fixed cloth corner), along with realistic lighting effects that also generalize to unseen multibody interactions and novel scene edits.</description>

      <title>$\mu$KE: Matryoshka Unstructured Knowledge Editing of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful knowledge bases yet are limited by static training data, leading to issues such as hallucinations and safety risks. Editing a model's internal knowledge through the locate-and-edit paradigm has proven a cost-effective alternative to retraining, though current unstructured approaches, especially window-based autoregressive methods, often disrupt the causal dependency between early memory updates and later output tokens. In this work, we first theoretically analyze these limitations and then introduce Matryoshka Unstructured Knowledge Editing ($\mu$KE), a novel memory update mechanism that preserves such dependencies via a Matryoshka-style objective and adaptive loss coefficients. Empirical evaluations on two models across four benchmarks demonstrate that $\mu$KE improves edit efficacy by up to 12.33% over state-of-the-art methods, and remains robust when applied to diverse formatted edits, underscoring its potential for effective unstructured knowledge editing in LLMs.</description>

      <title>How Post-Training Reshapes LLMs: A Mechanistic View on Knowledge, Truthfulness, Refusal, and Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training is essential for the success of large language models (LLMs), transforming pre-trained base models into more useful and aligned post-trained models. While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HZD01/post-training-mechanistic-analysis.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural context. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. This bidirectional and hierarchical (Bi-Hierarchical) fusion approach leverages the strengths of both modalities to capture richer and more comprehensive protein representations. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including enzyme EC classification, model quality assessment, protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, protein-protein binding site prediction, and B cell epitopes prediction. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of Bi-Hierarchical Fusion in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</description>

      <title>Sparsity Outperforms Low-Rank Projections in Few-Shot Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to new domains with few labeled samples remains a significant challenge due to severe overfitting and computational constraints. State-of-the-art solutions, such as low-rank reparameterization, mitigate these issues but often struggle with generalization and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, a novel Sparse Optimization (SO) framework is proposed. Unlike low-rank approaches that typically constrain updates to a fixed subspace, our SO method leverages high sparsity to dynamically adjust very few parameters. We introduce two key paradigms. First, we advocate for \textit{local sparsity and global density}, which updates a minimal subset of parameters per iteration while maintaining overall model expressiveness. As a second paradigm, we advocate for \textit{local randomness and global importance}, which sparsifies the gradient using random selection while pruning the first moment based on importance. This combination significantly mitigates overfitting and ensures stable adaptation in low-data regimes. Extensive experiments on 11 diverse datasets show that SO achieves state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation performance while reducing memory overhead.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for White Matter Shape Prediction in Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.</description>

      <title>Can LLM-based Financial Investing Strategies Outperform the Market in Long Run?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.</description>

      <title>Uniform Loss vs. Specialized Optimization: A Comparative Analysis in Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Specialized Multi-Task Optimizers (SMTOs) balance task learning in Multi-Task Learning by addressing issues like conflicting gradients and differing gradient norms, which hinder equal-weighted task training. However, recent critiques suggest that equally weighted tasks can achieve competitive results compared to SMTOs, arguing that previous SMTO results were influenced by poor hyperparameter optimization and lack of regularization. In this work, we evaluate these claims through an extensive empirical evaluation of SMTOs, including some of the latest methods, on more complex multi-task problems to clarify this behavior. Our findings indicate that SMTOs perform well compared to uniform loss and that fixed weights can achieve competitive performance compared to SMTOs. Furthermore, we demonstrate why uniform loss perform similarly to SMTOs in some instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/Gabriel-SGama/UnitScal_vs_SMTOs.</description>

      <title>RIDGECUT: Learning Graph Partitioning with Rings and Wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be a powerful tool for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems due to its ability to learn heuristics that can generalize across problem instances. However, integrating knowledge that will steer the RL framework for CO solutions towards domain appropriate outcomes remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose RIDGECUT, the first RL framework that constrains the action space to enforce structure-aware partitioning in the Normalized Cut problem. Using transportation networks as a motivating example, we introduce a novel concept that leverages domain knowledge about urban road topology -- where natural partitions often take the form of concentric rings and radial wedges. Our method reshapes the graph into a linear or circular structure to simplify the partitioning task so that we can apply sequential transformers and enables efficient learning via Proximal Policy Optimization. The resulting partitions are not only aligned with expected spatial layouts but also achieve lower normalized cuts compared to existing methods. While we focus on traffic data, our approach is broadly applicable and offers a mechanism for embedding structural priors into RL for graph partitioning.</description>

      <title>Extracting Probabilistic Knowledge from Large Language Models for Bayesian Network Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we evaluate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in building Bayesian Networks (BNs) by approximating domain expert priors. LLMs have demonstrated potential as factual knowledge bases; however, their capability to generate probabilistic knowledge about real-world events remains understudied. We explore utilizing the probabilistic knowledge inherent in LLMs to derive probability estimates for statements regarding events and their relationships within a BN. Using LLMs in this context allows for the parameterization of BNs, enabling probabilistic modeling within specific domains. Our experiments on eighty publicly available Bayesian Networks, from healthcare to finance, demonstrate that querying LLMs about the conditional probabilities of events provides meaningful results when compared to baselines, including random and uniform distributions, as well as approaches based on next-token generation probabilities. We explore how these LLM-derived distributions can serve as expert priors to refine distributions extracted from data, especially when data is scarce. Overall, this work introduces a promising strategy for automatically constructing Bayesian Networks by combining probabilistic knowledge extracted from LLMs with real-world data. Additionally, we establish the first comprehensive baseline for assessing LLM performance in extracting probabilistic knowledge.</description>

      <title>Improving LLM Outputs Against Jailbreak Attacks with Expert Model Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using LLMs in a production environment presents security challenges that include vulnerabilities to jailbreaks and prompt injections, which can result in harmful outputs for humans or the enterprise. The challenge is amplified when working within a specific domain, as topics generally accepted for LLMs to address may be irrelevant to that field. These problems can be mitigated, for example, by fine-tuning large language models with domain-specific and security-focused data. However, these alone are insufficient, as jailbreak techniques evolve. Additionally, API-accessed models do not offer the flexibility needed to tailor behavior to industry-specific objectives, and in-context learning is not always sufficient or reliable. In response to these challenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing between in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user inquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive industry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and out-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert model (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate responses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's intention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned, and used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can be easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we created a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the interest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark dataset to the community.</description>

      <title>FP4 All the Way: Fully Quantized Training of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, fully quantized training (FQT) of large language models (LLMs) using predominantly 4-bit floating-point (FP4) precision for weights, activations, and gradients on datasets up to 200 billion tokens. We extensively investigate key design choices for FP4, including block sizes, scaling formats, and rounding methods. Our analysis shows that the NVFP4 format, where each block of 16 FP4 values (E2M1) shares a scale represented in E4M3, provides optimal results. We use stochastic rounding for backward and update passes and round-to-nearest for the forward pass to enhance stability. Additionally, we identify a theoretical and empirical threshold for effective quantized training: when the gradient norm falls below approximately $\sqrt{3}$ times the quantization noise, quantized training becomes less effective. Leveraging these insights, we successfully train a 7-billion-parameter model on 256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators. The resulting FP4-trained model achieves downstream task performance comparable to a standard BF16 baseline, confirming that FP4 training is a practical and highly efficient approach for large-scale LLM training. A reference implementation is supplied in https://github.com/Anonymous1252022/fp4-all-the-way .</description>

      <title>CADRE: Customizable Assurance of Data Readiness in Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is a decentralized machine learning approach where multiple clients train a model collaboratively. PPFL preserves the privacy and security of a client's data without exchanging it. However, ensuring that data at each client is of high quality and ready for federated learning (FL) is a challenge due to restricted data access. In this paper, we introduce CADRE (Customizable Assurance of Data Readiness) for federated learning (FL), a novel framework that allows users to define custom data readiness (DR) metrics, rules, and remedies tailored to specific FL tasks. CADRE generates comprehensive DR reports based on the user-defined metrics, rules, and remedies to ensure datasets are prepared for FL while preserving privacy. We demonstrate a practical application of CADRE by integrating it into an existing PPFL framework. We conducted experiments across six datasets and addressed seven different DR issues. The results illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of CADRE in ensuring DR across various dimensions, including data quality, privacy, and fairness. This approach enhances the performance and reliability of FL models as well as utilizes valuable resources.</description>

      <title>MaCP: Minimal yet Mighty Adaptation via Hierarchical Cosine Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new adaptation method MaCP, Minimal yet Mighty adaptive Cosine Projection, that achieves exceptional performance while requiring minimal parameters and memory for fine-tuning large foundation models. Its general idea is to exploit the superior energy compaction and decorrelation properties of cosine projection to improve both model efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, it projects the weight change from the low-rank adaptation into the discrete cosine space. Then, the weight change is partitioned over different levels of the discrete cosine spectrum, and each partition's most critical frequency components are selected. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MaCP across a wide range of single-modality tasks, including natural language understanding, natural language generation, text summarization, as well as multi-modality tasks such as image classification and video understanding. MaCP consistently delivers superior accuracy, significantly reduced computational complexity, and lower memory requirements compared to existing alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction games has created an increasing need for intelligent frameworks where humans can collaborate with AI agents, particularly in post-pandemic contexts with heightened psychological and social pressures. Social deduction games like Werewolf, traditionally played through verbal communication, present an ideal application for Large Language Models (LLMs) given their advanced reasoning and conversational capabilities. Prior studies have shown that LLMs can outperform humans in Werewolf games, but their reliance on external modules introduces latency that left their contribution in academic domain only, and omit such game should be user-facing. We propose \textbf{Verbal Werewolf}, a novel LLM-based Werewolf game system that optimizes two parallel pipelines: gameplay powered by state-of-the-art LLMs and a fine-tuned Text-to-Speech (TTS) module that brings text output to life. Our system operates in near real-time without external decision-making modules, leveraging the enhanced reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs like DeepSeek V3 to create a more engaging and anthropomorphic gaming experience that significantly improves user engagement compared to existing text-only frameworks.</description>

      <title>HERGC: Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion for Multimodal Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs) by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. multimodal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion. Recent large language models (LLMs), empowered by massive parameter scales and pretraining on vast corpora, have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across various tasks. However, their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose HERGC, a flexible Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses a Generative LLM Predictor, implemented via either in-context learning or lightweight fine-tuning, to accurately identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and robustness, achieving superior performance over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Learning to Diagnose Privately: DP-Powered LLMs for Radiology Report Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1 score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports, addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.</description>

      <title>Leaps Beyond the Seen: Reinforced Reasoning Augmented Generation for Clinical Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to produce free-text summaries of a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being a representative long-form example. While recent LLM-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from limited patient information. In this paper, we propose ReinRAG, a reinforced reasoning augmented generation (RAG) for long-form discharge instructions based on pre-admission information. ReinRAG retrieves reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph to provide explicit semantic guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose group-based retriever optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with group-normalized rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the real-world dataset show that ReinRAG outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation metrics. Further analysis reveals that ReinRAG fills semantic gaps in sparse input scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.</description>

      <title>Winner-takes-all for Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce TimeMCL, a method leveraging the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) paradigm to forecast multiple plausible time series futures. Our approach employs a neural network with multiple heads and utilizes the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to promote diversity among predictions. MCL has recently gained attention due to its simplicity and ability to address ill-posed and ambiguous tasks. We propose an adaptation of this framework for time-series forecasting, presenting it as an efficient method to predict diverse futures, which we relate to its implicit quantization objective. We provide insights into our approach using synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world time series, demonstrating its promising performance at a light computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This case study describes challenges and lessons learned on building Ocean Guard: a Machine Learning-Enabled System (MLES) for anomaly detection in the maritime domain. First, the paper presents the system's specification, and architecture. Ocean Guard was designed with a microservices' architecture to enable multiple teams to work on the project in parallel. Then, the paper discusses how the developers adapted contract-based design to MLOps for achieving that goal. As a MLES, Ocean Guard employs code, model, and data contracts to establish guidelines between its services. This case study hopes to inspire software engineers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists to leverage similar approaches for their systems.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Compromises for Coalition Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo, using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where traditional tools are limited.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Teleconnection-Aware Transformer for Global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions from several weeks to months in advance, represents a critical frontier for agricultural planning, energy management, and disaster preparedness. However, it remains one of the most challenging problems in atmospheric science, due to the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We introduce \textbf{TelePiT}, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical global climate interactions through explicitly modeling teleconnection patterns into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{TelePiT} significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and operational numerical weather prediction systems across all forecast horizons, marking a significant advance toward reliable S2S forecasting.</description>

      <title>A Two-stage Optimization Method for Wide-range Single-electron Quantum Magnetic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum magnetic sensing based on spin systems has emerged as a new paradigm for detecting ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity, revitalizing applications in navigation, geo-localization, biology, and beyond. At the heart of quantum magnetic sensing, from the protocol perspective, lies the design of optimal sensing parameters to manifest and then estimate the underlying signals of interest (SoI). Existing studies on this front mainly rely on adaptive algorithms based on black-box AI models or formula-driven principled searches. However, when the SoI spans a wide range and the quantum sensor has physical constraints, these methods may fail to converge efficiently or optimally, resulting in prolonged interrogation times and reduced sensing accuracy. In this work, we report the design of a new protocol using a two-stage optimization method. In the 1st Stage, a Bayesian neural network with a fixed set of sensing parameters is used to narrow the range of SoI. In the 2nd Stage, a federated reinforcement learning agent is designed to fine-tune the sensing parameters within a reduced search space. The proposed protocol is developed and evaluated in a challenging context of single-shot readout of an NV-center electron spin under a constrained total sensing time budget; and yet it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and resource efficiency for wide-range D.C. magnetic field estimation compared to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>MMET: A Multi-Input and Multi-Scale Transformer for Efficient PDEs Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs. This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer (MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE) layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains.

      <title>DRAMA-X: A Fine-grained Intent Prediction and Risk Reasoning Benchmark For Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline. DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores, expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection, intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment, especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.</description>

      <title>Granular-Ball-Induced Multiple Kernel K-Means</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally, the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises. Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical evaluation of various clustering tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Behavior Cloning Via Global Lipschitz Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles. BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances. Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across various environments in Gymnasium.

      <description>arXiv:2506.19877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying suitable machine learning paradigms for intrusion detection remains critical for building effective and generalizable security solutions. In this study, we present a controlled comparison of four representative models - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) - on the CICIDS2017 dataset under two scenarios: detecting known attack types and generalizing to previously unseen threats. Our results show that supervised MLP and CNN achieve near-perfect accuracy on familiar attacks but suffer drastic recall drops on novel attacks. Unsupervised LOF attains moderate overall accuracy and high recall on unknown threats at the cost of elevated false alarms, while boundary-based OCSVM balances precision and recall best, demonstrating robust detection across both scenarios. These findings offer practical guidance for selecting IDS models in dynamic network environments.</description>

      <title>CycleDistill: Bootstrapping Machine Translation using LLMs with Cyclical Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT). However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems. CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora, it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.</description>

      <title>Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size, are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres: Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze computational resource requirements across different adapter scales, demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher redundancy in their generations.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based personalization.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Optimality for Inference-time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, providing the first principled guidance for compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop OptScale, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses. OptScale employs a language model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC) demonstrate that OptScale significantly reduces sampling overhead while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance. Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

      <title>Foundation versus Domain-specific Models: Performance Comparison, Fusion, and Explainability in Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, GPT-4o, Grok-4) compare against a domain-specific face recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task? Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and benchmark datasets, we report the following findings: (a) In all face benchmark datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improved on over-segmented face images compared to tightly cropped faces, thereby suggesting the importance of contextual clues. (c) A simple score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific face recognition model improved the accuracy at low false match rates. (d) Foundation models, such as GPT-4o and Grok-4, are able to provide explainability to the face recognition pipeline. In some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence decisions made by AdaFace, thereby reiterating the importance of combining domain-specific face recognition models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.</description>

      <title>Addressing The Devastating Effects Of Single-Task Data Poisoning In Exemplar-Free Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our research addresses the overlooked security concerns related to data poisoning in continual learning (CL). Data poisoning - the intentional manipulation of training data to affect the predictions of machine learning models - was recently shown to be a threat to CL training stability. While existing literature predominantly addresses scenario-dependent attacks, we propose to focus on a more simple and realistic single-task poison (STP) threats. In contrast to previously proposed poisoning settings, in STP adversaries lack knowledge and access to the model, as well as to both previous and future tasks. During an attack, they only have access to the current task within the data stream. Our study demonstrates that even within these stringent conditions, adversaries can compromise model performance using standard image corruptions. We show that STP attacks are able to strongly disrupt the whole continual training process: decreasing both the stability (its performance on past tasks) and plasticity (capacity to adapt to new tasks) of the algorithm. Finally, we propose a high-level defense framework for CL along with a poison task detection method based on task vectors. The code is available at https://github.com/stapaw/STP.git .</description>

      <title>LIRA: Inferring Segmentation in Large Multi-modal Models with Local Interleaved Region Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations: inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2) Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks, offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with the latent related semantics of the &lt;seg&gt; token. To quantify this relationship and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.</description>

      <title>Speckle2Self: Self-Supervised Ultrasound Speckle Reduction Without Clean Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead, US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales, while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness, Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and adaptability to images from unseen domains.

      <title>Bridging the Last Mile of Prediction: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Guided Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing generative models for time series forecasting often transform simple priors (typically Gaussian) into complex data distributions. However, their sampling initialization, independent of historical data, hinders the capture of temporal dependencies, limiting predictive accuracy. They also treat residuals merely as optimization targets, ignoring that residuals often exhibit meaningful patterns like systematic biases or nontrivial distributional structures. To address these, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM), a novel model-agnostic framework that extends flow matching by integrating outputs from an auxiliary predictive model. This enables learning from the probabilistic structure of prediction residuals, leveraging the auxiliary model's prediction distribution as a source to reduce learning difficulty and refine forecasts. CGFM incorporates historical data as both conditions and guidance, uses two-sided conditional paths (with source and target conditioned on the same history), and employs affine paths to expand the path space, avoiding path crossing without complex mechanisms, preserving temporal consistency, and strengthening distribution alignment. Experiments across datasets and baselines show CGFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, advancing forecasting.</description>

      <title>AMix-1: A Pathway to Test-Time Scalable Protein Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce AMix-1, a powerful protein foundation model built on Bayesian Flow Networks and empowered by a systematic training methodology, encompassing pretraining scaling laws, emergent capability analysis, in-context learning mechanism, and test-time scaling algorithm. To guarantee robust scalability, we establish a predictive scaling law and reveal the progressive emergence of structural understanding via loss perspective, culminating in a strong 1.7-billion model. Building on this foundation, we devise a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)-based in-context learning strategy to unify protein design into a general framework, where AMix-1 recognizes deep evolutionary signals among MSAs and consistently generates structurally and functionally coherent proteins. This framework enables the successful design of a dramatically improved AmeR variant with an up to $50\times$ activity increase over its wild type. Pushing the boundaries of protein engineering, we further empower AMix-1 with an evolutionary test-time scaling algorithm for in silico directed evolution that delivers substantial, scalable performance gains as verification budgets are intensified, laying the groundwork for next-generation lab-in-the-loop protein design.</description>

      <title>RAPNet: A Receptive-Field Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network for Pansharpening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.</description>

      <title>SystolicAttention: Fusing FlashAttention within a Single Systolic Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models rely heavily on scaled dot-product attention (SDPA), typically implemented using the FlashAttention algorithm. However, current systolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing FlashAttention. Systolic arrays achieve high utilization primarily for consecutive and large matrix multiplications, whereas FlashAttention requires frequent interleaving of matrix multiplications and softmax operations.
  The frequent data swaps between matrix multiplications on the systolic array and softmax operations on external units result in low array utilization. Moreover, when these computations run concurrently, the softmax stage contends with matrix multiplication for register file and SRAM ports, further degrading performance.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array architecture that enables the FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely within a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units. At the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps FlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise overlap. This approach significantly improves array utilization while preserving the original floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.
  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art commercial accelerators. Our results show that FSA achieves 1.77 and 4.83 times higher attention FLOPs/s utilization compared to AWS Neuron v2 and Google TPUv5e, respectively, with only 12% area overhead.</description>

      <title>Are Vision Foundation Models Ready for Out-of-the-Box Medical Image Registration?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial. Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM, MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure accuracy. We also publicly release our code at \href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.</description>

      <title>Learning Phonetic Context-Dependent Viseme for Enhancing Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D facial animation.

      <title>aLLoyM: A large language model for alloy phase diagram prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are general-purpose tools with wide-ranging applications, including in materials science. In this work, we introduce aLLoyM, a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained on alloy compositions, temperatures, and their corresponding phase information. To develop aLLoyM, we curated question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) pairs for binary and ternary phase diagrams using the open-source Computational Phase Diagram Database (CPDDB) and assessments based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). We fine-tuned Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&amp;A formats: multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials systems. To promote further research and adoption, we have publicly released the short-answer fine-tuned version of aLLoyM, along with the complete benchmarking Q&amp;A dataset, on Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>A Bit of Freedom Goes a Long Way: Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning under a Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time, freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al. (arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the $O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret, exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise all of our results to compact state spaces.</description>

      <title>A novel language model for predicting serious adverse event results in clinical trials from their prospective registrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical trials could be better designed and monitored. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event (SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analyzed 22,107 two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier predicting whether a greater proportion of participants in an experimental arm would have SAEs (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; AUC) compared to the control arm, and a regression model to predict the proportion of participants with SAEs in the control arms (root mean squared error; RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g., ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with a downstream model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts exceeding localized language model input limits, a sliding window method was developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model (ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC when predicting which trial arm had a higher proportion of SAEs. When predicting SAE proportion in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed direct comparisons. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%, and absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58% across 12 regressors. Discussion: Summary results data from ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilized. Predicted results of publicly reported trials provides an opportunity to identify discrepancies between expected and reported safety results.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Robot-Assisted Surgery with Hierarchical Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</description>

      <title>SpectrumFM: Redefining Spectrum Cognition via Foundation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification (WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.</description>

      <title>HiTeC: Hierarchical Contrastive Learning on Text-Attributed Hypergraph with Semantic-Aware Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels. However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology, resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap, we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of HiTeC.</description>

      <title>When Cars Have Stereotypes: Auditing Demographic Bias in Objects from Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories. Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.</description>

      <title>LLMDistill4Ads: Using Cross-Encoders to Distill from LLM Signals for Advertiser Keyphrase Recommendations at eBay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions. Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.</description>

      <title>DS$^2$Net: Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>RCR-Router: Efficient Role-Aware Context Routing for Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Structured Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM systems.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Dysarthric Speech Synthesis: Understanding Intrinsic Bias in Dysarthric Speech Cloning using F5-TTS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dysarthric speech poses significant challenges in developing assistive technologies, primarily due to the limited availability of data. Recent advances in neural speech synthesis, especially zero-shot voice cloning, facilitate synthetic speech generation for data augmentation; however, they may introduce biases towards dysarthric speech. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech technologies.</description>

      <title>FDC-Net: Rethinking the association between EEG artifact removal and multi-dimensional affective computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition holds significant value in affective computing and brain-computer interfaces. However, in practical applications, EEG recordings are susceptible to the effects of various physiological artifacts. Current approaches typically treat denoising and emotion recognition as independent tasks using cascaded architectures, which not only leads to error accumulation, but also fails to exploit potential synergies between these tasks. Moreover, conventional EEG-based emotion recognition models often rely on the idealized assumption of "perfectly denoised data", lacking a systematic design for noise robustness. To address these challenges, a novel framework that deeply couples denoising and emotion recognition tasks is proposed for end-to-end noise-robust emotion recognition, termed as Feedback-Driven Collaborative Network for Denoising-Classification Nexus (FDC-Net). Our primary innovation lies in establishing a dynamic collaborative mechanism between artifact removal and emotion recognition through: (1) bidirectional gradient propagation with joint optimization strategies; (2) a gated attention mechanism integrated with frequency-adaptive Transformer using learnable band-position encoding. Two most popular EEG-based emotion datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels were employed to compare the artifact removal and emotion recognition performance between FDC-Net and nine state-of-the-art methods. In terms of the denoising task, FDC-Net obtains a maximum correlation coefficient (CC) value of 96.30% on DEAP and a maximum CC value of 90.31% on DREAMER. In terms of the emotion recognition task under physiological artifact interference, FDC-Net achieves emotion recognition accuracies of 82.3+7.1% on DEAP and 88.1+0.8% on DREAMER.</description>

      <title>Echo: Decoupling Inference and Training for Large-Scale RL Alignment on Heterogeneous Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and "training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes policy weights according to API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to maximise hardware utilisation. Training four representative RL workloads with Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster, Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware. These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.</description>

      <title>LAG: Logic-Augmented Generation from a Cartesian Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from \textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically, LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to existing RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Fourier-VLM: Compressing Vision Tokens in the Frequency Domain for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image placeholder token (&lt;image&gt;) in textual instructions with visual features from an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM). However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$, minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2% compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.</description>

Abstract: Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases. Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.</description>
