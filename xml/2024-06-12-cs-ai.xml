      <title>LLM-Enhanced Bayesian Optimization for Efficient Analog Layout Constraint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog layout synthesis faces significant challenges due to its dependence on manual processes, considerable time requirements, and performance instability. Current Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based techniques for analog layout synthesis, despite their potential for automation, suffer from slow convergence and extensive data needs, limiting their practical application. This paper presents the \texttt{LLANA} framework, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance BO by exploiting the few-shot learning abilities of LLMs for more efficient generation of analog design-dependent parameter constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{LLANA} not only achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) BO methods but also enables a more effective exploration of the analog circuit design space, thanks to LLM's superior contextual understanding and learning efficiency. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/dekura/LLANA}.</description>

      <title>M3GIA: A Cognition Inspired Multilingual and Multimodal General Intelligence Ability Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As recent multi-modality large language models (MLLMs) have shown formidable proficiency on various complex tasks, there has been increasing attention on debating whether these models could eventually mirror human intelligence. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating solely on task performance, such as the accuracy of identifying the attribute of an object. Combining well-developed cognitive science to understand the intelligence of MLLMs beyond superficial achievements remains largely unexplored. To this end, we introduce the first cognitive-driven multi-lingual and multi-modal benchmark to evaluate the general intelligence ability of MLLMs, dubbed M3GIA. Specifically, we identify five key cognitive factors based on the well-recognized Cattell-Horn-Carrol (CHC) model of intelligence and propose a novel evaluation metric. In addition, since most MLLMs are trained to perform in different languages, a natural question arises: is language a key factor influencing the cognitive ability of MLLMs? As such, we go beyond English to encompass other languages based on their popularity, including Chinese, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Korean, to construct our M3GIA. We make sure all the data relevant to the cultural backgrounds are collected from their native context to avoid English-centric bias. We collected a significant corpus of data from human participants, revealing that the most advanced MLLM reaches the lower boundary of human intelligence in English. Yet, there remains a pronounced disparity in the other five languages assessed. We also reveals an interesting winner takes all phenomenon that are aligned with the discovery in cognitive studies. Our benchmark will be open-sourced, with the aspiration of facilitating the enhancement of cognitive capabilities in MLLMs.</description>

      <title>LEMMA-RCA: A Large Multi-modal Multi-domain Dataset for Root Cause Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) is crucial for enhancing the reliability and performance of complex systems. However, progress in this field has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, open-source datasets tailored for RCA. To bridge this gap, we introduce LEMMA-RCA, a large dataset designed for diverse RCA tasks across multiple domains and modalities. LEMMA-RCA features various real-world fault scenarios from IT and OT operation systems, encompassing microservices, water distribution, and water treatment systems, with hundreds of system entities involved. We evaluate the quality of LEMMA-RCA by testing the performance of eight baseline methods on this dataset under various settings, including offline and online modes as well as single and multiple modalities. Our experimental results demonstrate the high quality of LEMMA-RCA. The dataset is publicly available at https://lemma-rca.github.io/.</description>

      <title>MLLM-SR: Conversational Symbolic Regression base Multi-Modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulas are the language of communication between humans and nature. It is an important research topic of artificial intelligence to find expressions from observed data to reflect the relationship between each variable in the data, which is called a symbolic regression problem. The existing symbolic regression methods directly generate expressions according to the given observation data, and we cannot require the algorithm to generate expressions that meet specific requirements according to the known prior knowledge. For example, the expression needs to contain $\sin$ or be symmetric, and so on. Even if it can, it often requires very complex operations, which is very inconvenient. In this paper, based on multi-modal large language models, we propose MLLM-SR, a conversational symbolic regression method that can generate expressions that meet the requirements simply by describing the requirements with natural language instructions. By experimenting on the Nguyen dataset, we can demonstrate that MLLM-SR leads the state-of-the-art baselines in fitting performance. More notably, we experimentally demonstrate that MLLM-SR can well understand the prior knowledge we add to the natural language instructions. Moreover, the addition of prior knowledge can effectively guide MLLM-SR to generate correct expressions.</description>

      <title>Multi-attribute Auction-based Resource Allocation for Twins Migration in Vehicular Metaverses: A GPT-based DRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular Metaverses are developed to enhance the modern automotive industry with an immersive and safe experience among connected vehicles and roadside infrastructures, e.g., RoadSide Units (RSUs). For seamless synchronization with virtual spaces, Vehicle Twins (VTs) are constructed as digital representations of physical entities. However, resource-intensive VTs updating and high mobility of vehicles require intensive computation, communication, and storage resources, especially for their migration among RSUs with limited coverages. To address these issues, we propose an attribute-aware auction-based mechanism to optimize resource allocation during VTs migration by considering both price and non-monetary attributes, e.g., location and reputation. In this mechanism, we propose a two-stage matching for vehicular users and Metaverse service providers in multi-attribute resource markets. First, the resource attributes matching algorithm obtains the resource attributes perfect matching, namely, buyers and sellers can participate in a double Dutch auction (DDA). Then, we train a DDA auctioneer using a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to adjust the auction clocks efficiently during the auction process. We compare the performance of social welfare and auction information exchange costs with state-of-the-art baselines under different settings. Simulation results show that our proposed GPT-based DRL auction schemes have better performance than others.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic UAV-assisted Vehicle Twins Migration in Vehicular Metaverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-ground integrated networks can relieve communication pressure on ground transportation networks and provide 6G-enabled vehicular Metaverses services offloading in remote areas with sparse RoadSide Units (RSUs) coverage and downtown areas where users have a high demand for vehicular services. Vehicle Twins (VTs) are the digital twins of physical vehicles to enable more immersive and realistic vehicular services, which can be offloaded and updated on RSU, to manage and provide vehicular Metaverses services to passengers and drivers. The high mobility of vehicles and the limited coverage of RSU signals necessitate VT migration to ensure service continuity when vehicles leave the signal coverage of RSUs. However, uneven VT task migration might overload some RSUs, which might result in increased service latency, and thus impactive immersive experiences for users. In this paper, we propose a dynamic Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted VT migration framework in air-ground integrated networks, where UAVs act as aerial edge servers to assist ground RSUs during VT task offloading. In this framework, we propose a diffusion-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, which can efficiently make immersive VT migration decisions in UAV-assisted vehicular networks. To balance the workload of RSUs and improve VT migration quality, we design a novel dynamic path planning algorithm based on a heuristic search strategy for UAVs. Simulation results show that the diffusion-based RL algorithm with UAV-assisted performs better than other baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Near-Optimal Conformance Checking Approach for Long Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long traces and large event logs that originate from sensors and prediction models are becoming more common in our data-rich world. In such circumstances, conformance checking, a key task in process mining, can become computationally infeasible due to the exponential complexity of finding an optimal alignment.
  This paper introduces a novel sliding window approach to address these scalability challenges while preserving the interpretability of alignment-based methods. By breaking down traces into manageable subtraces and iteratively aligning each with the process model, our method significantly reduces the search space.
  The approach uses global information that captures structural properties of the trace and the process model to make informed alignment decisions, discarding unpromising alignments even if they are optimal for a local subtrace. This improves the overall accuracy of the results.
  Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method consistently finds optimal alignments in most cases and highlight its scalability. This is further supported by a theoretical complexity analysis, which shows the reduced growth of the search space compared to other common conformance checking methods.
  This work provides a valuable contribution towards efficient conformance checking for large-scale process mining applications.</description>

      <title>Towards a Benchmark for Causal Business Process Reasoning with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for boosting organizational efficiency and automating tasks. While not originally designed for complex cognitive processes, recent efforts have further extended to employ LLMs in activities such as reasoning, planning, and decision-making. In business processes, such abilities could be invaluable for leveraging on the massive corpora LLMs have been trained on for gaining deep understanding of such processes. In this work, we plant the seeds for the development of a benchmark to assess the ability of LLMs to reason about causal and process perspectives of business operations. We refer to this view as Causally-augmented Business Processes (BP^C). The core of the benchmark comprises a set of BP^C related situations, a set of questions about these situations, and a set of deductive rules employed to systematically resolve the ground truth answers to these questions. Also with the power of LLMs, the seed is then instantiated into a larger-scale set of domain-specific situations and questions. Reasoning on BP^C is of crucial importance for process interventions and process improvement. Our benchmark could be used in one of two possible modalities: testing the performance of any target LLM and training an LLM to advance its capability to reason about BP^C.</description>

      <title>Online DPO: Online Direct Preference Optimization with Fast-Slow Chasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improves the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values by training directly on human preference datasets, eliminating the need for reward models. However, due to the presence of cross-domain human preferences, direct continual training can lead to catastrophic forgetting, limiting DPO's performance and efficiency. Inspired by intraspecific competition driving species evolution, we propose a Online Fast-Slow chasing DPO (OFS-DPO) for preference alignment, simulating competition through fast and slow chasing among models to facilitate rapid adaptation. Specifically, we first derive the regret upper bound for online learning, validating our motivation with a min-max optimization pattern. Based on this, we introduce two identical modules using Low-rank Adaptive (LoRA) with different optimization speeds to simulate intraspecific competition, and propose a new regularization term to guide their learning. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting in cross-domain scenarios, we extend the OFS-DPO with LoRA modules combination strategy, resulting in the Cross domain Online Fast-Slow chasing DPO (COFS-DPO). This method leverages linear combinations of fast modules parameters from different task domains, fully utilizing historical information to achive continual value alignment. Experimental results show that OFS-DPO outperforms DPO in in-domain alignment, while COFS-DPO excels in cross-domain continual learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Flow of Reasoning: Efficient Training of LLM Policy with Divergent Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divergent thinking, the cognitive process of generating diverse solutions, is a hallmark of human creativity and problem-solving. For machines, sampling diverse solution trajectories in complex reasoning problems is crucial for robust outcomes, data augmentation, and enhanced model generalization. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with generating high-quality, diverse reasoning. While supervised fine-tuning helps with quality, it requires extensive supervision data to capture the full diversity of solutions. Alternatively, reinforcement learning methods like PPO aim to find limited highest-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity, akin to convergent thinking. To address these limitations, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR) -- an efficient LLM training approach enabling diverse reasoning with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow from an initial state to terminal states. The formulation allows to adapt principled GFlowNet approaches to train the LLM as a policy, which is able to sample multiple reasoning paths with probabilities proportional to the unnormalized reward. Empirical results show that, with limited training data (e.g., 15 examples), FoR can discover diverse high-quality solutions that excel greatly beyond current state-of-the-art methods across three tasks, including embodied reasoning (BlocksWorld), math puzzle solving (Game24), and logical reasoning (PrOntoQA). Code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Fangxu/FoR.</description>

      <title>VillagerAgent: A Graph-Based Multi-Agent Framework for Coordinating Complex Task Dependencies in Minecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to evaluate multi-agent systems against complex dependencies, including spatial, causal, and temporal constraints. First, we construct a new benchmark, named VillagerBench, within the Minecraft environment.VillagerBench comprises diverse tasks crafted to test various aspects of multi-agent collaboration, from workload distribution to dynamic adaptation and synchronized task execution. Second, we introduce a Directed Acyclic Graph Multi-Agent Framework VillagerAgent to resolve complex inter-agent dependencies and enhance collaborative efficiency. This solution incorporates a task decomposer that creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for structured task management, an agent controller for task distribution, and a state manager for tracking environmental and agent data. Our empirical evaluation on VillagerBench demonstrates that VillagerAgent outperforms the existing AgentVerse model, reducing hallucinations and improving task decomposition efficacy. The results underscore VillagerAgent's potential in advancing multi-agent collaboration, offering a scalable and generalizable solution in dynamic environments. The source code is open-source on GitHub (https://github.com/cnsdqd-dyb/VillagerAgent).</description>

      <title>Methodology and Real-World Applications of Dynamic Uncertain Causality Graph for Clinical Diagnosis with Explainability and Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-aided clinical diagnosis is desired in medical care. Existing deep learning models lack explainability and mainly focus on image analysis. The recently developed Dynamic Uncertain Causality Graph (DUCG) approach is causality-driven, explainable, and invariant across different application scenarios, without problems of data collection, labeling, fitting, privacy, bias, generalization, high cost and high energy consumption. Through close collaboration between clinical experts and DUCG technicians, 46 DUCG models covering 54 chief complaints were constructed. Over 1,000 diseases can be diagnosed without triage. Before being applied in real-world, the 46 DUCG models were retrospectively verified by third-party hospitals. The verified diagnostic precisions were no less than 95%, in which the diagnostic precision for every disease including uncommon ones was no less than 80%. After verifications, the 46 DUCG models were applied in the real-world in China. Over one million real diagnosis cases have been performed, with only 17 incorrect diagnoses identified. Due to DUCG's transparency, the mistakes causing the incorrect diagnoses were found and corrected. The diagnostic abilities of the clinicians who applied DUCG frequently were improved significantly. Following the introduction to the earlier presented DUCG methodology, the recommendation algorithm for potential medical checks is presented and the key idea of DUCG is extracted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent rapid development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has indicated their potential for embodied tasks.However, the critical skill of spatial understanding in embodied environments has not been thoroughly evaluated, leaving the gap between current LVLMs and qualified embodied intelligence unknown. Therefore, we construct EmbSpatial-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating embodied spatial understanding of LVLMs.The benchmark is automatically derived from embodied scenes and covers 6 spatial relationships from an egocentric perspective.Experiments expose the insufficient capacity of current LVLMs (even GPT-4V). We further present EmbSpatial-SFT, an instruction-tuning dataset designed to improve LVLMs' embodied spatial understanding.</description>

      <title>Global Sensitivity Analysis of Uncertain Parameters in Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, the sensitivity analysis of a Bayesian network studies the impact of individually modifying the entries of its conditional probability tables in a one-at-a-time (OAT) fashion. However, this approach fails to give a comprehensive account of each inputs' relevance, since simultaneous perturbations in two or more parameters often entail higher-order effects that cannot be captured by an OAT analysis. We propose to conduct global variance-based sensitivity analysis instead, whereby $n$ parameters are viewed as uncertain at once and their importance is assessed jointly. Our method works by encoding the uncertainties as $n$ additional variables of the network. To prevent the curse of dimensionality while adding these dimensions, we use low-rank tensor decomposition to break down the new potentials into smaller factors. Last, we apply the method of Sobol to the resulting network to obtain $n$ global sensitivity indices. Using a benchmark array of both expert-elicited and learned Bayesian networks, we demonstrate that the Sobol indices can significantly differ from the OAT indices, thus revealing the true influence of uncertain parameters and their interactions.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed the development of sophisticated agentic workflows, offering improvements over traditional single-path, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques. This survey summarize the common workflows, with the particular focus on LLM-Profiled Components (LMPCs) and ignorance of non-LLM components. The reason behind such exploration is to facilitate a clearer understanding of LLM roles and see how reusabile of the LMPCs.</description>

      <title>Aligning Large Language Models with Representation Editing: A Control Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human objectives is crucial for real-world applications. However, fine-tuning LLMs for alignment often suffers from unstable training and requires substantial computing resources. Test-time alignment techniques, such as prompting and guided decoding, do not modify the underlying model, and their performance remains dependent on the original model's capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose aligning LLMs through representation editing. The core of our method is to view a pre-trained autoregressive LLM as a discrete-time stochastic dynamical system. To achieve alignment for specific objectives, we introduce external control signals into the state space of this language dynamical system. We train a value function directly on the hidden states according to the Bellman equation, enabling gradient-based optimization to obtain the optimal control signals at test time. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing test-time alignment techniques while requiring significantly fewer resources compared to fine-tuning methods.</description>

      <title>Decision-Making Behavior Evaluation Framework for LLMs under Uncertain Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When making decisions under uncertainty, individuals often deviate from rational behavior, which can be evaluated across three dimensions: risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion. Given the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) in decision-making processes, it is crucial to assess whether their behavior aligns with human norms and ethical expectations or exhibits potential biases. Several empirical studies have investigated the rationality and social behavior performance of LLMs, yet their internal decision-making tendencies and capabilities remain inadequately understood. This paper proposes a framework, grounded in behavioral economics, to evaluate the decision-making behaviors of LLMs. Through a multiple-choice-list experiment, we estimate the degree of risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion in a context-free setting for three commercial LLMs: ChatGPT-4.0-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.0-pro. Our results reveal that LLMs generally exhibit patterns similar to humans, such as risk aversion and loss aversion, with a tendency to overweight small probabilities. However, there are significant variations in the degree to which these behaviors are expressed across different LLMs. We also explore their behavior when embedded with socio-demographic features, uncovering significant disparities. For instance, when modeled with attributes of sexual minority groups or physical disabilities, Claude-3-Opus displays increased risk aversion, leading to more conservative choices. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications and potential biases in deploying LLMs in decision-making scenarios. Therefore, this study advocates for developing standards and guidelines to ensure that LLMs operate within ethical boundaries while enhancing their utility in complex decision-making environments.</description>

      <title>On the Utility of Accounting for Human Beliefs about AI Behavior in Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable effective human-AI collaboration, merely optimizing AI performance while ignoring humans is not sufficient. Recent research has demonstrated that designing AI agents to account for human behavior leads to improved performance in human-AI collaboration. However, a limitation of most existing approaches is their assumption that human behavior is static, irrespective of AI behavior. In reality, humans may adjust their action plans based on their observations of AI behavior. In this paper, we address this limitation by enabling a collaborative AI agent to consider the beliefs of its human partner, i.e., what the human partner thinks the AI agent is doing, and design its action plan to facilitate easier collaboration with its human partner. Specifically, we developed a model of human beliefs that accounts for how humans reason about the behavior of their AI partners. Based on this belief model, we then developed an AI agent that considers both human behavior and human beliefs in devising its strategy for working with humans. Through extensive real-world human-subject experiments, we demonstrated that our belief model more accurately predicts humans' beliefs about AI behavior. Moreover, we showed that our design of AI agents that accounts for human beliefs enhances performance in human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>EXPIL: Explanatory Predicate Invention for Learning in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be a powerful tool for training agents that excel in various games. However, the black-box nature of neural network models often hinders our ability to understand the reasoning behind the agent's actions. Recent research has attempted to address this issue by using the guidance of pretrained neural agents to encode logic-based policies, allowing for interpretable decisions. A drawback of such approaches is the requirement of large amounts of predefined background knowledge in the form of predicates, limiting its applicability and scalability. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Explanatory Predicate Invention for Learning in Games (EXPIL), that identifies and extracts predicates from a pretrained neural agent, later used in the logic-based agents, reducing the dependency on predefined background knowledge. Our experimental evaluation on various games demonstrate the effectiveness of EXPIL in achieving explainable behavior in logic agents while requiring less background knowledge.</description>

      <title>Deep Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Utility-Based Infrastructural Maintenance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Multi-Objective Deep Centralized Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MO- DCMAC), a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) method for infrastructural maintenance optimization, an area traditionally dominated by single-objective reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Previous single-objective RL methods combine multiple objectives, such as probability of collapse and cost, into a singular reward signal through reward-shaping. In contrast, MO-DCMAC can optimize a policy for multiple objectives directly, even when the utility function is non-linear. We evaluated MO-DCMAC using two utility functions, which use probability of collapse and cost as input. The first utility function is the Threshold utility, in which MO-DCMAC should minimize cost so that the probability of collapse is never above the threshold. The second is based on the Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) methodology used by asset managers to asses maintenance plans. We evaluated MO-DCMAC, with both utility functions, in multiple maintenance environments, including ones based on a case study of the historical quay walls of Amsterdam. The performance of MO-DCMAC was compared against multiple rule-based policies based on heuristics currently used for constructing maintenance plans. Our results demonstrate that MO-DCMAC outperforms traditional rule-based policies across various environments and utility functions.</description>

      <title>A Large Language Model Pipeline for Breast Cancer Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in the innovation of many disciplines. However, how they can best be developed for oncology remains underdeveloped. State-of-the-art OpenAI models were fine-tuned on a clinical dataset and clinical guidelines text corpus for two important cancer treatment factors, adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy, using a novel Langchain prompt engineering pipeline. A high accuracy (0.85+) was achieved in the classification of adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy for breast cancer patients. Furthermore, a confidence interval was formed from observational data on the quality of treatment from human oncologists to estimate the proportion of scenarios in which the model must outperform the original oncologist in its treatment prediction to be a better solution overall as 8.2% to 13.3%. Due to indeterminacy in the outcomes of cancer treatment decisions, future investigation, potentially a clinical trial, would be required to determine if this threshold was met by the models. Nevertheless, with 85% of U.S. cancer patients receiving treatment at local community facilities, these kinds of models could play an important part in expanding access to quality care with outcomes that lie, at minimum, close to a human oncologist.</description>

      <title>Transforming Wearable Data into Health Insights using Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the proliferation of wearable health trackers and the importance of sleep and exercise to health, deriving actionable personalized insights from wearable data remains a challenge because doing so requires non-trivial open-ended analysis of these data. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) agents, which can use tools to reason about and interact with the world, presents a promising opportunity to enable such personalized analysis at scale. Yet, the application of LLM agents in analyzing personal health is still largely untapped. In this paper, we introduce the Personal Health Insights Agent (PHIA), an agent system that leverages state-of-the-art code generation and information retrieval tools to analyze and interpret behavioral health data from wearables. We curate two benchmark question-answering datasets of over 4000 health insights questions. Based on 650 hours of human and expert evaluation we find that PHIA can accurately address over 84% of factual numerical questions and more than 83% of crowd-sourced open-ended questions. This work has implications for advancing behavioral health across the population, potentially enabling individuals to interpret their own wearable data, and paving the way for a new era of accessible, personalized wellness regimens that are informed by data-driven insights.</description>

      <title>Husky: A Unified, Open-Source Language Agent for Multi-Step Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language agents perform complex tasks by using tools to execute each step precisely. However, most existing agents are based on proprietary models or designed to target specific tasks, such as mathematics or multi-hop question answering. We introduce Husky, a holistic, open-source language agent that learns to reason over a unified action space to address a diverse set of complex tasks involving numerical, tabular, and knowledge-based reasoning. Husky iterates between two stages: 1) generating the next action to take towards solving a given task and 2) executing the action using expert models and updating the current solution state. We identify a thorough ontology of actions for addressing complex tasks and curate high-quality data to train expert models for executing these actions. Our experiments show that Husky outperforms prior language agents across 14 evaluation datasets. Moreover, we introduce HuskyQA, a new evaluation set which stress tests language agents for mixed-tool reasoning, with a focus on retrieving missing knowledge and performing numerical reasoning. Despite using 7B models, Husky matches or even exceeds frontier LMs such as GPT-4 on these tasks, showcasing the efficacy of our holistic approach in addressing complex reasoning problems. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/agent-husky/Husky-v1.</description>

      <title>Towards a Personal Health Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In health, most large language model (LLM) research has focused on clinical tasks. However, mobile and wearable devices, which are rarely integrated into such tasks, provide rich, longitudinal data for personal health monitoring. Here we present Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), fine-tuned from Gemini for understanding and reasoning over numerical time-series personal health data. We created and curated three datasets that test 1) production of personalized insights and recommendations from sleep patterns, physical activity, and physiological responses, 2) expert domain knowledge, and 3) prediction of self-reported sleep outcomes. For the first task we designed 857 case studies in collaboration with domain experts to assess real-world scenarios in sleep and fitness. Through comprehensive evaluation of domain-specific rubrics, we observed that Gemini Ultra 1.0 and PH-LLM are not statistically different from expert performance in fitness and, while experts remain superior for sleep, fine-tuning PH-LLM provided significant improvements in using relevant domain knowledge and personalizing information for sleep insights. We evaluated PH-LLM domain knowledge using multiple choice sleep medicine and fitness examinations. PH-LLM achieved 79% on sleep and 88% on fitness, exceeding average scores from a sample of human experts. Finally, we trained PH-LLM to predict self-reported sleep quality outcomes from textual and multimodal encoding representations of wearable data, and demonstrate that multimodal encoding is required to match performance of specialized discriminative models. Although further development and evaluation are necessary in the safety-critical personal health domain, these results demonstrate both the broad knowledge and capabilities of Gemini models and the benefit of contextualizing physiological data for personal health applications as done with PH-LLM.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Opponent Policy Detection in Multi-Agent MDPs: Real-Time Strategy Switch Identification Using Running Error Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), accurately perceiving opponents' strategies is essential for both cooperative and adversarial contexts, particularly within dynamic environments. While Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and related algorithms such as Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) perform well in single-agent, stationary environments, they suffer from high variance in MARL due to non-stationary and hidden policies of opponents, leading to diminished reward performance. Additionally, existing methods in MARL face significant challenges, including the need for inter-agent communication, reliance on explicit reward information, high computational demands, and sampling inefficiencies. These issues render them less effective in continuous environments where opponents may abruptly change their policies without prior notice. Against this background, we present OPS-DeMo (Online Policy Switch-Detection Model), an online algorithm that employs dynamic error decay to detect changes in opponents' policies. OPS-DeMo continuously updates its beliefs using an Assumed Opponent Policy (AOP) Bank and selects corresponding responses from a pre-trained Response Policy Bank. Each response policy is trained against consistently strategizing opponents, reducing training uncertainty and enabling the effective use of algorithms like PPO in multi-agent environments. Comparative assessments show that our approach outperforms PPO-trained models in dynamic scenarios like the Predator-Prey setting, providing greater robustness to sudden policy shifts and enabling more informed decision-making through precise opponent policy insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has attracted great attention due to its characteristic of high efficiency and accuracy. Currently, the ANN-to-SNN conversion methods can obtain ANN on-par accuracy SNN with ultra-low latency (8 time-steps) in CNN structure on computer vision (CV) tasks. However, as Transformer-based networks have achieved prevailing precision on both CV and natural language processing (NLP), the Transformer-based SNNs are still encounting the lower accuracy w.r.t the ANN counterparts. In this work, we introduce a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion method called SpikeZIP-TF, where ANN and SNN are exactly equivalent, thus incurring no accuracy degradation. SpikeZIP-TF achieves 83.82% accuracy on CV dataset (ImageNet) and 93.79% accuracy on NLP dataset (SST-2), which are higher than SOTA Transformer-based SNNs. The code is available in GitHub: https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Research-Group/SpikeZIP_transformer</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel approach to synthesizing subsurface velocity models using diffusion generative models. Conventional methods rely on extensive, high-quality datasets, which are often inaccessible in subsurface applications. Our method leverages incomplete well and seismic observations to produce high-fidelity velocity samples without requiring fully sampled training datasets. The results demonstrate that our generative model accurately captures long-range structures, aligns with ground-truth velocity models, achieves high Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) scores, and provides meaningful uncertainty estimations. This approach facilitates realistic subsurface velocity synthesis, offering valuable inputs for full-waveform inversion and enhancing seismic-based subsurface modeling.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of TPMS Architected Materials Using Simulated Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research paper presents a novel approach to optimizing the tensile stress of Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures through machine learning and Simulated Annealing (SA). The study evaluates the performance of Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost models in predicting tensile stress, using a dataset generated from finite element analysis of TPMS models. The objective function minimized the negative R-squared value on the validation set to enhance model accuracy. The SA-XGBoost model outperformed the others, achieving an R-squared value of 0.96. In contrast, the SA-Random Forest model achieved an R squared value of 0.89 while the SA-Decision Tree model exhibited greater fluctuations in validation scores. This demonstrates that the SA-XGBoost model is most effective in capturing the complex relationships within the data. The integration of SA helps in optimizing the hyperparameters of these machine learning models, thereby enhancing their predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>The Factorization Curse: Which Tokens You Predict Underlie the Reversal Curse and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's best language models still struggle with hallucinations: factually incorrect generations, which impede their ability to reliably retrieve information seen during training. The reversal curse, where models cannot recall information when probed in a different order than was encountered during training, exemplifies this in information retrieval. We reframe the reversal curse as a factorization curse - a failure of models to learn the same joint distribution under different factorizations. Through a series of controlled experiments with increasing levels of realism including WikiReversal, a setting we introduce to closely simulate a knowledge intensive finetuning task, we find that the factorization curse is an inherent failure of the next-token prediction objective used in popular large language models. Moreover, we demonstrate reliable information retrieval cannot be solved with scale, reversed tokens, or even naive bidirectional-attention training. Consequently, various approaches to finetuning on specialized data would necessarily provide mixed results on downstream tasks, unless the model has already seen the right sequence of tokens. Across five tasks of varying levels of complexity, our results uncover a promising path forward: factorization-agnostic objectives can significantly mitigate the reversal curse and hint at improved knowledge storage and planning capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) will have significant impact on content creation platforms. In this paper, we study the dynamic competition between a GenAI and a human contributor. Unlike the human, the GenAI's content only improves when more contents are created by human over the time; however, GenAI has the advantage of generating content at a lower cost. We study the algorithmic problem in this dynamic competition model about how the human contributor can maximize her utility when competing against the GenAI for content generation over a set of topics. In time-sensitive content domains (e.g., news or pop music creation) where contents' value diminishes over time, we show that there is no polynomial time algorithm for finding the human's optimal (dynamic) strategy, unless the randomized exponential time hypothesis is false. Fortunately, we are able to design a polynomial time algorithm that naturally cycles between myopically optimizing over a short time window and pausing and provably guarantees an approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{2}$. We then turn to time-insensitive content domains where contents do not lose their value (e.g., contents on history facts). Interestingly, we show that this setting permits a polynomial time algorithm that maximizes the human's utility in the long run.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper investigates the escalating concerns surrounding the surge in diabetes cases, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the subsequent strain on medical resources. The research aims to construct a predictive model quantifying factors influencing inpatient hospital stay durations for diabetes patients, offering insights to hospital administrators for improved patient management strategies. The literature review highlights the increasing prevalence of diabetes, emphasizing the need for continued attention and analysis of urban-rural disparities in healthcare access. International studies underscore the financial implications and healthcare burden associated with diabetes-related hospitalizations and complications, emphasizing the significance of effective management strategies. The methodology involves a quantitative approach, utilizing a dataset comprising 10,000 observations of diabetic inpatient encounters in U.S. hospitals from 1999 to 2008. Predictive modeling techniques, particularly Generalized Linear Models (GLM), are employed to develop a model predicting hospital stay durations based on patient demographics, admission types, medical history, and treatment regimen. The results highlight the influence of age, medical history, and treatment regimen on hospital stay durations for diabetes patients. Despite model limitations, such as heteroscedasticity and deviations from normality in residual analysis, the findings offer valuable insights for hospital administrators in patient management. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research to address model limitations and explore the implications of predictive models on healthcare management strategies, ensuring equitable patient care and resource allocation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation has the potential to improve the performance of machine learning models by increasing the amount of training data available. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of different data augmentation techniques for a multi-label emotion classification task using a low-resource dataset. Our results showed that Back Translation outperformed autoencoder-based approaches and that generating multiple examples per training instance led to further performance improvement. In addition, we found that Back Translation generated the most diverse set of unigrams and trigrams. These findings demonstrate the utility of Back Translation in enhancing the performance of emotion classification models in resource-limited situations.</description>

      <title>LLMs Are Not Intelligent Thinkers: Introducing Mathematical Topic Tree Benchmark for Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in mathematical reasoning. However, despite these achievements, current evaluations are mostly limited to specific mathematical topics, and it remains unclear whether LLMs are genuinely engaging in reasoning. To address these gaps, we present the Mathematical Topics Tree (MaTT) benchmark, a challenging and structured benchmark that offers 1,958 questions across a wide array of mathematical subjects, each paired with a detailed hierarchical chain of topics. Upon assessing different LLMs using the MaTT benchmark, we find that the most advanced model, GPT-4, achieved a mere 54\% accuracy in a multiple-choice scenario. Interestingly, even when employing Chain-of-Thought prompting, we observe mostly no notable improvement. Moreover, LLMs accuracy dramatically reduced by up to 24.2 percentage point when the questions were presented without providing choices. Further detailed analysis of the LLMs' performance across a range of topics showed significant discrepancy even for closely related subtopics within the same general mathematical area. In an effort to pinpoint the reasons behind LLMs performances, we conducted a manual evaluation of the completeness and correctness of the explanations generated by GPT-4 when choices were available. Surprisingly, we find that in only 53.3\% of the instances where the model provided a correct answer, the accompanying explanations were deemed complete and accurate, i.e., the model engaged in genuine reasoning.</description>

      <title>On Subjective Uncertainty Quantification and Calibration in Natural Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applications of large language models often involve the generation of free-form responses, in which case uncertainty quantification becomes challenging. This is due to the need to identify task-specific uncertainties (e.g., about the semantics) which appears difficult to define in general cases. This work addresses these challenges from a perspective of Bayesian decision theory, starting from the assumption that our utility is characterized by a similarity measure that compares a generated response with a hypothetical true response. We discuss how this assumption enables principled quantification of the model's subjective uncertainty and its calibration. We further derive a measure for epistemic uncertainty, based on a missing data perspective and its characterization as an excess risk. The proposed measures can be applied to black-box language models. We demonstrate the proposed methods on question answering and machine translation tasks, where they extract broadly meaningful uncertainty estimates from GPT and Gemini models and quantify their calibration.</description>

      <title>CorDA: Context-Oriented Decomposition Adaptation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods build adapters without considering the context of downstream task to learn, or the context of important knowledge to maintain. As a result, there is often a performance gap compared to full-parameter finetuning, and meanwhile the finetuned model suffers from catastrophic forgetting of the pre-trained world knowledge. In this paper, we propose CorDA, a Context-oriented Decomposition Adaptation method that builds learnable adapters from weight decomposition oriented by the context of downstream task or world knowledge. Concretely, we collect a few data samples, and perform singular value decomposition for each linear layer of a pre-trained LLM multiplied by the covariance matrix of the input activation using these samples. By doing so, the context of the representative samples is captured through deciding the factorizing orientation. Our method enables two options, the knowledge-preserved adaptation and the instruction-previewed adaptation. For the former, we use question-answering samples to obtain the covariance matrices, and use the decomposed components with the smallest $r$ singular values to initialize a learnable adapter, with the others frozen such that the world knowledge is better preserved. For the latter, we use the instruction data from the finetuning task, such as math or coding, to orientate the decomposition and train the largest $r$ components that capture the main characteristics of the task to learn. We conduct extensive experiments on Math, Code, and Instruction Following tasks. Our knowledge-preserved adaptation not only achieves better performance than LoRA on finetuning tasks, but also mitigates the forgetting of world knowledge. Our instruction-previewed adaptation is able to further enhance the finetuning performance, surpassing full-parameter finetuning and the state-of-the-art PEFT methods.</description>

      <title>A Language Model-Guided Framework for Mining Time Series with Distributional Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective utilization of time series data is often constrained by the scarcity of data quantity that reflects complex dynamics, especially under the condition of distributional shifts. Existing datasets may not encompass the full range of statistical properties required for robust and comprehensive analysis. And privacy concerns can further limit their accessibility in domains such as finance and healthcare. This paper presents an approach that utilizes large language models and data source interfaces to explore and collect time series datasets. While obtained from external sources, the collected data share critical statistical properties with primary time series datasets, making it possible to model and adapt to various scenarios. This method enlarges the data quantity when the original data is limited or lacks essential properties. It suggests that collected datasets can effectively supplement existing datasets, especially involving changes in data distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the collected datasets through practical examples and show how time series forecasting foundation models fine-tuned on these datasets achieve comparable performance to those models without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Generative Explore-Exploit: Training-free Optimization of Generative Recommender Systems using LLM Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are widely used to suggest engaging content, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have given rise to generative recommenders. Such systems can directly generate items, including for open-set tasks like question suggestion. While the world knowledge of LLMs enable good recommendations, improving the generated content through user feedback is challenging as continuously fine-tuning LLMs is prohibitively expensive. We present a training-free approach for optimizing generative recommenders by connecting user feedback loops to LLM-based optimizers. We propose a generative explore-exploit method that can not only exploit generated items with known high engagement, but also actively explore and discover hidden population preferences to improve recommendation quality. We evaluate our approach on question generation in two domains (e-commerce and general knowledge), and model user feedback with Click Through Rate (CTR). Experiments show our LLM-based explore-exploit approach can iteratively improve recommendations, and consistently increase CTR. Ablation analysis shows that generative exploration is key to learning user preferences, avoiding the pitfalls of greedy exploit-only approaches. A human evaluation strongly supports our quantitative findings.</description>

      <title>A model of early word acquisition based on realistic-scale audiovisual naming events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infants gradually learn to parse continuous speech into words and connect names with objects, yet the mechanisms behind development of early word perception skills remain unknown. We studied the extent to which early words can be acquired through statistical learning from regularities in audiovisual sensory input. We simulated word learning in infants up to 12 months of age in a realistic setting, using a model that solely learns from statistical regularities in unannotated raw speech and pixel-level visual input. Crucially, the quantity of object naming events was carefully designed to match that accessible to infants of comparable ages. Results show that the model effectively learns to recognize words and associate them with corresponding visual objects, with a vocabulary growth rate comparable to that observed in infants. The findings support the viability of general statistical learning for early word perception, demonstrating how learning can operate without assuming any prior linguistic capabilities.</description>

      <title>TLEX: An Efficient Method for Extracting Exact Timelines from TimeML Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A timeline provides a total ordering of events and times, and is useful for a number of natural language understanding tasks. However, qualitative temporal graphs that can be derived directly from text -- such as TimeML annotations -- usually explicitly reveal only partial orderings of events and times. In this work, we apply prior work on solving point algebra problems to the task of extracting timelines from TimeML annotated texts, and develop an exact, end-to-end solution which we call TLEX (TimeLine EXtraction). TLEX transforms TimeML annotations into a collection of timelines arranged in a trunk-and-branch structure. Like what has been done in prior work, TLEX checks the consistency of the temporal graph and solves it; however, it adds two novel functionalities. First, it identifies specific relations involved in an inconsistency (which could then be manually corrected) and, second, TLEX performs a novel identification of sections of the timelines that have indeterminate order, information critical for downstream tasks such as aligning events from different timelines. We provide detailed descriptions and analysis of the algorithmic components in TLEX, and conduct experimental evaluations by applying TLEX to 385 TimeML annotated texts from four corpora. We show that 123 of the texts are inconsistent, 181 of them have more than one ``real world'' or main timeline, and there are 2,541 indeterminate sections across all four corpora. A sampling evaluation showed that TLEX is 98--100% accurate with 95% confidence along five dimensions: the ordering of time-points, the number of main timelines, the placement of time-points on main versus subordinate timelines, the connecting point of branch timelines, and the location of the indeterminate sections. We provide a reference implementation of TLEX, the extracted timelines for all texts, and the manual corrections of the inconsistent texts.</description>

      <title>SuperPos-Prompt: Enhancing Soft Prompt Tuning of Language Models with Superposition of Multi Token Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft prompt tuning techniques have recently gained traction as an effective strategy for the parameter-efficient tuning of pretrained language models, particularly minimizing the required adjustment of model parameters. Despite their growing use, achieving optimal tuning with soft prompts, especially for smaller datasets, remains a substantial challenge. This study makes two contributions in this domain: (i) we introduce SuperPos-Prompt, a new reparameterization technique employing the superposition of multiple pretrained vocabulary embeddings to improve the learning of soft prompts. Our experiments across several GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks consistently highlight SuperPos-Prompt's superiority over Residual Prompt tuning, exhibiting an average score increase of $+6.4$ in T5-Small and $+5.0$ in T5-Base along with a faster convergence. Remarkably, SuperPos-Prompt occasionally outperforms even full fine-tuning methods. (ii) Additionally, we demonstrate enhanced performance and rapid convergence by omitting dropouts from the frozen network, yielding consistent improvements across various scenarios and tuning methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Eye Surgeon: Finding Image Priors through Sparse Generators at Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Optimal Eye Surgeon (OES), a framework for pruning and training deep image generator networks. Typically, untrained deep convolutional networks, which include image sampling operations, serve as effective image priors (Ulyanov et al., 2018). However, they tend to overfit to noise in image restoration tasks due to being overparameterized. OES addresses this by adaptively pruning networks at random initialization to a level of underparameterization. This process effectively captures low-frequency image components even without training, by just masking. When trained to fit noisy images, these pruned subnetworks, which we term Sparse-DIP, resist overfitting to noise. This benefit arises from underparameterization and the regularization effect of masking, constraining them in the manifold of image priors. We demonstrate that subnetworks pruned through OES surpass other leading pruning methods, such as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which is known to be suboptimal for image recovery tasks (Wu et al., 2023). Our extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of OES-masks and the characteristics of sparse-subnetworks for image generation.

      <title>DeviceBERT: Applied Transfer Learning With Targeted Annotations and Vocabulary Enrichment to Identify Medical Device and Component Terminology in FDA Recall Summaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FDA Medical Device recalls are critical and time-sensitive events, requiring swift identification of impacted devices to inform the public of a recall event and ensure patient safety. The OpenFDA device recall dataset contains valuable information about ongoing device recall actions, but manually extracting relevant device information from the recall action summaries is a time-consuming task. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and categorizing named entities in unstructured text. Existing NER models, including domain-specific models like BioBERT, struggle to correctly identify medical device trade names, part numbers and component terms within these summaries. To address this, we propose DeviceBERT, a medical device annotation, pre-processing and enrichment pipeline, which builds on BioBERT to identify and label medical device terminology in the device recall summaries with improved accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach can be applied effectively for performing entity recognition tasks where training data is limited or sparse.</description>

      <title>Relational Proxy Loss for Audio-Text based Keyword Spotting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on user convenience, leading to increased interest in text-based keyword enrollment systems for keyword spotting (KWS). Since the system utilizes text input during the enrollment phase and audio input during actual usage, we call this task audio-text based KWS. To enable this task, both acoustic and text encoders are typically trained using deep metric learning loss functions, such as triplet- and proxy-based losses. This study aims to improve existing methods by leveraging the structural relations within acoustic embeddings and within text embeddings. Unlike previous studies that only compare acoustic and text embeddings on a point-to-point basis, our approach focuses on the relational structures within the embedding space by introducing the concept of Relational Proxy Loss (RPL). By incorporating RPL, we demonstrated improved performance on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus.</description>

      <title>Concept Formation and Alignment in Language Models: Bridging Statistical Patterns in Latent Space to Concept Taxonomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept formation and alignment within the realm of language models (LMs). We propose a mechanism for identifying concepts and their hierarchical organization within the semantic representations learned by various LMs, encompassing a spectrum from early models like Glove to the transformer-based language models like ALBERT and T5. Our approach leverages the inherent structure present in the semantic embeddings generated by these models to extract a taxonomy of concepts and their hierarchical relationships. This investigation sheds light on how LMs develop conceptual understanding and opens doors to further research to improve their ability to reason and leverage real-world knowledge. We further conducted experiments and observed the possibility of isolating these extracted conceptual representations from the reasoning modules of the transformer-based LMs. The observed concept formation along with the isolation of conceptual representations from the reasoning modules can enable targeted token engineering to open the door for potential applications in knowledge transfer, explainable AI, and the development of more modular and conceptually grounded language models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for SMART-101 Challenge of CVPR Multi-modal Algorithmic Reasoning Task 2024. Unlike traditional visual questions and answer tasks, this challenge evaluates abstraction, deduction and generalization ability of neural network in solving visuo-linguistic puzzles designed for specially children in the 6-8 age group. Our model is based on two pre-trained models, dedicated to extract features from text and image respectively. To integrate the features from different modalities, we employed a fusion layer with attention mechanism. We explored different text and image pre-trained models, and fine-tune the integrated classifier on the SMART-101 dataset. Experiment results show that under the data splitting style of puzzle split, our proposed integrated classifier achieves superior performance, verifying the effectiveness of multi-modal pre-trained representations.</description>

      <title>Teaching-Assistant-in-the-Loop: Improving Knowledge Distillation from Imperfect Teacher Models in Low-Budget Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in distilling task-specific knowledge from large language models (LLM) to smaller student models. Nonetheless, LLM distillation presents a dual challenge: 1) there is a high cost associated with querying the teacher LLM, such as GPT-4, for gathering an ample number of demonstrations; 2) the teacher LLM might provide imperfect outputs with a negative impact on the student's learning process. To enhance sample efficiency within resource-constrained, imperfect teacher scenarios, we propose a three-component framework leveraging three signal types. The first signal is the student's self-consistency (consistency of student multiple outputs), which is a proxy of the student's confidence. Specifically, we introduce a ``teaching assistant'' (TA) model to assess the uncertainty of both the student's and the teacher's outputs via confidence scoring, which serves as another two signals for student training. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training schema to first warm up the student with a small proportion of data to better utilize student's signal. Experiments have shown the superiority of our proposed framework for four complex reasoning tasks. On average, our proposed two-stage framework brings a relative improvement of up to 20.79% compared to fine-tuning without any signals across datasets.</description>

      <title>To what extent can ASV systems naturally defend against spoofing attacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current automatic speaker verification (ASV) task involves making binary decisions on two types of trials: target and non-target. However, emerging advancements in speech generation technology pose significant threats to the reliability of ASV systems. This study investigates whether ASV effortlessly acquires robustness against spoofing attacks (i.e., zero-shot capability) by systematically exploring diverse ASV systems and spoofing attacks, ranging from traditional to cutting-edge techniques. Through extensive analyses conducted on eight distinct ASV systems and 29 spoofing attack systems, we demonstrate that the evolution of ASV inherently incorporates defense mechanisms against spoofing attacks. Nevertheless, our findings also underscore that the advancement of spoofing attacks far outpaces that of ASV systems, hence necessitating further research on spoofing-robust ASV methodologies.</description>

      <title>MSAGPT: Neural Prompting Protein Structure Prediction via MSA Generative Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) plays a pivotal role in unveiling the evolutionary trajectories of protein families. The accuracy of protein structure predictions is often compromised for protein sequences that lack sufficient homologous information to construct high quality MSA. Although various methods have been proposed to generate virtual MSA under these conditions, they fall short in comprehensively capturing the intricate coevolutionary patterns within MSA or require guidance from external oracle models. Here we introduce MSAGPT, a novel approach to prompt protein structure predictions via MSA generative pretraining in the low MSA regime. MSAGPT employs a simple yet effective 2D evolutionary positional encoding scheme to model complex evolutionary patterns. Endowed by this, its flexible 1D MSA decoding framework facilitates zero or few shot learning. Moreover, we demonstrate that leveraging the feedback from AlphaFold2 can further enhance the model capacity via Rejective Fine tuning (RFT) and Reinforcement Learning from AF2 Feedback (RLAF). Extensive experiments confirm the efficacy of MSAGPT in generating faithful virtual MSA to enhance the structure prediction accuracy. The transfer learning capabilities also highlight its great potential for facilitating other protein tasks.</description>

Abstract: We explore the ability of GPT-4 to perform ad-hoc schema based information extraction from scientific literature. We assess specifically whether it can, with a basic prompting approach, replicate two existing material science datasets, given the manuscripts from which they were originally manually extracted. We employ materials scientists to perform a detailed manual error analysis to assess where the model struggles to faithfully extract the desired information, and draw on their insights to suggest research directions to address this broadly important task.</description>

      <title>Investigating Memory Failure Prediction Across CPU Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale datacenters often experience memory failures, where Uncorrectable Errors (UEs) highlight critical malfunction in Dual Inline Memory Modules (DIMMs). Existing approaches primarily utilize Correctable Errors (CEs) to predict UEs, yet they typically neglect how these errors vary between different CPU architectures, especially in terms of Error Correction Code (ECC) applicability. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between CEs and UEs across different CPU architectures, including X86 and ARM. Our analysis identifies unique patterns of memory failure associated with each processor platform. Leveraging Machine Learning (ML) techniques on production datasets, we conduct the memory failure prediction in different processors' platforms, achieving up to 15% improvements in F1-score compared to the existing algorithm. Finally, an MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) framework is provided to consistently improve the failure prediction in the production environment.</description>

      <title>Is On-Device AI Broken and Exploitable? Assessing the Trust and Ethics in Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a very first study to investigate trust and ethical implications of on-device artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on ''small'' language models (SLMs) amenable for personal devices like smartphones. While on-device SLMs promise enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and improved user experience compared to cloud-based services, we posit that they might also introduce significant challenges and vulnerabilities compared to on-server counterparts.
  As part of our trust assessment study, we conduct a systematic evaluation of the state-of-the-art on-devices SLMs, contrasted to their on-server counterparts, based on a well-established trustworthiness measurement framework. Our results show on-device SLMs to be (statistically) significantly less trustworthy, specifically demonstrating more stereotypical, unfair and privacy-breaching behavior. Informed by these findings, we then perform our ethics assessment study by inferring whether SLMs would provide responses to potentially unethical vanilla prompts, collated from prior jailbreaking and prompt engineering studies and other sources. Strikingly, the on-device SLMs did answer valid responses to these prompts, which ideally should be rejected. Even more seriously, the on-device SLMs responded with valid answers without any filters and without the need for any jailbreaking or prompt engineering. These responses can be abused for various harmful and unethical scenarios including: societal harm, illegal activities, hate, self-harm, exploitable phishing content and exploitable code, all of which indicates the high vulnerability and exploitability of these on-device SLMs. Overall, our findings highlight gaping vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art on-device AI which seem to stem from resource constraints faced by these models and which may make typical defenses fundamentally challenging to be deployed in these environments.</description>

      <title>CaLM: Contrasting Large and Small Language Models to Verify Grounded Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grounded generation aims to equip language models (LMs) with the ability to produce more credible and accountable responses by accurately citing verifiable sources. However, existing methods, by either feeding LMs with raw or preprocessed materials, remain prone to errors. To address this, we introduce CaLM, a novel verification framework. CaLM leverages the insight that a robust grounded response should be consistent with information derived solely from its cited sources. Our framework empowers smaller LMs, which rely less on parametric memory and excel at processing relevant information given a query, to validate the output of larger LMs. Larger LM responses that closely align with the smaller LMs' output, which relies exclusively on cited documents, are verified. Responses showing discrepancies are iteratively refined through a feedback loop. Experiments on three open-domain question-answering datasets demonstrate significant performance gains of 1.5% to 7% absolute average without any required model fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Venn Diagram Prompting : Accelerating Comprehension with Scaffolding Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Venn Diagram (VD) Prompting, an innovative prompting technique which allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to combine and synthesize information across complex, diverse and long-context documents in knowledge-intensive question-answering tasks. Generating answers from multiple documents involves numerous steps to extract relevant and unique information and amalgamate it into a cohesive response. To improve the quality of the final answer, multiple LLM calls or pretrained models are used to perform different tasks such as summarization, reorganization and customization. The approach covered in the paper focuses on replacing the multi-step strategy via a single LLM call using VD prompting. Our proposed technique also aims to eliminate the inherent position bias in the LLMs, enhancing consistency in answers by removing sensitivity to the sequence of input information. It overcomes the challenge of inconsistency traditionally associated with varying input sequences. We also explore the practical applications of the VD prompt based on our examination of the prompt's outcomes. In the experiments performed on four public benchmark question-answering datasets, VD prompting continually matches or surpasses the performance of a meticulously crafted instruction prompt which adheres to optimal guidelines and practices.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unparalleled success across diverse language modeling tasks in recent years. However, this progress has also intensified ethical concerns, impacting the deployment of LLMs in everyday contexts. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of ethical challenges associated with LLMs, from longstanding issues such as copyright infringement, systematic bias, and data privacy, to emerging problems like truthfulness and social norms. We critically analyze existing research aimed at understanding, examining, and mitigating these ethical risks. Our survey underscores integrating ethical standards and societal values into the development of LLMs, thereby guiding the development of responsible and ethically aligned language models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of score-based generative models (SGMs) designed to handle high-cardinality data distributions by leveraging concepts from mean-field theory. We present mean-field chaos diffusion models (MF-CDMs), which address the curse of dimensionality inherent in high-cardinality data by utilizing the propagation of chaos property of interacting particles. By treating high-cardinality data as a large stochastic system of interacting particles, we develop a novel score-matching method for infinite-dimensional chaotic particle systems and propose an approximation scheme that employs a subdivision strategy for efficient training. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of MF-CDMs for managing large high-cardinality data structures, such as 3D point clouds.</description>

      <title>Natural Language-Oriented Programming (NLOP): Towards Democratizing Software Creation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies evolve, they offer unprecedented potential to automate and enhance various tasks, including coding. Natural Language-Oriented Programming (NLOP), a vision introduced in this paper, harnesses this potential by allowing developers to articulate software requirements and logic in their natural language, thereby democratizing software creation. This approach streamlines the development process and significantly lowers the barrier to entry for software engineering, making it feasible for non-experts to contribute effectively to software projects. By simplifying the transition from concept to code, NLOP can accelerate development cycles, enhance collaborative efforts, and reduce misunderstandings in requirement specifications. This paper reviews various programming models, assesses their contributions and limitations, and highlights that natural language will be the new programming language. Through this comparison, we illustrate how NLOP stands to transform the landscape of software engineering by fostering greater inclusivity and innovation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for multimedia applications. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test distributions within batches. This work provides a new perspective on analyzing batch normalization techniques through class-related and class-irrelevant features, our observations reveal combining source and test batch normalization statistics robustly characterizes target distributions. However, test statistics must have high similarity. We thus propose Discover Your Neighbours (DYN), the first backward-free approach specialized for dynamic TTA. The core innovation is identifying similar samples via instance normalization statistics and clustering into groups which provides consistent class-irrelevant representations. Specifically, Our DYN consists of layer-wise instance statistics clustering (LISC) and cluster-aware batch normalization (CABN). In LISC, we perform layer-wise clustering of approximate feature samples at each BN layer by calculating the cosine similarity of instance normalization statistics across the batch. CABN then aggregates SBN and TCN statistics to collaboratively characterize the target distribution, enabling more robust representations. Experimental results validate DYN's robustness and effectiveness, demonstrating maintained performance under dynamic data stream patterns.</description>

      <title>Novel Approach to Intrusion Detection: Introducing GAN-MSCNN-BILSTM with LIME Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative intrusion detection system that harnesses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks (MSCNNs), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, supplemented by Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for interpretability. Employing a GAN, the system generates realistic network traffic data, encompassing both normal and attack patterns. This synthesized data is then fed into an MSCNN-BiLSTM architecture for intrusion detection. The MSCNN layer extracts features from the network traffic data at different scales, while the BiLSTM layer captures temporal dependencies within the traffic sequences. Integration of LIME allows for explaining the model's decisions. Evaluation on the Hogzilla dataset, a standard benchmark, showcases an impressive accuracy of 99.16\% for multi-class classification and 99.10\% for binary classification, while ensuring interpretability through LIME. This fusion of deep learning and interpretability presents a promising avenue for enhancing intrusion detection systems by improving transparency and decision support in network security.</description>

      <title>Design of reliable technology valuation model with calibrated machine learning of patent indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized the digital transformation of technology valuation by predicting the value of patents with high accuracy. However, the lack of validation regarding the reliability of these models hinders experts from fully trusting the confidence of model predictions. To address this issue, we propose an analytical framework for reliable technology valuation using calibrated ML models, which provide robust confidence levels in model predictions. We extract quantitative patent indicators that represent various technology characteristics as input data, using the patent maintenance period as a proxy for technology values. Multiple ML models are developed to capture the nonlinear relationship between patent indicators and technology value. The reliability and accuracy of these models are evaluated, presenting a Pareto-front map where the expected calibration error, Matthews correlation coefficient and F1-scores are compared. After identifying the best-performing model, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis to pinpoint the most significant input features by confidence bin. Through a case study, we confirmed that the proposed approach offers a practical guideline for developing reliable and accurate ML-based technology valuation models, with significant implications for both academia and industry.</description>

      <title>Fighting Against the Repetitive Training and Sample Dependency Problem in Few-shot Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot named entity recognition (NER) systems recognize entities using a few labeled training examples. The general pipeline consists of a span detector to identify entity spans in text and an entity-type classifier to assign types to entities. Current span detectors rely on extensive manual labeling to guide training. Almost every span detector requires initial training on basic span features followed by adaptation to task-specific features. This process leads to repetitive training of the basic span features among span detectors. Additionally, metric-based entity-type classifiers, such as prototypical networks, typically employ a specific metric that gauges the distance between the query sample and entity-type referents, ultimately assigning the most probable entity type to the query sample. However, these classifiers encounter the sample dependency problem, primarily stemming from the limited samples available for each entity-type referent. To address these challenges, we proposed an improved few-shot NER pipeline. First, we introduce a steppingstone span detector that is pre-trained on open-domain Wikipedia data. It can be used to initialize the pipeline span detector to reduce the repetitive training of basic features. Second, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to set reliable entity-type referents, eliminating reliance on few-shot samples of each type. Our model exhibits superior performance with fewer training steps and human-labeled data compared with baselines, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on various datasets. Particularly in fine-grained few-shot NER settings, our model outperforms strong baselines, including ChatGPT. We will publicly release the code, datasets, LLM outputs, and model checkpoints.</description>

      <title>DAISY: Data Adaptive Self-Supervised Early Exit for Speech Representation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have shown to be useful for various tasks, but their large size limits the use in devices with low computing power and memory. In this work, we explore early exit, an approach for reducing latency by exiting the forward process of a network early. Most approaches of early exit need a separate early exit model for each task, with some even requiring fine-tuning of the entire pretrained model. We introduce Data Adaptive Self-Supervised Early Exit (DAISY), an approach that decides when to exit based on the self-supervised loss, eliminating the need for multiple round of training and fine-tuning. DAISY matches the performance of HuBERT on the MiniSUPERB benchmark, but with much faster inference times. Our analysis on the adaptivity of DAISY shows that the model exits early (using fewer layers) on clean data while exits late (using more layers) on noisy data, dynamically adjusting the computational cost of inference based on the noise level of each sample.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Non-Autoregressive Transformers for Efficient Image Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of image synthesis is currently flourishing due to the advancements in diffusion models. While diffusion models have been successful, their computational intensity has prompted the pursuit of more efficient alternatives. As a representative work, non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) have been recognized for their rapid generation. However, a major drawback of these models is their inferior performance compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we aim to re-evaluate the full potential of NATs by revisiting the design of their training and inference strategies. Specifically, we identify the complexities in properly configuring these strategies and indicate the possible sub-optimality in existing heuristic-driven designs. Recognizing this, we propose to go beyond existing methods by directly solving the optimal strategies in an automatic framework. The resulting method, named AutoNAT, advances the performance boundaries of NATs notably, and is able to perform comparably with the latest diffusion models at a significantly reduced inference cost. The effectiveness of AutoNAT is validated on four benchmark datasets, i.e., ImageNet-256 &amp; 512, MS-COCO, and CC3M.

      <title>Online Policy Distillation with Decision-Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy Distillation (PD) has become an effective method to improve deep reinforcement learning tasks. The core idea of PD is to distill policy knowledge from a teacher agent to a student agent. However, the teacher-student framework requires a well-trained teacher model which is computationally expensive.In the light of online knowledge distillation, we study the knowledge transfer between different policies that can learn diverse knowledge from the same environment.In this work, we propose Online Policy Distillation (OPD) with Decision-Attention (DA), an online learning framework in which different policies operate in the same environment to learn different perspectives of the environment and transfer knowledge to each other to obtain better performance together. With the absence of a well-performance teacher policy, the group-derived targets play a key role in transferring group knowledge to each student policy. However, naive aggregation functions tend to cause student policies quickly homogenize. To address the challenge, we introduce the Decision-Attention module to the online policies distillation framework. The Decision-Attention module can generate a distinct set of weights for each policy to measure the importance of group members. We use the Atari platform for experiments with various reinforcement learning algorithms, including PPO and DQN. In different tasks, our method can perform better than an independent training policy on both PPO and DQN algorithms. This suggests that our OPD-DA can transfer knowledge between different policies well and help agents obtain more rewards.</description>

      <title>SelfDefend: LLMs Can Defend Themselves against Jailbreaking in a Practical Manner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jailbreaking is an emerging adversarial attack that bypasses the safety alignment deployed in off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) and has evolved into four major categories: optimization-based attacks such as Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), jailbreak template-based attacks such as "Do-Anything-Now", advanced indirect attacks like DrAttack, and multilingual jailbreaks. However, delivering a practical jailbreak defense is challenging because it needs to not only handle all the above jailbreak attacks but also incur negligible delay to user prompts, as well as be compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs.
  Inspired by how the traditional security concept of shadow stacks defends against memory overflow attacks, this paper introduces a generic LLM jailbreak defense framework called SelfDefend, which establishes a shadow LLM defense instance to concurrently protect the target LLM instance in the normal stack and collaborate with it for checkpoint-based access control. The effectiveness of SelfDefend builds upon our observation that existing LLMs (both target and defense LLMs) have the capability to identify harmful prompts or intentions in user queries, which we empirically validate using the commonly used GPT-3.5/4 models across all major jailbreak attacks. Our measurements show that SelfDefend enables GPT-3.5 to suppress the attack success rate (ASR) by 8.97-95.74% (average: 60%) and GPT-4 by even 36.36-100% (average: 83%), while incurring negligible effects on normal queries. To further improve the defense's robustness and minimize costs, we employ a data distillation approach to tune dedicated open-source defense models. These models outperform four SOTA defenses and match the performance of GPT-4-based SelfDefend, with significantly lower extra delays. We also empirically show that the tuned models are robust to targeted GCG and prompt injection attacks.</description>

      <title>I-SIRch: AI-Powered Concept Annotation Tool For Equitable Extraction And Analysis Of Safety Insights From Maternity Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maternity care is a complex system involving treatments and interactions between patients, providers, and the care environment. To improve patient safety and outcomes, understanding the human factors (e.g. individuals decisions, local facilities) influencing healthcare delivery is crucial. However, most current tools for analysing healthcare data focus only on biomedical concepts (e.g. health conditions, procedures and tests), overlooking the importance of human factors. We developed a new approach called I-SIRch, using artificial intelligence to automatically identify and label human factors concepts in maternity healthcare investigation reports describing adverse maternity incidents produced by England's Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB). These incident investigation reports aim to identify opportunities for learning and improving maternal safety across the entire healthcare system. I-SIRch was trained using real data and tested on both real and simulated data to evaluate its performance in identifying human factors concepts. When applied to real reports, the model achieved a high level of accuracy, correctly identifying relevant concepts in 90\% of the sentences from 97 reports. Applying I-SIRch to analyse these reports revealed that certain human factors disproportionately affected mothers from different ethnic groups. Our work demonstrates the potential of using automated tools to identify human factors concepts in maternity incident investigation reports, rather than focusing solely on biomedical concepts. This approach opens up new possibilities for understanding the complex interplay between social, technical, and organisational factors influencing maternal safety and population health outcomes. By taking a more comprehensive view of maternal healthcare delivery, we can develop targeted interventions to address disparities and improve maternal outcomes.</description>

      <title>Verbalized Probabilistic Graphical Modeling with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faced with complex problems, the human brain demonstrates a remarkable capacity to transcend sensory input and form latent understandings of perceived world patterns. However, this cognitive capacity is not explicitly considered or encoded in current large language models (LLMs). As a result, LLMs often struggle to capture latent structures and model uncertainty in complex compositional reasoning tasks. This work introduces a novel Bayesian prompting approach that facilitates training-free Bayesian inference with LLMs by using a verbalized Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM). While traditional Bayesian approaches typically depend on extensive data and predetermined mathematical structures for learning latent factors and dependencies, our approach efficiently reasons latent variables and their probabilistic dependencies by prompting LLMs to adhere to Bayesian principles. We evaluated our model on several compositional reasoning tasks, both close-ended and open-ended. Our results indicate that the model effectively enhances confidence elicitation and text generation quality, demonstrating its potential to improve AI language understanding systems, especially in modeling uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Transferability via Information Bottleneck Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the perspective of information bottleneck (IB) theory, we propose a novel framework for performing black-box transferable adversarial attacks named IBTA, which leverages advancements in invariant features. Intuitively, diminishing the reliance of adversarial perturbations on the original data, under equivalent attack performance constraints, encourages a greater reliance on invariant features that contributes most to classification, thereby enhancing the transferability of adversarial attacks. Building on this motivation, we redefine the optimization of transferable attacks using a novel theoretical framework that centers around IB. Specifically, to overcome the challenge of unoptimizable mutual information, we propose a simple and efficient mutual information lower bound (MILB) for approximating computation. Moreover, to quantitatively evaluate mutual information, we utilize the Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) to perform a thorough analysis. Our experiments on the ImageNet dataset well demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of IBTA and derived MILB.

      <title>Exploring Adversarial Robustness of Deep State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) have proven effective in numerous task scenarios but face significant security challenges due to Adversarial Perturbations (APs) in real-world deployments. Adversarial Training (AT) is a mainstream approach to enhancing Adversarial Robustness (AR) and has been validated on various traditional DNN architectures. However, its effectiveness in improving the AR of SSMs remains unclear. While many enhancements in SSM components, such as integrating Attention mechanisms and expanding to data-dependent SSM parameterizations, have brought significant gains in Standard Training (ST) settings, their potential benefits in AT remain unexplored. To investigate this, we evaluate existing structural variants of SSMs with AT to assess their AR performance. We observe that pure SSM structures struggle to benefit from AT, whereas incorporating Attention yields a markedly better trade-off between robustness and generalization for SSMs in AT compared to other components. Nonetheless, the integration of Attention also leads to Robust Overfitting (RO) issues. To understand these phenomena, we empirically and theoretically analyze the output error of SSMs under AP. We find that fixed-parameterized SSMs have output error bounds strictly related to their parameters, limiting their AT benefits, while input-dependent SSMs may face the problem of error explosion. Furthermore, we show that the Attention component effectively scales the output error of SSMs during training, enabling them to benefit more from AT, but at the cost of introducing RO due to its high model complexity. Inspired by this, we propose a simple and effective Adaptive Scaling (AdS) mechanism that brings AT performance close to Attention-integrated SSMs without introducing the issue of RO.</description>

      <title>PAPR in Motion: Seamless Point-level 3D Scene Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the problem of point-level 3D scene interpolation, which aims to simultaneously reconstruct a 3D scene in two states from multiple views, synthesize smooth point-level interpolations between them, and render the scene from novel viewpoints, all without any supervision between the states. The primary challenge is on achieving a smooth transition between states that may involve significant and non-rigid changes. To address these challenges, we introduce "PAPR in Motion", a novel approach that builds upon the recent Proximity Attention Point Rendering (PAPR) technique, which can deform a point cloud to match a significantly different shape and render a visually coherent scene even after non-rigid deformations. Our approach is specifically designed to maintain the temporal consistency of the geometric structure by introducing various regularization techniques for PAPR. The result is a method that can effectively bridge large scene changes and produce visually coherent and temporally smooth interpolations in both geometry and appearance. Evaluation across diverse motion types demonstrates that "PAPR in Motion" outperforms the leading neural renderer for dynamic scenes.

      <title>Perturbation Towards Easy Samples Improves Targeted Adversarial Transferability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transferability of adversarial perturbations provides an effective shortcut for black-box attacks. Targeted perturbations have greater practicality but are more difficult to transfer between models. In this paper, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that neural networks trained on the same dataset have more consistent performance in High-Sample-Density-Regions (HSDR) of each class instead of low sample density regions. Therefore, in the target setting, adding perturbations towards HSDR of the target class is more effective in improving transferability. However, density estimation is challenging in high-dimensional scenarios. Further theoretical and experimental verification demonstrates that easy samples with low loss are more likely to be located in HSDR. Perturbations towards such easy samples in the target class can avoid density estimation for HSDR location. Based on the above facts, we verified that adding perturbations to easy samples in the target class improves targeted adversarial transferability of existing attack methods. A generative targeted attack strategy named Easy Sample Matching Attack (ESMA) is proposed, which has a higher success rate for targeted attacks and outperforms the SOTA generative method. Moreover, ESMA requires only 5% of the storage space and much less computation time comparing to the current SOTA, as ESMA attacks all classes with only one model instead of seperate models for each class. Our code is available at https://github.com/gjq100/ESMA.</description>

      <title>A Fine-tuning Dataset and Benchmark for Large Language Models for Protein Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parallels between protein sequences and natural language in their sequential structures have inspired the application of large language models (LLMs) to protein understanding. Despite the success of LLMs in NLP, their effectiveness in comprehending protein sequences remains an open question, largely due to the absence of datasets linking protein sequences to descriptive text. Researchers have then attempted to adapt LLMs for protein understanding by integrating a protein sequence encoder with a pre-trained LLM. However, this adaptation raises a fundamental question: "Can LLMs, originally designed for NLP, effectively comprehend protein sequences as a form of language?" Current datasets fall short in addressing this question due to the lack of a direct correlation between protein sequences and corresponding text descriptions, limiting the ability to train and evaluate LLMs for protein understanding effectively. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProteinLMDataset, a dataset specifically designed for further self-supervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs to enhance their capability for protein sequence comprehension. Specifically, ProteinLMDataset includes 17.46 billion tokens for pretraining and 893,000 instructions for SFT. Additionally, we present ProteinLMBench, the first benchmark dataset consisting of 944 manually verified multiple-choice questions for assessing the protein understanding capabilities of LLMs. ProteinLMBench incorporates protein-related details and sequences in multiple languages, establishing a new standard for evaluating LLMs' abilities in protein comprehension. The large language model InternLM2-7B, pretrained and fine-tuned on the ProteinLMDataset, outperforms GPT-4 on ProteinLMBench, achieving the highest accuracy score. The dataset and the benchmark are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsynbio/ProteinLMBench.</description>

      <title>VP-LLM: Text-Driven 3D Volume Completion with Large Language Models through Patchification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent conditional 3D completion works have mainly relied on CLIP or BERT to encode textual information, which cannot support complex instruction. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. Inspired by the recent advancements of LLM, we present Volume Patch LLM (VP-LLM), which leverages LLMs to perform conditional 3D completion in a single-forward pass. To integrate a 3D model into the LLM tokenization configuration, the incomplete 3D object is first divided into small patches that can be encoded independently. These encoded patches are then fed into an LLM along with the text prompt, instructing the LLM to capture the relations between these patches as well as injecting semantic meanings into the 3D object. Our results demonstrate a strong ability of LLMs to interpret complex text instructions and understand 3D objects, surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion-based 3D completion models in generation quality.</description>

      <title>Training Through Failure: Effects of Data Consistency in Parallel Machine Learning Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the impact of relaxing data consistency in parallel machine learning training during a failure using various parameter server configurations. Our failure recovery strategies include traditional checkpointing, chain replication (which ensures a backup server takes over in case of failure), and a novel stateless parameter server approach. In the stateless approach, workers continue generating gradient updates even if the parameter server is down, applying these updates once the server is back online. We compare these techniques to a standard checkpointing approach, where the training job is resumed from the latest checkpoint.
  To assess the resilience and performance of each configuration, we intentionally killed the parameter server during training for each experiment. Our experiment results indicate that the stateless parameter server approach continues to train towards convergence and improves accuracy as much as 10\% in the face of a failure despite using stale weights and gradients. The chain replication and checkpointing techniques demonstrate convergence but suffer from setbacks in accuracy due to restarting from old checkpoints. These results suggest that allowing workers to continue generating updates during server downtime and applying these updates later can effectively improve hardware utilization. Furthermore, despite higher resource usage, the stateless parameter server method incurs similar monetary costs in terms of hardware usage compared to standard checkpointing methods due to the pricing structure of common cloud providers.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer for Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio language models have recently emerged as a promising approach for various audio generation tasks, relying on audio tokenizers to encode waveforms into sequences of discrete symbols. Audio tokenization often poses a necessary compromise between code bitrate and reconstruction accuracy. When dealing with low-bitrate audio codes, language models are constrained to process only a subset of the information embedded in the audio, which in turn restricts their generative capabilities. To circumvent these issues, we propose encoding audio as vector sequences in continuous space $\mathbb R^d$ and autoregressively generating these sequences using a decoder-only diffusion transformer (ARDiT). Our findings indicate that ARDiT excels in zero-shot text-to-speech and exhibits performance that compares to or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art models. High-bitrate continuous speech representation enables almost flawless reconstruction, allowing our model to achieve nearly perfect speech editing. Our experiments reveal that employing Integral Kullback-Leibler (IKL) divergence for distillation at each autoregressive step significantly boosts the perceived quality of the samples. Simultaneously, it condenses the iterative sampling process of the diffusion model into a single step. Furthermore, ARDiT can be trained to predict several continuous vectors in one step, significantly reducing latency during sampling. Impressively, one of our models can generate $170$ ms of $24$ kHz speech per evaluation step with minimal degradation in performance. Audio samples are available at http://ardit-tts.github.io/ .</description>

Abstract: Detecting subjectivity in news sentences is crucial for identifying media bias, enhancing credibility, and combating misinformation by flagging opinion-based content. It provides insights into public sentiment, empowers readers to make informed decisions, and encourages critical thinking. While research has developed methods and systems for this purpose, most efforts have focused on English and other high-resourced languages. In this study, we present the first large dataset for subjectivity detection in Arabic, consisting of ~3.6K manually annotated sentences, and GPT-4o based explanation. In addition, we included instructions (both in English and Arabic) to facilitate LLM based fine-tuning. We provide an in-depth analysis of the dataset, annotation process, and extensive benchmark results, including PLMs and LLMs. Our analysis of the annotation process highlights that annotators were strongly influenced by their political, cultural, and religious backgrounds, especially at the beginning of the annotation process. The experimental results suggest that LLMs with in-context learning provide better performance. We aim to release the dataset and resources for the community.</description>

      <title>Automata Extraction from Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern machine (ML) learning systems, Transformer-based architectures have achieved milestone success across a broad spectrum of tasks, yet understanding their operational mechanisms remains an open problem. To improve the transparency of ML systems, automata extraction methods, which interpret stateful ML models as automata typically through formal languages, have proven effective for explaining the mechanism of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, few works have been applied to this paradigm to Transformer models. In particular, understanding their processing of formal languages and identifying their limitations in this area remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose an automata extraction algorithm specifically designed for Transformer models. Treating the Transformer model as a black-box system, we track the model through the transformation process of their internal latent representations during their operations, and then use classical pedagogical approaches like L* algorithm to interpret them as deterministic finite-state automata (DFA). Overall, our study reveals how the Transformer model comprehends the structure of formal languages, which not only enhances the interpretability of the Transformer-based ML systems but also marks a crucial step toward a deeper understanding of how ML systems process formal languages.

      <title>Trust the PRoC3S: Solving Long-Horizon Robotics Problems with LLMs and Constraint Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in pretrained large language models (LLMs) applied to robotics have demonstrated their capacity for sequencing a set of discrete skills to achieve open-ended goals in simple robotic tasks. In this paper, we examine the topic of LLM planning for a set of continuously parameterized skills whose execution must avoid violations of a set of kinematic, geometric, and physical constraints. We prompt the LLM to output code for a function with open parameters, which, together with environmental constraints, can be viewed as a Continuous Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CCSP). This CCSP can be solved through sampling or optimization to find a skill sequence and continuous parameter settings that achieve the goal while avoiding constraint violations. Additionally, we consider cases where the LLM proposes unsatisfiable CCSPs, such as those that are kinematically infeasible, dynamically unstable, or lead to collisions, and re-prompt the LLM to form a new CCSP accordingly. Experiments across three different simulated 3D domains demonstrate that our proposed strategy, PRoC3S, is capable of solving a wide range of complex manipulation tasks with realistic constraints on continuous parameters much more efficiently and effectively than existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Creativity Has Left the Chat: The Price of Debiasing Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing but can exhibit biases and may generate toxic content. While alignment techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reduce these issues, their impact on creativity, defined as syntactic and semantic diversity, remains unexplored. We investigate the unintended consequences of RLHF on the creativity of LLMs through three experiments focusing on the Llama-2 series. Our findings reveal that aligned models exhibit lower entropy in token predictions, form distinct clusters in the embedding space, and gravitate towards "attractor states", indicating limited output diversity. Our findings have significant implications for marketers who rely on LLMs for creative tasks such as copywriting, ad creation, and customer persona generation. The trade-off between consistency and creativity in aligned models should be carefully considered when selecting the appropriate model for a given application. We also discuss the importance of prompt engineering in harnessing the creative potential of base models.</description>

      <title>CERET: Cost-Effective Extrinsic Refinement for Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful models for generation tasks, but they may not generate good quality outputs in their first attempt. Apart from model fine-tuning, existing approaches to improve prediction accuracy and quality typically involve LLM self-improvement / self-reflection that incorporate feedback from models themselves. Despite their effectiveness, these methods are hindered by their high computational cost and lack of scalability. In this work, we propose CERET, a method for refining text generations by considering semantic stability, entailment and inter-sample uncertainty measures. Experimental results show that CERET outperforms Self-consistency and Self-rerank baselines consistently under various task setups, by ~1.6% in Rouge-1 for abstractive summarization and ~3.5% in hit rate for question answering. Compared to LLM Self-rerank method, our approach only requires 9.4% of its latency and is more cost-effective.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being deployed across various domains today. However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls. Our benchmark dataset and automated framework allow us to evaluate the performance of five LLMs, encompassing both black-box and open-source models. This work lays the foundation for future research into improving the efficiency of LLMs in interactive cybersecurity tasks and automated task planning. By providing a specialized dataset, our project offers an ideal platform for developing, testing, and refining LLM-based approaches to vulnerability detection and resolution. Evaluating LLMs on these challenges and comparing with human performance yields insights into their potential for AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to perform real-world threat management. We make our dataset open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/LLM_CTF_Database along with our playground automated framework https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/llm_ctf_automation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate an automatic hint generator for CS1 programming assignments powered by GPT-4, a large language model. This system provides natural language guidance about how students can improve their incorrect solutions to short programming exercises. A hint can be requested each time a student fails a test case. Our evaluation addresses three Research Questions:
  RQ1: Do the hints help students improve their code? RQ2: How effectively do the hints capture problems in student code? RQ3: Are the issues that students resolve the same as the issues addressed in the hints?
  To address these research questions quantitatively, we identified a set of fine-grained knowledge components and determined which ones apply to each exercise, incorrect solution, and generated hint. Comparing data from two large CS1 offerings, we found that access to the hints helps students to address problems with their code more quickly, that hints are able to consistently capture the most pressing errors in students' code, and that hints that address a few issues at once rather than a single bug are more likely to lead to direct student progress.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning to Predict Glaucoma Progression using Structural Changes in the Eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease characterized by optic neuropathy, leading to irreversible vision loss. It progresses gradually, often remaining undiagnosed until advanced stages. Early detection is crucial to monitor atrophy and develop treatment strategies to prevent further vision impairment. Data-centric methods have enabled computer-aided algorithms for precise glaucoma diagnosis.
  In this study, we use deep learning models to identify complex disease traits and progression criteria, detecting subtle changes indicative of glaucoma. We explore the structure-function relationship in glaucoma progression and predict functional impairment from structural eye deterioration. We analyze statistical and machine learning methods, including deep learning techniques with optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans for accurate progression prediction.
  Addressing challenges like age variability, data imbalances, and noisy labels, we develop novel semi-supervised time-series algorithms:
  1. Weakly-Supervised Time-Series Learning: We create a CNN-LSTM model to encode spatiotemporal features from OCT scans. This approach uses age-related progression and positive-unlabeled data to establish robust pseudo-progression criteria, bypassing gold-standard labels.
  2. Semi-Supervised Time-Series Learning: Using labels from Guided Progression Analysis (GPA) in a contrastive learning scheme, the CNN-LSTM architecture learns from potentially mislabeled data to improve prediction accuracy.
  Our methods outperform conventional and state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Which Backbone to Use: A Resource-efficient Domain Specific Comparison for Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contemporary computer vision applications, particularly image classification, architectural backbones pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet are commonly employed as feature extractors. Despite the widespread use of these pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there remains a gap in understanding the performance of various resource-efficient backbones across diverse domains and dataset sizes. Our study systematically evaluates multiple lightweight, pre-trained CNN backbones under consistent training settings across a variety of datasets, including natural images, medical images, galaxy images, and remote sensing images. This comprehensive analysis aims to aid machine learning practitioners in selecting the most suitable backbone for their specific problem, especially in scenarios involving small datasets where fine-tuning a pre-trained network is crucial. Even though attention-based architectures are gaining popularity, we observed that they tend to perform poorly under low data finetuning tasks compared to CNNs. We also observed that some CNN architectures such as ConvNeXt, RegNet and EfficientNet performs well compared to others on a diverse set of domains consistently. Our findings provide actionable insights into the performance trade-offs and effectiveness of different backbones, facilitating informed decision-making in model selection for a broad spectrum of computer vision domains.

Abstract: RoboCup Soccer Simulation 2D (SS2D) research is hampered by the complexity of existing Cpp-based codes like Helios, Cyrus, and Gliders, which also suffer from limited integration with modern machine learning frameworks. This development paper introduces a transformative solution a gRPC-based, language-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates with the high-performance Helios base code. This approach not only facilitates the use of diverse programming languages including CSharp, JavaScript, and Python but also maintains the computational efficiency critical for real time decision making in SS2D. By breaking down language barriers, our framework significantly enhances collaborative potential and flexibility, empowering researchers to innovate without the overhead of mastering or developing extensive base codes. We invite the global research community to leverage and contribute to the Cross Language Soccer (CLS) framework, which is openly available under the MIT License, to drive forward the capabilities of multi-agent systems in soccer simulations.</description>

      <title>CCSI: Continual Class-Specific Impression for Data-free Class Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world clinical settings, traditional deep learning-based classification methods struggle with diagnosing newly introduced disease types because they require samples from all disease classes for offline training. Class incremental learning offers a promising solution by adapting a deep network trained on specific disease classes to handle new diseases. However, catastrophic forgetting occurs, decreasing the performance of earlier classes when adapting the model to new data. Prior proposed methodologies to overcome this require perpetual storage of previous samples, posing potential practical concerns regarding privacy and storage regulations in healthcare. To this end, we propose a novel data-free class incremental learning framework that utilizes data synthesis on learned classes instead of data storage from previous classes. Our key contributions include acquiring synthetic data known as Continual Class-Specific Impression (CCSI) for previously inaccessible trained classes and presenting a methodology to effectively utilize this data for updating networks when introducing new classes. We obtain CCSI by employing data inversion over gradients of the trained classification model on previous classes starting from the mean image of each class inspired by common landmarks shared among medical images and utilizing continual normalization layers statistics as a regularizer in this pixel-wise optimization process. Subsequently, we update the network by combining the synthesized data with new class data and incorporate several losses, including an intra-domain contrastive loss to generalize the deep network trained on the synthesized data to real data, a margin loss to increase separation among previous classes and new ones, and a cosine-normalized cross-entropy loss to alleviate the adverse effects of imbalanced distributions in training data.</description>

      <title>How Alignment and Jailbreak Work: Explain LLM Safety through Intermediate Hidden States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on safety alignment to avoid responding to malicious user inputs. Unfortunately, jailbreak can circumvent safety guardrails, resulting in LLMs generating harmful content and raising concerns about LLM safety. Due to language models with intensive parameters often regarded as black boxes, the mechanisms of alignment and jailbreak are challenging to elucidate. In this paper, we employ weak classifiers to explain LLM safety through the intermediate hidden states. We first confirm that LLMs learn ethical concepts during pre-training rather than alignment and can identify malicious and normal inputs in the early layers. Alignment actually associates the early concepts with emotion guesses in the middle layers and then refines them to the specific reject tokens for safe generations. Jailbreak disturbs the transformation of early unethical classification into negative emotions. We conduct experiments on models from 7B to 70B across various model families to prove our conclusion. Overall, our paper indicates the intrinsical mechanism of LLM safety and how jailbreaks circumvent safety guardrails, offering a new perspective on LLM safety and reducing concerns.</description>

      <title>GTR: Improving Large 3D Reconstruction Models through Geometry and Texture Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for 3D mesh reconstruction from multi-view images. Our method takes inspiration from large reconstruction models like LRM that use a transformer-based triplane generator and a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model trained on multi-view images. However, in our method, we introduce several important modifications that allow us to significantly enhance 3D reconstruction quality. First of all, we examine the original LRM architecture and find several shortcomings. Subsequently, we introduce respective modifications to the LRM architecture, which lead to improved multi-view image representation and more computationally efficient training. Second, in order to improve geometry reconstruction and enable supervision at full image resolution, we extract meshes from the NeRF field in a differentiable manner and fine-tune the NeRF model through mesh rendering. These modifications allow us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both 2D and 3D evaluation metrics, such as a PSNR of 28.67 on Google Scanned Objects (GSO) dataset. Despite these superior results, our feed-forward model still struggles to reconstruct complex textures, such as text and portraits on assets. To address this, we introduce a lightweight per-instance texture refinement procedure. This procedure fine-tunes the triplane representation and the NeRF color estimation model on the mesh surface using the input multi-view images in just 4 seconds. This refinement improves the PSNR to 29.79 and achieves faithful reconstruction of complex textures, such as text. Additionally, our approach enables various downstream applications, including text- or image-to-3D generation.</description>

      <title>Visual Prompt Tuning in Null Space for Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing prompt-tuning methods have demonstrated impressive performances in continual learning (CL), by selecting and updating relevant prompts in the vision-transformer models. On the contrary, this paper aims to learn each task by tuning the prompts in the direction orthogonal to the subspace spanned by previous tasks' features, so as to ensure no interference on tasks that have been learned to overcome catastrophic forgetting in CL. However, different from the orthogonal projection in the traditional CNN architecture, the prompt gradient orthogonal projection in the ViT architecture shows completely different and greater challenges, i.e., 1) the high-order and non-linear self-attention operation; 2) the drift of prompt distribution brought by the LayerNorm in the transformer block. Theoretically, we have finally deduced two consistency conditions to achieve the prompt gradient orthogonal projection, which provide a theoretical guarantee of eliminating interference on previously learned knowledge via the self-attention mechanism in visual prompt tuning. In practice, an effective null-space-based approximation solution has been proposed to implement the prompt gradient orthogonal projection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of anti-forgetting on four class-incremental benchmarks with diverse pre-trained baseline models, and our approach achieves superior performances to state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available in the supplemental material.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Exhibit Human-Like Reasoning? Evaluating Theory of Mind in LLMs for Open-Ended Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning entails recognizing that other individuals possess their own intentions, emotions, and thoughts, which is vital for guiding one's own thought processes. Although large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks such as summarization, question answering, and translation, they still face challenges with ToM reasoning, especially in open-ended questions. Despite advancements, the extent to which LLMs truly understand ToM reasoning and how closely it aligns with human ToM reasoning remains inadequately explored in open-ended scenarios. Motivated by this gap, we assess the abilities of LLMs to perceive and integrate human intentions and emotions into their ToM reasoning processes within open-ended questions. Our study utilizes posts from Reddit's ChangeMyView platform, which demands nuanced social reasoning to craft persuasive responses. Our analysis, comparing semantic similarity and lexical overlap metrics between responses generated by humans and LLMs, reveals clear disparities in ToM reasoning capabilities in open-ended questions, with even the most advanced models showing notable limitations. To enhance LLM capabilities, we implement a prompt tuning method that incorporates human intentions and emotions, resulting in improvements in ToM reasoning performance. However, despite these improvements, the enhancement still falls short of fully achieving human-like reasoning. This research highlights the deficiencies in LLMs' social reasoning and demonstrates how integrating human intentions and emotions can boost their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>From Basic to Extra Features: Hypergraph Transformer Pretrain-then-Finetuning for Balanced Clinical Predictions on EHR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich patient information and are crucial for clinical research and practice. In recent years, deep learning models have been applied to EHRs, but they often rely on massive features, which may not be readily available for all patients. We propose HTP-Star, which leverages hypergraph structures with a pretrain-then-finetune framework for modeling EHR data, enabling seamless integration of additional features. Additionally, we design two techniques, namely (1) Smoothness-inducing Regularization and (2) Group-balanced Reweighting, to enhance the model's robustness during fine-tuning. Through experiments conducted on two real EHR datasets, we demonstrate that HTP-Star consistently outperforms various baselines while striking a balance between patients with basic and extra features.</description>

      <title>Peer Review as A Multi-Turn and Long-Context Dialogue with Role-Based Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated wide-ranging applications across various fields and have shown significant potential in the academic peer-review process. However, existing applications are primarily limited to static review generation based on submitted papers, which fail to capture the dynamic and iterative nature of real-world peer reviews. In this paper, we reformulate the peer-review process as a multi-turn, long-context dialogue, incorporating distinct roles for authors, reviewers, and decision makers. We construct a comprehensive dataset containing over 26,841 papers with 92,017 reviews collected from multiple sources, including the top-tier conference and prestigious journal. This dataset is meticulously designed to facilitate the applications of LLMs for multi-turn dialogues, effectively simulating the complete peer-review process. Furthermore, we propose a series of metrics to evaluate the performance of LLMs for each role under this reformulated peer-review setting, ensuring fair and comprehensive evaluations. We believe this work provides a promising perspective on enhancing the LLM-driven peer-review process by incorporating dynamic, role-based interactions. It aligns closely with the iterative and interactive nature of real-world academic peer review, offering a robust foundation for future research and development in this area. We open-source the dataset at https://github.com/chengtan9907/ReviewMT.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Noise Robustness for Flow-Matching-Based Zero-Shot TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems, capable of synthesizing any speaker's voice from a short audio prompt, have made rapid advancements. However, the quality of the generated speech significantly deteriorates when the audio prompt contains noise, and limited research has been conducted to address this issue. In this paper, we explored various strategies to enhance the quality of audio generated from noisy audio prompts within the context of flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS. Our investigation includes comprehensive training strategies: unsupervised pre-training with masked speech denoising, multi-speaker detection and DNSMOS-based data filtering on the pre-training data, and fine-tuning with random noise mixing. The results of our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in intelligibility, speaker similarity, and overall audio quality compared to the approach of applying speech enhancement to the audio prompt.</description>

      <title>QGEval: A Benchmark for Question Generation Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically generated questions often suffer from problems such as unclear expression or factual inaccuracies, requiring a reliable and comprehensive evaluation of their quality. Human evaluation is frequently used in the field of question generation (QG) and is one of the most accurate evaluation methods. It also serves as the standard for automatic metrics. However, there is a lack of unified evaluation criteria, which hampers the development of both QG technologies and automatic evaluation methods. To address this, we propose QGEval, a multi-dimensional Evaluation benchmark for Question Generation, which evaluates both generated questions and existing automatic metrics across 7 dimensions: fluency, clarity, conciseness, relevance, consistency, answerability, and answer consistency. We demonstrate the appropriateness of these dimensions by examining their correlations and distinctions. Analysis with QGEval reveals that 1) most QG models perform unsatisfactorily in terms of answerability and answer consistency, and 2) existing metrics fail to align well with human assessments when evaluating generated questions across the 7 dimensions. We expect this work to foster the development of both QG technologies and automatic metrics for QG.</description>

      <title>Deception Analysis with Artificial Intelligence: An Interdisciplinary Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans and machines interact more frequently than ever and our societies are becoming increasingly hybrid. A consequence of this hybridisation is the degradation of societal trust due to the prevalence of AI-enabled deception. Yet, despite our understanding of the role of trust in AI in the recent years, we still do not have a computational theory to be able to fully understand and explain the role deception plays in this context. This is a problem because while our ability to explain deception in hybrid societies is delayed, the design of AI agents may keep advancing towards fully autonomous deceptive machines, which would pose new challenges to dealing with deception. In this paper we build a timely and meaningful interdisciplinary perspective on deceptive AI and reinforce a 20 year old socio-cognitive perspective on trust and deception, by proposing the development of DAMAS -- a holistic Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) framework for the socio-cognitive modelling and analysis of deception. In a nutshell this paper covers the topic of modelling and explaining deception using AI approaches from the perspectives of Computer Science, Philosophy, Psychology, Ethics, and Intelligence Analysis.</description>

      <title>Structured Learning of Compositional Sequential Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider sequential treatment regimes where each unit is exposed to combinations of interventions over time. When interventions are described by qualitative labels, such as ``close schools for a month due to a pandemic'' or ``promote this podcast to this user during this week'', it is unclear which appropriate structural assumptions allow us to generalize behavioral predictions to previously unseen combinatorial sequences. Standard black-box approaches mapping sequences of categorical variables to outputs are applicable, but they rely on poorly understood assumptions on how reliable generalization can be obtained, and may underperform under sparse sequences, temporal variability, and large action spaces. To approach that, we pose an explicit model for \emph{composition}, that is, how the effect of sequential interventions can be isolated into modules, clarifying which data conditions allow for the identification of their combined effect at different units and time steps. We show the identification properties of our compositional model, inspired by advances in causal matrix factorization methods but focusing on predictive models for novel compositions of interventions instead of matrix completion tasks and causal effect estimation. We compare our approach to flexible but generic black-box models to illustrate how structure aids prediction in sparse data conditions.</description>

      <title>Grounding Continuous Representations in Geometry: Equivariant Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Neural Fields have emerged as a powerful modelling paradigm to represent continuous signals. In a conditional neural field, a field is represented by a latent variable that conditions the NeF, whose parametrisation is otherwise shared over an entire dataset. We propose Equivariant Neural Fields based on cross attention transformers, in which NeFs are conditioned on a geometric conditioning variable, a latent point cloud, that enables an equivariant decoding from latent to field. Our equivariant approach induces a steerability property by which both field and latent are grounded in geometry and amenable to transformation laws if the field transforms, the latent represents transforms accordingly and vice versa. Crucially, the equivariance relation ensures that the latent is capable of (1) representing geometric patterns faitfhully, allowing for geometric reasoning in latent space, (2) weightsharing over spatially similar patterns, allowing for efficient learning of datasets of fields. These main properties are validated using classification experiments and a verification of the capability of fitting entire datasets, in comparison to other non-equivariant NeF approaches. We further validate the potential of ENFs by demonstrate unique local field editing properties.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of a PDE arising from prediction with expert advice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the online machine learning problem of prediction with expert advice in an adversarial setting through numerical analysis of, and experiments with, a related partial differential equation. The problem is a repeated two-person game involving decision-making at each step informed by $n$ experts in an adversarial environment. The continuum limit of this game over a large number of steps is a degenerate elliptic equation whose solution encodes the optimal strategies for both players. We develop numerical methods for approximating the solution of this equation in relatively high dimensions ($n\leq 10$) by exploiting symmetries in the equation and the solution to drastically reduce the size of the computational domain. Based on our numerical results we make a number of conjectures about the optimality of various adversarial strategies, in particular about the non-optimality of the COMB strategy.</description>

      <title>Gentle-CLIP: Exploring Aligned Semantic In Low-Quality Multimodal Data With Soft Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal fusion breaks through the barriers between diverse modalities and has already yielded numerous impressive performances. However, in various specialized fields, it is struggling to obtain sufficient alignment data for the training process, which seriously limits the use of previously elegant models. Thus, semi-supervised learning attempts to achieve multimodal alignment with fewer matched pairs but traditional methods like pseudo-labeling are difficult to apply in domains with no label information. To address these problems, we transform semi-supervised multimodal alignment into a manifold matching problem and propose a new method based on CLIP, named Gentle-CLIP. Specifically, we design a novel semantic density distribution loss to explore implicit semantic alignment information from unpaired multimodal data by constraining the latent representation distribution with fine granularity, thus eliminating the need for numerous strictly matched pairs. Meanwhile, we introduce multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy as well as self-supervised contrastive loss to pull separate modality distributions closer and enhance the stability of the representation distribution. In addition, the contrastive loss used in CLIP is employed on the supervised matched data to prevent negative optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on a range of tasks in various fields, including protein, remote sensing, and the general vision-language field, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Gentle-CLIP.</description>

      <title>MLCM: Multistep Consistency Distillation of Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distilling large latent diffusion models (LDMs) into ones that are fast to sample from is attracting growing research interest. However, the majority of existing methods face a dilemma where they either (i) depend on multiple individual distilled models for different sampling budgets, or (ii) sacrifice generation quality with limited (e.g., 2-4) and/or moderate (e.g., 5-8) sampling steps. To address these, we extend the recent multistep consistency distillation (MCD) strategy to representative LDMs, establishing the Multistep Latent Consistency Models (MLCMs) approach for low-cost high-quality image synthesis. MLCM serves as a unified model for various sampling steps due to the promise of MCD. We further augment MCD with a progressive training strategy to strengthen inter-segment consistency to boost the quality of few-step generations. We take the states from the sampling trajectories of the teacher model as training data for MLCMs to lift the requirements for high-quality training datasets and to bridge the gap between the training and inference of the distilled model. MLCM is compatible with preference learning strategies for further improvement of visual quality and aesthetic appeal. Empirically, MLCM can generate high-quality, delightful images with only 2-8 sampling steps. On the MSCOCO-2017 5K benchmark, MLCM distilled from SDXL gets a CLIP Score of 33.30, Aesthetic Score of 6.19, and Image Reward of 1.20 with only 4 steps, substantially surpassing 4-step LCM [23], 8-step SDXL-Lightning [17], and 8-step HyperSD [33]. We also demonstrate the versatility of MLCMs in applications including controllable generation, image style transfer, and Chinese-to-image generation.</description>

      <title>RE-RAG: Improving Open-Domain QA Performance and Interpretability with Relevance Estimator in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frame work is showing state-of-the-art performance on open-domain question answering tasks by referencing external knowledge. However, the RAG system faces challenges with performance degradation when it is fed contexts of low relevance or when the relative relevance among the input contexts is inaccurately assessed. In this work, we propose a RE-RAG framework that injects an explicit context relevance estimator (RE) into the RAG system. RE-RAG re-evaluates the retrieved contexts with the proposed context RE and passes the more relevant contexts along with their measure importance to the generator. To train context RE, we propose an unsupervised learning method, which does not utilize any labeled document ranking data to train the context RE. To examine the efficacy of RE-RAG, we examine its performance on Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets. RE-RAG achieves on-par performance compared to the FiD variants while utilizing fewer contexts (0.25x). We show that the proposed context RE, which was trained with the T5 model, is also applicable to RAG with LLMs(ChatGPT) by improving the performance on NQ (+6.4EM) and TQA (+2.8EM), respecitvely. Lastly, we display that RE can add interpretability to RAG framework as RE score highly correlates with the RE-RAG accuracy. Consequently, RE can be utilized to filter out unanswerable scenarios where context does not contain answers with 38.9%-51.3% accuracy just by examining a set of retrieved contexts.</description>

      <title>3D-MolT5: Towards Unified 3D Molecule-Text Modeling with 3D Molecular Tokenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of molecule and language has garnered increasing attention in molecular science. Recent advancements in Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated potential for the comprehensive modeling of molecule and language. However, existing works exhibit notable limitations. Most existing works overlook the modeling of 3D information, which is crucial for understanding molecular structures and also functions. While some attempts have been made to leverage external structure encoding modules to inject the 3D molecular information into LMs, there exist obvious difficulties that hinder the integration of molecular structure and language text, such as modality alignment and separate tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose 3D-MolT5, a unified framework designed to model both 1D molecular sequence and 3D molecular structure. The key innovation lies in our methodology for mapping fine-grained 3D substructure representations (based on 3D molecular fingerprints) to a specialized 3D token vocabulary for 3D-MolT5. This 3D structure token vocabulary enables the seamless combination of 1D sequence and 3D structure representations in a tokenized format, allowing 3D-MolT5 to encode molecular sequence (SELFIES), molecular structure, and text sequences within a unified architecture. Alongside, we further introduce 1D and 3D joint pre-training to enhance the model's comprehension of these diverse modalities in a joint representation space and better generalize to various tasks for our foundation model. Through instruction tuning on multiple downstream datasets, our proposed 3D-MolT5 shows superior performance than existing methods in molecular property prediction, molecule captioning, and text-based molecule generation tasks. Our code will be available on GitHub soon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the topology of representation manifolds arising in autoregressive neural language models trained on raw text data. In order to study their properties, we introduce tools from computational algebraic topology, which we use as a basis for a measure of topological complexity, that we call perforation.
  Using this measure, we study the evolution of topological structure in GPT based large language models across depth and time during training. We then compare these to gated recurrent models, and show that the latter exhibit more topological complexity, with a distinct pattern of changes common to all natural languages but absent from synthetically generated data. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the representation manifolds derived by these models based on studying the shapes of vector clouds induced by them as they are conditioned on sentences from corpora of natural language text.
  The methods developed in this paper are novel in the field and based on mathematical apparatus that might be unfamiliar to the target audience. To help with that we introduce the minimum necessary theory, and provide additional visualizations in the appendices.
  The main contribution of the paper is a striking observation about the topological structure of the transformer as compared to LSTM based neural architectures. It suggests that further research into mathematical properties of these neural networks is necessary to understand the operation of large transformer language models. We hope this work inspires further explorations in this direction within the NLP community.</description>

      <title>SAM-PM: Enhancing Video Camouflaged Object Detection using Spatio-Temporal Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of large foundation models, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained notable recognition for its exceptional performance in image segmentation. However, tackling the video camouflage object detection (VCOD) task presents a unique challenge. Camouflaged objects typically blend into the background, making them difficult to distinguish in still images. Additionally, ensuring temporal consistency in this context is a challenging problem. As a result, SAM encounters limitations and falls short when applied to the VCOD task. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called the SAM Propagation Module (SAM-PM). Our propagation module enforces temporal consistency within SAM by employing spatio-temporal cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, we exclusively train the propagation module while keeping the SAM network weights frozen, allowing us to integrate task-specific insights with the vast knowledge accumulated by the large model. Our method effectively incorporates temporal consistency and domain-specific expertise into the segmentation network with an addition of less than 1% of SAM's parameters. Extensive experimentation reveals a substantial performance improvement in the VCOD benchmark when compared to the most recent state-of-the-art techniques.

      <title>Toward identifiability of total effects in summary causal graphs with latent confounders: an extension of the front-door criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conducting experiments to estimate total effects can be challenging due to cost, ethical concerns, or practical limitations. As an alternative, researchers often rely on causal graphs to determine if it is possible to identify these effects from observational data. Identifying total effects in fully specified non-temporal causal graphs has garnered considerable attention, with Pearl's front-door criterion enabling the identification of total effects in the presence of latent confounding even when no variable set is sufficient for adjustment. However, specifying a complete causal graph is challenging in many domains. Extending these identifiability results to partially specified graphs is crucial, particularly in dynamic systems where causal relationships evolve over time. This paper addresses the challenge of identifying total effects using a specific and well-known partially specified graph in dynamic systems called a summary causal graph, which does not specify the temporal lag between causal relations and can contain cycles. In particular, this paper presents sufficient graphical conditions for identifying total effects from observational data, even in the presence of hidden confounding and when no variable set is sufficient for adjustment, contributing to the ongoing effort to understand and estimate causal effects from observational data using summary causal graphs.</description>

      <title>Seventeenth-Century Spanish American Notary Records for Fine-Tuning Spanish Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have gained tremendous popularity in domains such as e-commerce, finance, healthcare, and education. Fine-tuning is a common approach to customize an LLM on a domain-specific dataset for a desired downstream task. In this paper, we present a valuable resource for fine-tuning LLMs developed for the Spanish language to perform a variety of tasks such as classification, masked language modeling, clustering, and others. Our resource is a collection of handwritten notary records from the seventeenth century obtained from the National Archives of Argentina. This collection contains a combination of original images and transcribed text (and metadata) of 160+ pages that were handwritten by two notaries, namely, Estenban Agreda de Vergara and Nicolas de Valdivia y Brisuela nearly 400 years ago. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our collection can be used to fine-tune Spanish LLMs for tasks such as classification and masked language modeling, and can outperform pre-trained Spanish models and ChatGPT-3.5/ChatGPT-4o. Our resource will be an invaluable resource for historical text analysis and is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Unified Text-to-Image Generation and Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How humans can efficiently and effectively acquire images has always been a perennial question. A typical solution is text-to-image retrieval from an existing database given the text query; however, the limited database typically lacks creativity. By contrast, recent breakthroughs in text-to-image generation have made it possible to produce fancy and diverse visual content, but it faces challenges in synthesizing knowledge-intensive images. In this work, we rethink the relationship between text-to-image generation and retrieval and propose a unified framework in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we first explore the intrinsic discriminative abilities of MLLMs and introduce a generative retrieval method to perform retrieval in a training-free manner. Subsequently, we unify generation and retrieval in an autoregressive generation way and propose an autonomous decision module to choose the best-matched one between generated and retrieved images as the response to the text query. Additionally, we construct a benchmark called TIGeR-Bench, including creative and knowledge-intensive domains, to standardize the evaluation of unified text-to-image generation and retrieval. Extensive experimental results on TIGeR-Bench and two retrieval benchmarks, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>PSBD: Prediction Shift Uncertainty Unlocks Backdoor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries manipulate model predictions by inserting malicious samples into the training data. Currently, there is still a lack of direct filtering methods for identifying suspicious training data to unveil potential backdoor samples. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Prediction Shift Backdoor Detection (PSBD), leveraging an uncertainty-based approach requiring minimal unlabeled clean validation data. PSBD is motivated by an intriguing Prediction Shift (PS) phenomenon, where poisoned models' predictions on clean data often shift away from true labels towards certain other labels with dropout applied during inference, while backdoor samples exhibit less PS. We hypothesize PS results from neuron bias effect, making neurons favor features of certain classes. PSBD identifies backdoor training samples by computing the Prediction Shift Uncertainty (PSU), the variance in probability values when dropout layers are toggled on and off during model inference. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of PSBD, which achieves state-of-the-art results among mainstream detection methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stain Multi-Level Convolutional Network for Multi-Tissue Breast Cancer Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital pathology and microscopy image analysis are widely employed in the segmentation of digitally scanned IHC slides, primarily to identify cancer and pinpoint regions of interest (ROI) indicative of tumor presence. However, current ROI segmentation models are either stain-specific or suffer from the issues of stain and scanner variance due to different staining protocols or modalities across multiple labs. Also, tissues like Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), acini, etc. are often classified as Tumors due to their structural similarities and color compositions. In this paper, we proposed a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based Multi-class Tissue Segmentation model for histopathology whole-slide Breast slides which classify tumors and segments other tissue regions such as Ducts, acini, DCIS, Squamous epithelium, Blood Vessels, Necrosis, etc. as a separate class. Our unique pixel-aligned non-linear merge across spatial resolutions empowers models with both local and global fields of view for accurate detection of various classes. Our proposed model is also able to separate bad regions such as folds, artifacts, blurry regions, bubbles, etc. from tissue regions using multi-level context from different resolutions of WSI. Multi-phase iterative training with context-aware augmentation and increasing noise was used to efficiently train a multi-stain generic model with partial and noisy annotations from 513 slides. Our training pipeline used 12 million patches generated using context-aware augmentations which made our model stain and scanner invariant across data sources. To extrapolate stain and scanner invariance, our model was evaluated on 23000 patches which were for a completely new stain (Hematoxylin and Eosin) from a completely new scanner (Motic) from a different lab. The mean IOU was 0.72 which is on par with model performance on other data sources and scanners.</description>

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution for the semantic segmentation in adverse weather, in UG2+ Challenge at CVPR 2024. To achieve robust and accurate segmentation results across various weather conditions, we initialize the InternImage-H backbone with pre-trained weights from the large-scale joint dataset and enhance it with the state-of-the-art Upernet segmentation method. Specifically, we utilize offline and online data augmentation approaches to extend the train set, which helps us to further improve the performance of the segmenter. As a result, our proposed solution demonstrates advanced performance on the test set and achieves 3rd position in this challenge.</description>

      <title>MaLa-ASR: Multimedia-Assisted LLM-Based ASR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As more and more information-rich data like video become available, utilizing multi-modal auxiliary information to enhance audio tasks has sparked widespread research interest. The recent surge in research on LLM-based audio models provides fresh perspectives for tackling audio tasks. Given that LLM can flexibly ingest multiple inputs, we propose MaLa-ASR, an LLM-based ASR model that can integrate textual keywords extracted from presentation slides to improve recognition of conference content. MaLa-ASR yields average WERs of 9.4% and 11.7% on the L95 and S95 subsets of the SlideSpeech corpus, representing a significant relative WER drop of 27.9% and 44.7% over the baseline model reported in SlideSpeech. MaLa-ASR underscores LLM's strong performance in speech tasks and the capability to integrate auxiliary information conveniently. By adding keywords to the input prompt, the biased word error rate (B-WER) reduces relatively by 46.0% and 44.2%, establishing a new SOTA on this dataset.</description>

      <title>Self-Distilled Disentangled Learning for Counterfactual Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancements in disentangled representation learning significantly enhance the accuracy of counterfactual predictions by granting precise control over instrumental variables, confounders, and adjustable variables. An appealing method for achieving the independent separation of these factors is mutual information minimization, a task that presents challenges in numerous machine learning scenarios, especially within high-dimensional spaces. To circumvent this challenge, we propose the Self-Distilled Disentanglement framework, referred to as $SD^2$. Grounded in information theory, it ensures theoretically sound independent disentangled representations without intricate mutual information estimator designs for high-dimensional representations. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirms the effectiveness of our approach in facilitating counterfactual inference in the presence of both observed and unobserved confounders.</description>

      <title>II-Bench: An Image Implication Understanding Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in the development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have consistently led to new breakthroughs on various benchmarks. In response, numerous challenging and comprehensive benchmarks have been proposed to more accurately assess the capabilities of MLLMs. However, there is a dearth of exploration of the higher-order perceptual capabilities of MLLMs. To fill this gap, we propose the Image Implication understanding Benchmark, II-Bench, which aims to evaluate the model's higher-order perception of images. Through extensive experiments on II-Bench across multiple MLLMs, we have made significant findings. Initially, a substantial gap is observed between the performance of MLLMs and humans on II-Bench. The pinnacle accuracy of MLLMs attains 74.8%, whereas human accuracy averages 90%, peaking at an impressive 98%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on abstract and complex images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and capture image details. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy when image sentiment polarity hints are incorporated into the prompts. This observation underscores a notable deficiency in their inherent understanding of image sentiment. We believe that II-Bench will inspire the community to develop the next generation of MLLMs, advancing the journey towards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI). II-Bench is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/II-Bench.</description>

Abstract: This paper discusses a simple and effective method for the summation of long sequences of floating point numbers. The method comprises two phases: an accumulation phase where the mantissas of the floating point numbers are added to accumulators indexed by the exponents and a reconstruction phase where the actual summation result is finalised. Various architectural details are given for both FPGAs and ASICs including fusing the operation with a multiplier, creating efficient MACs. Some results are presented for FPGAs, including a tensor core capable of multiplying and accumulating two 4x4 matrices of bfloat16 values every clock cycle using ~6,400 LUTs + 64 DSP48 in AMD FPGAs at 700+ MHz. The method is then extended to posits and logarithmic numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive fiction games have emerged as an important application to improve the generalization capabilities of language-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Existing environments for interactive fiction games are domain-specific or time-consuming to generate and do not train the RL agents to master a specific set of skills. In this work, we introduce an interactive environment for self-supervised RL, STARLING, for text-based games that bootstraps the text-based RL agents with automatically generated games (based on the seed set of game ideas) to boost the performance and generalization capabilities to reach a goal of the target environment. These games let the agent hone their skills on a predefined set of tasks. We create and test an environment with 100 games, generated using this automated framework that uses large language models (GPT-3) and an interactive fiction game engine (based on Inform7) to provide the user with the ability to generate more games under minimal human supervision. Experimental results based on both the human participants and baseline text-based RL agents reveal that current state-of-the-art text-based RL agents cannot use previously learned skills in new situations at the level humans can. These results enforce STARLING's potential to serve as a sandbox environment for further research in self-supervised text-based RL.</description>

      <title>Conserving Human Creativity with Evolutionary Generative Algorithms: A Case Study in Music Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of evolutionary generative algorithms in music production to preserve and enhance human creativity. By integrating human feedback into Differential Evolution algorithms, we produced six songs that were submitted to international record labels, all of which received contract offers. In addition to testing the commercial viability of these methods, this paper examines the long-term implications of content generation using traditional machine learning methods compared with evolutionary algorithms. Specifically, as current generative techniques continue to scale, the potential for computer-generated content to outpace human creation becomes likely. This trend poses a risk of exhausting the pool of human-created training data, potentially forcing generative machine learning models to increasingly depend on their random input functions for generating novel content. In contrast to a future of content generation guided by aimless random functions, our approach allows for individualized creative exploration, ensuring that computer-assisted content generation methods are human-centric and culturally relevant through time.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Load Forecasting Under Data Scarcity in Smart Grids: A Meta-Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of smart grids and large volumes of data at the individual consumer level, there are still various cases where adequate data collection to train accurate load forecasting models is challenging or even impossible. This paper proposes adapting an established model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm for short-term load forecasting in the context of few-shot learning. Specifically, the proposed method can rapidly adapt and generalize within any unknown load time series of arbitrary length using only minimal training samples. In this context, the meta-learning model learns an optimal set of initial parameters for a base-level learner recurrent neural network. The proposed model is evaluated using a dataset of historical load consumption data from real-world consumers. Despite the examined load series' short length, it produces accurate forecasts outperforming transfer learning and task-specific machine learning methods by $12.5\%$. To enhance robustness and fairness during model evaluation, a novel metric, mean average log percentage error, is proposed that alleviates the bias introduced by the commonly used MAPE metric. Finally, a series of studies to evaluate the model's robustness under different hyperparameters and time series lengths is also conducted, demonstrating that the proposed approach consistently outperforms all other models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User representation is crucial for recommendation systems as it helps to deliver personalized recommendations by capturing user preferences and behaviors in low-dimensional vectors. High-quality user embeddings can capture subtle preferences, enable precise similarity calculations, and adapt to changing preferences over time to maintain relevance. The effectiveness of recommendation systems depends significantly on the quality of user embedding. We propose to asynchronously learn high fidelity user embeddings for billions of users each day from sequence based multimodal user activities in Meta platforms through a Transformer-like large scale feature learning module. The async learned user representations embeddings (ALURE) are further converted to user similarity graphs through graph learning and then combined with user realtime activities to retrieval highly related ads candidates for the entire ads delivery system. Our method shows significant gains in both offline and online experiments.</description>

      <title>Whose Preferences? Differences in Fairness Preferences and Their Impact on the Fairness of AI Utilizing Human Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing body of work on learning from human feedback to align various aspects of machine learning systems with human values and preferences. We consider the setting of fairness in content moderation, in which human feedback is used to determine how two comments -- referencing different sensitive attribute groups -- should be treated in comparison to one another. With a novel dataset collected from Prolific and MTurk, we find significant gaps in fairness preferences depending on the race, age, political stance, educational level, and LGBTQ+ identity of annotators. We also demonstrate that demographics mentioned in text have a strong influence on how users perceive individual fairness in moderation. Further, we find that differences also exist in downstream classifiers trained to predict human preferences. Finally, we observe that an ensemble, giving equal weight to classifiers trained on annotations from different demographics, performs better for different demographic intersections; compared to a single classifier that gives equal weight to each annotation.</description>

      <title>TTM-RE: Memory-Augmented Document-Level Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document-level relation extraction aims to categorize the association between any two entities within a document. We find that previous methods for document-level relation extraction are ineffective in exploiting the full potential of large amounts of training data with varied noise levels. For example, in the ReDocRED benchmark dataset, state-of-the-art methods trained on the large-scale, lower-quality, distantly supervised training data generally do not perform better than those trained solely on the smaller, high-quality, human-annotated training data. To unlock the full potential of large-scale noisy training data for document-level relation extraction, we propose TTM-RE, a novel approach that integrates a trainable memory module, known as the Token Turing Machine, with a noisy-robust loss function that accounts for the positive-unlabeled setting. Extensive experiments on ReDocRED, a benchmark dataset for document-level relation extraction, reveal that TTM-RE achieves state-of-the-art performance (with an absolute F1 score improvement of over 3%). Ablation studies further illustrate the superiority of TTM-RE in other domains (the ChemDisGene dataset in the biomedical domain) and under highly unlabeled settings.</description>

      <title>BD-SAT: High-resolution Land Use Land Cover Dataset &amp; Benchmark Results for Developing Division: Dhaka, BD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Land Use Land Cover (LULC) analysis on satellite images using deep learning-based methods is significantly helpful in understanding the geography, socio-economic conditions, poverty levels, and urban sprawl in developing countries. Recent works involve segmentation with LULC classes such as farmland, built-up areas, forests, meadows, water bodies, etc. Training deep learning methods on satellite images requires large sets of images annotated with LULC classes. However, annotated data for developing countries are scarce due to a lack of funding, absence of dedicated residential/industrial/economic zones, a large population, and diverse building materials. BD-SAT provides a high-resolution dataset that includes pixel-by-pixel LULC annotations for Dhaka metropolitan city and surrounding rural/urban areas. Using a strict and standardized procedure, the ground truth is created using Bing satellite imagery with a ground spatial distance of 2.22 meters per pixel. A three-stage, well-defined annotation process has been followed with support from GIS experts to ensure the reliability of the annotations. We performed several experiments to establish benchmark results. The results show that the annotated BD-SAT is sufficient to train large deep learning models with adequate accuracy for five major LULC classes: forest, farmland, built-up areas, water bodies, and meadows.</description>

      <title>Why Don't Prompt-Based Fairness Metrics Correlate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of large language models has brought up essential questions about the potential biases these models might learn. This led to the development of several metrics aimed at evaluating and mitigating these biases. In this paper, we first demonstrate that prompt-based fairness metrics exhibit poor agreement, as measured by correlation, raising important questions about the reliability of fairness assessment using prompts. Then, we outline six relevant reasons why such a low correlation is observed across existing metrics. Based on these insights, we propose a method called Correlated Fairness Output (CAIRO) to enhance the correlation between fairness metrics. CAIRO augments the original prompts of a given fairness metric by using several pre-trained language models and then selects the combination of the augmented prompts that achieves the highest correlation across metrics. We show a significant improvement in Pearson correlation from 0.3 and 0.18 to 0.90 and 0.98 across metrics for gender and religion biases, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/chandar-lab/CAIRO.</description>

      <title>Hello Again! LLM-powered Personalized Agent for Long-term Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-domain dialogue systems have seen remarkable advancements with the development of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, most existing dialogue systems predominantly focus on brief single-session interactions, neglecting the real-world demands for long-term companionship and personalized interactions with chatbots. Crucial to addressing this real-world need are event summary and persona management, which enable reasoning for appropriate long-term dialogue responses. Recent progress in the human-like cognitive and reasoning capabilities of LLMs suggests that LLM-based agents could significantly enhance automated perception, decision-making, and problem-solving. In response to this potential, we introduce a model-agnostic framework, the Long-term Dialogue Agent (LD-Agent), which incorporates three independently tunable modules dedicated to event perception, persona extraction, and response generation. For the event memory module, long and short-term memory banks are employed to separately focus on historical and ongoing sessions, while a topic-based retrieval mechanism is introduced to enhance the accuracy of memory retrieval. Furthermore, the persona module conducts dynamic persona modeling for both users and agents. The integration of retrieved memories and extracted personas is subsequently fed into the generator to induce appropriate responses. The effectiveness, generality, and cross-domain capabilities of LD-Agent are empirically demonstrated across various illustrative benchmarks, models, and tasks. The code is released at https://github.com/leolee99/LD-Agent.</description>

      <title>Safety Alignment Should Be Made More Than Just a Few Tokens Deep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The safety alignment of current Large Language Models (LLMs) is vulnerable. Relatively simple attacks, or even benign fine-tuning, can jailbreak aligned models. We argue that many of these vulnerabilities are related to a shared underlying issue: safety alignment can take shortcuts, wherein the alignment adapts a model's generative distribution primarily over only its very first few output tokens. We refer to this issue as shallow safety alignment. In this paper, we present case studies to explain why shallow safety alignment can exist and provide evidence that current aligned LLMs are subject to this issue. We also show how these findings help explain multiple recently discovered vulnerabilities in LLMs, including the susceptibility to adversarial suffix attacks, prefilling attacks, decoding parameter attacks, and fine-tuning attacks. Importantly, we discuss how this consolidated notion of shallow safety alignment sheds light on promising research directions for mitigating these vulnerabilities. For instance, we show that deepening the safety alignment beyond just the first few tokens can often meaningfully improve robustness against some common exploits. Finally, we design a regularized finetuning objective that makes the safety alignment more persistent against fine-tuning attacks by constraining updates on initial tokens. Overall, we advocate that future safety alignment should be made more than just a few tokens deep.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Scrutiny: Detecting Backdoor Attacks for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks present significant threats to Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly with the rise of third-party services that offer API integration and prompt engineering. Untrustworthy third parties can plant backdoors into LLMs and pose risks to users by embedding malicious instructions into user queries. The backdoor-compromised LLM will generate malicious output when and input is embedded with a specific trigger predetermined by an attacker. Traditional defense strategies, which primarily involve model parameter fine-tuning and gradient calculation, are inadequate for LLMs due to their extensive computational and clean data requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, Chain-of-Scrutiny (CoS), to address these challenges. Backdoor attacks fundamentally create a shortcut from the trigger to the target output, thus lack reasoning support. Accordingly, CoS guides the LLMs to generate detailed reasoning steps for the input, then scrutinizes the reasoning process to ensure consistency with the final answer. Any inconsistency may indicate an attack. CoS only requires black-box access to LLM, offering a practical defense, particularly for API-accessible LLMs. It is user-friendly, enabling users to conduct the defense themselves. Driven by natural language, the entire defense process is transparent to users. We validate the effectiveness of CoS through extensive experiments across various tasks and LLMs. Additionally, experiments results shows CoS proves more beneficial for more powerful LLMs.</description>

      <title>Solution for SMART-101 Challenge of CVPR Multi-modal Algorithmic Reasoning Task 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the solution of HYU MLLAB KT Team to the Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task: SMART-101 CVPR 2024 Challenge is presented. Beyond conventional visual question-answering problems, the SMART-101 challenge aims to achieve human-level multimodal understanding by tackling complex visio-linguistic puzzles designed for children in the 6-8 age group. To solve this problem, we suggest two main ideas. First, to utilize the reasoning ability of a large-scale language model (LLM), the given visual cues (images) are grounded in the text modality. For this purpose, we generate highly detailed text captions that describe the context of the image and use these captions as input for the LLM. Second, due to the nature of puzzle images, which often contain various geometric visual patterns, we utilize an object detection algorithm to ensure these patterns are not overlooked in the captioning process. We employed the SAM algorithm, which can detect various-size objects, to capture the visual features of these geometric patterns and used this information as input for the LLM. Under the puzzle split configuration, we achieved an option selection accuracy Oacc of 29.5 on the test set and a weighted option selection accuracy (WOSA) of 27.1 on the challenge set.</description>

      <title>MakeSinger: A Semi-Supervised Training Method for Data-Efficient Singing Voice Synthesis via Classifier-free Diffusion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose MakeSinger, a semi-supervised training method for singing voice synthesis (SVS) via classifier-free diffusion guidance. The challenge in SVS lies in the costly process of gathering aligned sets of text, pitch, and audio data. MakeSinger enables the training of the diffusion-based SVS model from any speech and singing voice data regardless of its labeling, thereby enhancing the quality of generated voices with large amount of unlabeled data. At inference, our novel dual guiding mechanism gives text and pitch guidance on the reverse diffusion step by estimating the score of masked input. Experimental results show that the model trained in a semi-supervised manner outperforms other baselines trained only on the labeled data in terms of pronunciation, pitch accuracy and overall quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adding Text-to-Speech (TTS) data in training, the model can synthesize the singing voices of TTS speakers even without their singing voices.</description>

      <title>CVQA: Culturally-diverse Multilingual Visual Question Answering Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an important task in multimodal AI, and it is often used to test the ability of vision-language models to understand and reason on knowledge present in both visual and textual data. However, most of the current VQA models use datasets that are primarily focused on English and a few major world languages, with images that are typically Western-centric. While recent efforts have tried to increase the number of languages covered on VQA datasets, they still lack diversity in low-resource languages. More importantly, although these datasets often extend their linguistic range via translation or some other approaches, they usually keep images the same, resulting in narrow cultural representation. To address these limitations, we construct CVQA, a new Culturally-diverse multilingual Visual Question Answering benchmark, designed to cover a rich set of languages and cultures, where we engage native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process. As a result, CVQA includes culturally-driven images and questions from across 28 countries on four continents, covering 26 languages with 11 scripts, providing a total of 9k questions. We then benchmark several Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on CVQA, and show that the dataset is challenging for the current state-of-the-art models. This benchmark can serve as a probing evaluation suite for assessing the cultural capability and bias of multimodal models and hopefully encourage more research efforts toward increasing cultural awareness and linguistic diversity in this field.</description>

      <title>ShiftAddLLM: Accelerating Pretrained LLMs via Post-Training Multiplication-Less Reparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on language tasks but face challenges when deployed on resource-constrained devices due to their extensive parameters and reliance on dense multiplications, resulting in high memory demands and latency bottlenecks. Shift-and-add reparameterization offers a promising solution by replacing costly multiplications with hardware-friendly primitives in both the attention and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers of an LLM. However, current reparameterization techniques require training from scratch or full parameter fine-tuning to restore accuracy, which is resource-intensive for LLMs. To address this, we propose accelerating pretrained LLMs through post-training shift-and-add reparameterization, creating efficient multiplication-free models, dubbed ShiftAddLLM. Specifically, we quantize each weight matrix into binary matrices paired with group-wise scaling factors. The associated multiplications are reparameterized into (1) shifts between activations and scaling factors and (2) queries and adds according to the binary matrices. To reduce accuracy loss, we present a multi-objective optimization method to minimize both weight and output activation reparameterization errors. Additionally, based on varying sensitivity across layers to reparameterization, we develop an automated bit allocation strategy to further reduce memory usage and latency. Experiments on five LLM families and eight tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of ShiftAddLLM, achieving average perplexity improvements of 5.6 and 22.7 points at comparable or lower latency compared to the most competitive quantized LLMs at 3 and 2 bits, respectively, and more than 80% memory and energy reductions over the original LLMs. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/ShiftAddLLM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental health constitutes a complex and pervasive global challenge, affecting millions of lives and often leading to severe consequences. In this paper, we conduct a thorough survey to explore the intersection of data science, artificial intelligence, and mental healthcare, focusing on the recent developments of mental disorder detection through online social media (OSM). A significant portion of the population actively engages in OSM platforms, creating a vast repository of personal data that holds immense potential for mental health analytics. The paper navigates through traditional diagnostic methods, state-of-the-art data- and AI-driven research studies, and the emergence of explainable AI (XAI) models for mental healthcare. We review state-of-the-art machine learning methods, particularly those based on modern deep learning, while emphasising the need for explainability in healthcare AI models. The experimental design section provides insights into prevalent practices, including available datasets and evaluation approaches. We also identify key issues and challenges in the field and propose promising future research directions. As mental health decisions demand transparency, interpretability, and ethical considerations, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on advancing XAI in mental healthcare through social media. The comprehensive overview presented here aims to guide researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in developing the area of mental disorder detection.</description>

Abstract: Radiology report analysis provides valuable information that can aid with public health initiatives, and has been attracting increasing attention from the research community. In this work, we present a novel insight that the structure of a radiology report (namely, the Findings and Impression sections) offers different views of a radiology scan. Based on this intuition, we further propose a co-training approach, where two machine learning models are built upon the Findings and Impression sections, respectively, and use each other's information to boost performance with massive unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner. We conducted experiments in a public health surveillance study, and results show that our co-training approach is able to improve performance using the dual views and surpass competing supervised and semi-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>fSEAD: a Composable FPGA-based Streaming Ensemble Anomaly Detection Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning ensembles combine multiple base models to produce a more accurate output. They can be applied to a range of machine learning problems, including anomaly detection. In this paper, we investigate how to maximize the composability and scalability of an FPGA-based streaming ensemble anomaly detector (fSEAD). To achieve this, we propose a flexible computing architecture consisting of multiple partially reconfigurable regions, pblocks, which each implement anomaly detectors. Our proof-of-concept design supports three state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms: Loda, RS-Hash and xStream. Each algorithm is scalable, meaning multiple instances can be placed within a pblock to improve performance. Moreover, fSEAD is implemented using High-level synthesis (HLS), meaning further custom anomaly detectors can be supported. Pblocks are interconnected via an AXI-switch, enabling them to be composed in an arbitrary fashion before combining and merging results at run-time to create an ensemble that maximizes the use of FPGA resources and accuracy. Through utilizing reconfigurable Dynamic Function eXchange (DFX), the detector can be modified at run-time to adapt to changing environmental conditions. We compare fSEAD to an equivalent central processing unit (CPU) implementation using four standard datasets, with speed-ups ranging from $3\times$ to $8\times$.</description>

      <title>FLEUR: An Explainable Reference-Free Evaluation Metric for Image Captioning Using a Large Multimodal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing image captioning evaluation metrics focus on assigning a single numerical score to a caption by comparing it with reference captions. However, these methods do not provide an explanation for the assigned score. Moreover, reference captions are expensive to acquire. In this paper, we propose FLEUR, an explainable reference-free metric to introduce explainability into image captioning evaluation metrics. By leveraging a large multimodal model, FLEUR can evaluate the caption against the image without the need for reference captions, and provide the explanation for the assigned score. We introduce score smoothing to align as closely as possible with human judgment and to be robust to user-defined grading criteria. FLEUR achieves high correlations with human judgment across various image captioning evaluation benchmarks and reaches state-of-the-art results on Flickr8k-CF, COMPOSITE, and Pascal-50S within the domain of reference-free evaluation metrics. Our source code and results are publicly available at: https://github.com/Yebin46/FLEUR.</description>

      <title>Neuro-TransUNet: Segmentation of stroke lesion in MRI using transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the stroke lesions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is associated with difficulties due to the complicated anatomy of the brain and the different properties of the lesions. This study introduces the Neuro-TransUNet framework, which synergizes the U-Net's spatial feature extraction with SwinUNETR's global contextual processing ability, further enhanced by advanced feature fusion and segmentation synthesis techniques. The comprehensive data pre-processing pipeline improves the framework's efficiency, which involves resampling, bias correction, and data standardization, enhancing data quality and consistency. Ablation studies confirm the significant impact of the advanced integration of U-Net with SwinUNETR and data pre-processing pipelines on performance and demonstrate the model's effectiveness. The proposed Neuro-TransUNet model, trained with the ATLAS v2.0 \emph{training} dataset, outperforms existing deep learning algorithms and establishes a new benchmark in stroke lesion segmentation.</description>

      <title>Investigating Pre-Training Objectives for Generalization in Vision-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, various pre-training methods have been introduced in vision-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, their generalization ability remains unclear due to evaluations being limited to in-distribution environments and non-unified experimental setups. To address this, we introduce the Atari Pre-training Benchmark (Atari-PB), which pre-trains a ResNet-50 model on 10 million transitions from 50 Atari games and evaluates it across diverse environment distributions. Our experiments show that pre-training objectives focused on learning task-agnostic features (e.g., identifying objects and understanding temporal dynamics) enhance generalization across different environments. In contrast, objectives focused on learning task-specific knowledge (e.g., identifying agents and fitting reward functions) improve performance in environments similar to the pre-training dataset but not in varied ones. We publicize our codes, datasets, and model checkpoints at https://github.com/dojeon-ai/Atari-PB.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Efficient Data with Diffusion Models for Person Re-Identification Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing person re-identification (Re-ID) methods principally deploy the ImageNet-1K dataset for model initialization, which inevitably results in sub-optimal situations due to the large domain gap. One of the key challenges is that building large-scale person Re-ID datasets is time-consuming. Some previous efforts address this problem by collecting person images from the internet e.g., LUPerson, but it struggles to learn from unlabeled, uncontrollable, and noisy data. In this paper, we present a novel paradigm Diffusion-ReID to efficiently augment and generate diverse images based on known identities without requiring any cost of data collection and annotation. Technically, this paradigm unfolds in two stages: generation and filtering. During the generation stage, we propose Language Prompts Enhancement (LPE) to ensure the ID consistency between the input image sequence and the generated images. In the diffusion process, we propose a Diversity Injection (DI) module to increase attribute diversity. In order to make the generated data have higher quality, we apply a Re-ID confidence threshold filter to further remove the low-quality images. Benefiting from our proposed paradigm, we first create a new large-scale person Re-ID dataset Diff-Person, which consists of over 777K images from 5,183 identities. Next, we build a stronger person Re-ID backbone pre-trained on our Diff-Person. Extensive experiments are conducted on four person Re-ID benchmarks in six widely used settings. Compared with other pre-training and self-supervised competitors, our approach shows significant superiority.</description>

      <title>Robust Latent Representation Tuning for Image-text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large models have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities in computer vision and natural language processing. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing these models with multimodal processing abilities. However, addressing the challenges posed by scenarios where one modality is absent remains a significant hurdle. In response to this issue, we propose a robust latent representation tuning method for large models. Specifically, our approach introduces a modality latent translation module to maximize the correlation between modalities. Following this, a newly designed fusion module is employed to facilitate information interaction between the modalities. In this framework, not only are common semantics refined during training, but the method also yields robust representations in the absence of one modality. Importantly, our method maintains the frozen state of the image and text foundation models to preserve their abilities acquired through large-scale pretraining. We conduct experiments on several public datasets, and the results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Greedy SLIM: A SLIM-Based Approach For Preference Elicitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference elicitation is an active learning approach to tackle the cold-start problem of recommender systems. Roughly speaking, new users are asked to rate some carefully selected items in order to compute appropriate recommendations for them. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a method for preference elicitation that is based on SLIM , a state-of-the-art technique for top-N recommendation. Our approach mainly consists of a new training technique for SLIM, which we call Greedy SLIM. This technique iteratively selects items for the training in order to minimize the SLIM loss greedily. We conduct offline experiments as well as a user study to assess the performance of this new method. The results are remarkable, especially with respect to the user study. We conclude that Greedy SLIM seems to be more suitable for preference elicitation than widely used methods based on latent factor models.</description>

      <title>ProcessPainter: Learn Painting Process from Sequence Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The painting process of artists is inherently stepwise and varies significantly among different painters and styles. Generating detailed, step-by-step painting processes is essential for art education and research, yet remains largely underexplored. Traditional stroke-based rendering methods break down images into sequences of brushstrokes, yet they fall short of replicating the authentic processes of artists, with limitations confined to basic brushstroke modifications. Text-to-image models utilizing diffusion processes generate images through iterative denoising, also diverge substantially from artists' painting process. To address these challenges, we introduce ProcessPainter, a text-to-video model that is initially pre-trained on synthetic data and subsequently fine-tuned with a select set of artists' painting sequences using the LoRA model. This approach successfully generates painting processes from text prompts for the first time. Furthermore, we introduce an Artwork Replication Network capable of accepting arbitrary-frame input, which facilitates the controlled generation of painting processes, decomposing images into painting sequences, and completing semi-finished artworks. This paper offers new perspectives and tools for advancing art education and image generation technology.</description>

      <title>StreamAtt: Direct Streaming Speech-to-Text Translation with Attention-based Audio History Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Streaming speech-to-text translation (StreamST) is the task of automatically translating speech while incrementally receiving an audio stream. Unlike simultaneous ST (SimulST), which deals with pre-segmented speech, StreamST faces the challenges of handling continuous and unbounded audio streams. This requires additional decisions about what to retain of the previous history, which is impractical to keep entirely due to latency and computational constraints. Despite the real-world demand for real-time ST, research on streaming translation remains limited, with existing works solely focusing on SimulST. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamAtt, the first StreamST policy, and propose StreamLAAL, the first StreamST latency metric designed to be comparable with existing metrics for SimulST. Extensive experiments across all 8 languages of MuST-C v1.0 show the effectiveness of StreamAtt compared to a naive streaming baseline and the related state-of-the-art SimulST policy, providing a first step in StreamST research.</description>

Abstract: Shared control in assistive robotics blends human autonomy with computer assistance, thus simplifying complex tasks for individuals with physical impairments. This study assesses an adaptive Degrees of Freedom control method specifically tailored for individuals with upper limb impairments. It employs a between-subjects analysis with 24 participants, conducting 81 trials across three distinct input devices in a realistic everyday-task setting. Given the diverse capabilities of the vulnerable target demographic and the known challenges in statistical comparisons due to individual differences, the study focuses primarily on subjective qualitative data. The results reveal consistently high success rates in trial completions, irrespective of the input device used. Participants appreciated their involvement in the research process, displayed a positive outlook, and quick adaptability to the control system. Notably, each participant effectively managed the given task within a short time frame.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Context Compression: Efficiently Expanding the Context Window of LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To extend the context length of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) and improve comprehension capabilities, we often face limitations due to computational resources and bounded memory storage capacity. This work introduces a method called Recurrent Context Compression (RCC), designed to efficiently expand the context window length of LLMs within constrained storage space. We also investigate the issue of poor model responses when both instructions and context are compressed in downstream tasks, and propose an instruction reconstruction method to mitigate this problem. We validated the effectiveness of our approach on multiple tasks, achieving a compression rate of up to 32x on text reconstruction tasks with a BLEU4 score close to 0.95, and nearly 100\% accuracy on a passkey retrieval task with a sequence length of 1M. Finally, our method demonstrated competitive performance in long-text question-answering tasks compared to non-compressed methods, while significantly saving storage resources in long-text inference tasks. Our code, models, and demo are available at https://github.com/WUHU-G/RCC_Transformer</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-autoregressive GAN-based neural vocoders are widely used due to their fast inference speed and high perceptual quality. However, they often suffer from audible artifacts such as tonal artifacts in their generated results. Therefore, we propose JenGAN, a new training strategy that involves stacking shifted low-pass filters to ensure the shift-equivariant property. This method helps prevent aliasing and reduce artifacts while preserving the model structure used during inference. In our experimental evaluation, JenGAN consistently enhances the performance of vocoder models, yielding significantly superior scores across the majority of evaluation metrics.</description>

Abstract: Large language models have limited context capacity, hindering reasoning over long conversations. We propose the Hierarchical Aggregate Tree memory structure to recursively aggregate relevant dialogue context through conditional tree traversals. HAT encapsulates information from children nodes, enabling broad coverage with depth control. We formulate finding best context as optimal tree traversal. Experiments show HAT improves dialog coherence and summary quality over baseline contexts, demonstrating the techniques effectiveness for multi turn reasoning without exponential parameter growth. This memory augmentation enables more consistent, grounded longform conversations from LLMs</description>

      <title>Comparing Data Augmentation Methods for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialog Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating effective and reliable task-oriented dialog systems (ToDSs) is challenging, not only because of the complex structure of these systems, but also due to the scarcity of training data, especially when several modules need to be trained separately, each one with its own input/output training examples. Data augmentation (DA), whereby synthetic training examples are added to the training data, has been successful in other NLP systems, but has not been explored as extensively in ToDSs. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of DA methods in an end-to-end ToDS setting, where a single system is trained to handle all processing stages, from user inputs to system outputs. We experiment with two ToDSs (UBAR, GALAXY) on two datasets (MultiWOZ, KVRET). We consider three types of DA methods (word-level, sentence-level, dialog-level), comparing eight DA methods that have shown promising results in ToDSs and other NLP systems. We show that all DA methods considered are beneficial, and we highlight the best ones, also providing advice to practitioners. We also introduce a more challenging few-shot cross-domain ToDS setting, reaching similar conclusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset bias is a significant challenge in machine learning, where specific attributes, such as texture or color of the images are unintentionally learned resulting in detrimental performance. To address this, previous efforts have focused on debiasing models either by developing novel debiasing algorithms or by generating synthetic data to mitigate the prevalent dataset biases. However, generative approaches to date have largely relied on using bias-specific samples from the dataset, which are typically too scarce. In this work, we propose, DiffInject, a straightforward yet powerful method to augment synthetic bias-conflict samples using a pretrained diffusion model. This approach significantly advances the use of diffusion models for debiasing purposes by manipulating the latent space. Our framework does not require any explicit knowledge of the bias types or labelling, making it a fully unsupervised setting for debiasing. Our methodology demonstrates substantial result in effectively reducing dataset bias.</description>

      <title>Thunder : Unified Regression-Diffusion Speech Enhancement with a Single Reverse Step using Brownian Bridge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based speech enhancement has shown promising results, but can suffer from a slower inference time. Initializing the diffusion process with the enhanced audio generated by a regression-based model can be used to reduce the computational steps required. However, these approaches often necessitate a regression model, further increasing the system's complexity. We propose Thunder, a unified regression-diffusion model that utilizes the Brownian bridge process which can allow the model to act in both modes. The regression mode can be accessed by setting the diffusion time step closed to 1. However, the standard score-based diffusion modeling does not perform well in this setup due to gradient instability. To mitigate this problem, we modify the diffusion model to predict the clean speech instead of the score function, achieving competitive performance with a more compact model size and fewer reverse steps.</description>

      <title>Language Models Resist Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may exhibit undesirable behaviors. Recent efforts have focused on aligning these models to prevent harmful generation. Despite these efforts, studies have shown that even a well-conducted alignment process can be easily circumvented, whether intentionally or accidentally. Do alignment fine-tuning have robust effects on models, or are merely superficial? In this work, we answer this question through both theoretical and empirical means. Empirically, we demonstrate the elasticity of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Using compression theory, we formally derive that such fine-tuning process \textit{disproportionately} undermines alignment compared to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We conduct experimental validations to confirm the presence of elasticity across models of varying types and sizes. Specifically, we find that model performance declines rapidly before reverting to the pre-training distribution, after which the rate of decline drops significantly. We further reveal that elasticity positively correlates with increased model size and the expansion of pre-training data. Our discovery signifies the importance of taming the inherent elasticity of LLMs, thereby overcoming the resistance of LLMs to alignment finetuning.</description>

      <title>Get rich quick: exact solutions reveal how unbalanced initializations promote rapid feature learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from data, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing lazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how unbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature learning only occurs with balanced initializations, where all layers learn at similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced initializations to enhance efficient feature learning.</description>

      <title>Generalized Nested Latent Variable Models for Lossy Coding applied to Wind Turbine Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate-distortion optimization through neural networks has accomplished competitive results in compression efficiency and image quality. This learning-based approach seeks to minimize the compromise between compression rate and reconstructed image quality by automatically extracting and retaining crucial information, while discarding less critical details. A successful technique consists in introducing a deep hyperprior that operates within a 2-level nested latent variable model, enhancing compression by capturing complex data dependencies. This paper extends this concept by designing a generalized L-level nested generative model with a Markov chain structure. We demonstrate as L increases that a trainable prior is detrimental and explore a common dimensionality along the distinct latent variables to boost compression performance. As this structured framework can represent autoregressive coders, we outperform the hyperprior model and achieve state-of-the-art performance while reducing substantially the computational cost. Our experimental evaluation is performed on wind turbine scenarios to study its application on visual inspections</description>

      <title>AI Cat Narrator: Designing an AI Tool for Exploring the Shared World and Social Connection with a Cat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As technology continues to advance, the interaction between humans and cats is becoming more diverse. Our research introduces a new tool called the AI Cat Narrator, which offers a unique perspective on the shared lives of humans and cats. We combined the method of ethnography with fictional storytelling, using a defamiliarization strategy to merge real-world data seen through the eyes of cats with excerpts from cat literature. This combination serves as the foundation for a database to instruct the AI Cat Narrator in crafting alternative narrative. Our findings indicate that using defamiliarized data for training purposes significantly contributes to the development of characters that are both more empathetic and individualized. The contributions of our study are twofold: 1) proposing an innovative approach to prompting a reevaluation of living alongside cats; 2) establishing a collaborative, exploratory tool developed by humans, cats, and AI together.</description>

      <title>Implications for Governance in Public Perceptions of Societal-scale AI Risks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amid growing concerns over AI's societal risks--ranging from civilizational collapse to misinformation and systemic bias--this study explores the perceptions of AI experts and the general US registered voters on the likelihood and impact of 18 specific AI risks, alongside their policy preferences for managing these risks. While both groups favor international oversight over national or corporate governance, our survey reveals a discrepancy: voters perceive AI risks as both more likely and more impactful than experts, and also advocate for slower AI development. Specifically, our findings indicate that policy interventions may best assuage collective concerns if they attempt to more carefully balance mitigation efforts across all classes of societal-scale risks, effectively nullifying the near-vs-long-term debate over AI risks. More broadly, our results will serve not only to enable more substantive policy discussions for preventing and mitigating AI risks, but also to underscore the challenge of consensus building for effective policy implementation.</description>

      <title>2DP-2MRC: 2-Dimensional Pointer-based Machine Reading Comprehension Method for Multimodal Moment Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moment retrieval aims to locate the most relevant moment in an untrimmed video based on a given natural language query. Existing solutions can be roughly categorized into moment-based and clip-based methods. The former often involves heavy computations, while the latter, due to overlooking coarse-grained information, typically underperforms compared to moment-based models. Hence, this paper proposes a novel 2-Dimensional Pointer-based Machine Reading Comprehension for Moment Retrieval Choice (2DP-2MRC) model to address the issue of imprecise localization in clip-based methods while maintaining lower computational complexity than moment-based methods. Specifically, we introduce an AV-Encoder to capture coarse-grained information at moment and video levels. Additionally, a 2D pointer encoder module is introduced to further enhance boundary detection for target moment. Extensive experiments on the HiREST dataset demonstrate that 2DP-2MRC significantly outperforms existing baseline models.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has made significant progress in recent years, attracting immense interest not only in research laboratories but also in various industries. However, the application of quantum computing to solve real-world problems is still hampered by a number of challenges, including hardware limitations and a relatively under-explored landscape of quantum algorithms, especially when compared to the extensive development of classical computing. The design of quantum circuits, in particular parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), which contain learnable parameters optimized by classical methods, is a non-trivial and time-consuming task requiring expert knowledge. As a result, research on the automated generation of PQCs, known as quantum architecture search (QAS), has gained considerable interest. QAS focuses on the use of machine learning and optimization-driven techniques to generate PQCs tailored to specific problems and characteristics of quantum hardware. In this paper, we provide an overview of QAS methods by examining relevant research studies in the field. We discuss main challenges in designing and performing an automated search for an optimal PQC, and survey ways to address them to ease future research.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Theory of Regularization-Based Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a statistical analysis of regularization-based continual learning on a sequence of linear regression tasks, with emphasis on how different regularization terms affect the model performance. We first derive the convergence rate for the oracle estimator obtained as if all data were available simultaneously. Next, we consider a family of generalized $\ell_2$-regularization algorithms indexed by matrix-valued hyperparameters, which includes the minimum norm estimator and continual ridge regression as special cases. As more tasks are introduced, we derive an iterative update formula for the estimation error of generalized $\ell_2$-regularized estimators, from which we determine the hyperparameters resulting in the optimal algorithm. Interestingly, the choice of hyperparameters can effectively balance the trade-off between forward and backward knowledge transfer and adjust for data heterogeneity. Moreover, the estimation error of the optimal algorithm is derived explicitly, which is of the same order as that of the oracle estimator. In contrast, our lower bounds for the minimum norm estimator and continual ridge regression show their suboptimality. A byproduct of our theoretical analysis is the equivalence between early stopping and generalized $\ell_2$-regularization in continual learning, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we conduct experiments to complement our theory.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation in Earth Observation: A Diffusion Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) imagery poses a significant challenge, despite its critical role in enabling precise analysis and informed decision-making across various sectors. This scarcity is primarily due to atmospheric conditions, seasonal variations, and limited geographical coverage, which complicates the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EO. Data augmentation, a widely used technique in AI that involves generating additional data mainly through parameterized image transformations, has been employed to increase the volume and diversity of data. However, this method often falls short in generating sufficient diversity across key semantic axes, adversely affecting the accuracy of EO applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel four-stage approach aimed at improving the diversity of augmented data by integrating diffusion models. Our approach employs meta-prompts for instruction generation, harnesses general-purpose vision-language models for generating rich captions, fine-tunes an Earth Observation diffusion model, and iteratively augments data. We conducted extensive experiments using four different data augmentation techniques, and our approach consistently demonstrated improvements, outperforming the established augmentation methods, revealing its effectiveness in generating semantically rich and diverse EO images.</description>

      <title>Label-Looping: Highly Efficient Decoding for Transducers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient greedy decoding algorithm for Transducer inference. We propose a novel data structure using CUDA tensors to represent partial hypotheses in a batch that supports parallelized hypothesis manipulations. During decoding, our algorithm maximizes GPU parallelism by adopting a nested-loop design, where the inner loop consumes all blank predictions, while non-blank predictions are handled in the outer loop. Our algorithm is general-purpose and can work with both conventional Transducers and Token-and-Duration Transducers. Experiments show that the label-looping algorithm can bring a speedup up to 2.0X compared to conventional batched decoding algorithms when using batch size 32, and can be combined with other compiler or GPU call-related techniques to bring more speedup. We will open-source our implementation to benefit the research community.</description>

      <title>Modular Growth of Hierarchical Networks: Efficient, General, and Robust Curriculum Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural modularity is a pervasive feature of biological neural networks, which have been linked to several functional and computational advantages. Yet, the use of modular architectures in artificial neural networks has been relatively limited despite early successes. Here, we explore the performance and functional dynamics of a modular network trained on a memory task via an iterative growth curriculum. We find that for a given classical, non-modular recurrent neural network (RNN), an equivalent modular network will perform better across multiple metrics, including training time, generalizability, and robustness to some perturbations. We further examine how different aspects of a modular network's connectivity contribute to its computational capability. We then demonstrate that the inductive bias introduced by the modular topology is strong enough for the network to perform well even when the connectivity within modules is fixed and only the connections between modules are trained. Our findings suggest that gradual modular growth of RNNs could provide advantages for learning increasingly complex tasks on evolutionary timescales, and help build more scalable and compressible artificial networks.</description>

      <title>Is Value Functions Estimation with Classification Plug-and-play for Offline Reinforcement Learning?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), value functions are typically approximated using deep neural networks and trained via mean squared error regression objectives to fit the true value functions. Recent research has proposed an alternative approach, utilizing the cross-entropy classification objective, which has demonstrated improved performance and scalability of RL algorithms. However, existing study have not extensively benchmarked the effects of this replacement across various domains, as the primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of the concept across a broad spectrum of tasks, without delving into in-depth analysis. Our work seeks to empirically investigate the impact of such a replacement in an offline RL setup and analyze the effects of different aspects on performance. Through large-scale experiments conducted across a diverse range of tasks using different algorithms, we aim to gain deeper insights into the implications of this approach. Our results reveal that incorporating this change can lead to superior performance over state-of-the-art solutions for some algorithms in certain tasks, while maintaining comparable performance levels in other tasks, however for other algorithms this modification might lead to the dramatic performance drop. This findings are crucial for further application of classification approach in research and practical tasks.</description>

      <title>Tx-LLM: A Large Language Model for Therapeutics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing therapeutics is a lengthy and expensive process that requires the satisfaction of many different criteria, and AI models capable of expediting the process would be invaluable. However, the majority of current AI approaches address only a narrowly defined set of tasks, often circumscribed within a particular domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tx-LLM, a generalist large language model (LLM) fine-tuned from PaLM-2 which encodes knowledge about diverse therapeutic modalities. Tx-LLM is trained using a collection of 709 datasets that target 66 tasks spanning various stages of the drug discovery pipeline. Using a single set of weights, Tx-LLM simultaneously processes a wide variety of chemical or biological entities(small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, cell lines, diseases) interleaved with free-text, allowing it to predict a broad range of associated properties, achieving competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 43 out of 66 tasks and exceeding SOTA on 22. Among these, Tx-LLM is particularly powerful and exceeds best-in-class performance on average for tasks combining molecular SMILES representations with text such as cell line names or disease names, likely due to context learned during pretraining. We observe evidence of positive transfer between tasks with diverse drug types (e.g.,tasks involving small molecules and tasks involving proteins), and we study the impact of model size, domain finetuning, and prompting strategies on performance. We believe Tx-LLM represents an important step towards LLMs encoding biochemical knowledge and could have a future role as an end-to-end tool across the drug discovery development pipeline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces MedExQA, a novel benchmark in medical question-answering, to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) understanding of medical knowledge through explanations. By constructing datasets across five distinct medical specialties that are underrepresented in current datasets and further incorporating multiple explanations for each question-answer pair, we address a major gap in current medical QA benchmarks which is the absence of comprehensive assessments of LLMs' ability to generate nuanced medical explanations. Our work highlights the importance of explainability in medical LLMs, proposes an effective methodology for evaluating models beyond classification accuracy, and sheds light on one specific domain, speech language pathology, where current LLMs including GPT4 lack good understanding. Our results show generation evaluation with multiple explanations aligns better with human assessment, highlighting an opportunity for a more robust automated comprehension assessment for LLMs. To diversify open-source medical LLMs (currently mostly based on Llama2), this work also proposes a new medical model, MedPhi-2, based on Phi-2 (2.7B). The model outperformed medical LLMs based on Llama2-70B in generating explanations, showing its effectiveness in the resource-constrained medical domain. We will share our benchmark datasets and the trained model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables local devices to collaboratively learn a shared predictive model by only periodically sharing model parameters with a central aggregator. However, FL can be disadvantaged by statistical heterogeneity produced by the diversity in each local devices data distribution, which creates different levels of Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data. Furthermore, this can be more complex when optimising different combinations of FL parameters and choosing optimal aggregation. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of different FL training parameters and aggregators over various levels of statistical heterogeneity on three datasets. We propose a systematic data partition strategy to simulate different levels of statistical heterogeneity and a metric to measure the level of IID. Additionally, we empirically identify the best FL model and key parameters for datasets of different characteristics. On the basis of these, we present recommended guidelines for FL parameters and aggregators to optimise model performance under different levels of IID and with different datasets</description>

Abstract: Accurately predicting heart activity and other biological signals is crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. Given that speech is an outcome of multiple physiological systems, a significant body of work studied the acoustic correlates of heart activity. Recently, self-supervised models have excelled in speech-related tasks compared to traditional acoustic methods. However, the robustness of data-driven representations in predicting heart activity remained unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that self-supervised speech models outperform acoustic features in predicting heart activity parameters. We also emphasize the impact of individual variability on model generalizability. These findings underscore the value of data-driven representations in such tasks and the need for more speech-based physiological data to mitigate speaker-related challenges.</description>

Abstract: The HCI field has demonstrated a growing interest in leveraging emerging technologies to enrich urban experiences. However, insufficient studies investigate the experience and design space of AI image technology (AIGT) applications for playful urban interaction, despite its widespread adoption. To explore this gap, we conducted an exploratory study involving four participants who wandered and photographed within Eindhoven Centre and interacted with an image-to-image AI. Preliminary findings present their observations, the effect of their familiarity with places, and how AIGT becomes an explorer's tool or co-speculator. We then highlight AIGT's capability of supporting playfulness, reimaginations, and rediscoveries of places through defamiliarizing and familiarizing cityscapes. Additionally, we propose the metaphor AIGT as a 'tourist' to discuss its opportunities for engaging explorations and risks of stereotyping places. Collectively, our research provides initial empirical insights and design considerations, inspiring future HCI endeavors for creating urban play with generative AI.</description>

Abstract: Scientific innovation relies on detailed workflows, which include critical steps such as analyzing literature, generating ideas, validating these ideas, interpreting results, and inspiring follow-up research. However, scientific publications that document these workflows are extensive and unstructured. This makes it difficult for both human researchers and AI systems to effectively navigate and explore the space of scientific innovation. To address this issue, we introduce MASSW, a comprehensive text dataset on Multi-Aspect Summarization of Scientific Workflows. MASSW includes more than 152,000 peer-reviewed publications from 17 leading computer science conferences spanning the past 50 years. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we automatically extract five core aspects from these publications -- context, key idea, method, outcome, and projected impact -- which correspond to five key steps in the research workflow. These structured summaries facilitate a variety of downstream tasks and analyses. The quality of the LLM-extracted summaries is validated by comparing them with human annotations. We demonstrate the utility of MASSW through multiple novel machine-learning tasks that can be benchmarked using this new dataset, which make various types of predictions and recommendations along the scientific workflow. MASSW holds significant potential for researchers to create and benchmark new AI methods for optimizing scientific workflows and fostering scientific innovation in the field. Our dataset is openly available at \url{https://github.com/xingjian-zhang/massw}.</description>

      <title>Automating Food Drop: The Power of Two Choices for Dynamic and Fair Food Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Food waste and food insecurity are two closely related pressing global issues. Food rescue organizations worldwide run programs aimed at addressing the two problems. In this paper, we partner with a non-profit organization in the state of Indiana that leads \emph{Food Drop}, a program that is designed to redirect rejected truckloads of food away from landfills and into food banks. The truckload to food bank matching decisions are currently made by an employee of our partner organization. In addition to this being a very time-consuming task, as perhaps expected from human-based matching decisions, the allocations are often skewed: a small percentage of the possible recipients receives the majority of donations. Our goal in this partnership is to completely automate Food Drop. In doing so, we need a matching algorithm for making real-time decisions that strikes a balance between ensuring fairness for the food banks that receive the food and optimizing efficiency for the truck drivers. In this paper, we describe the theoretical guarantees and experiments that dictated our choice of algorithm in the platform we built and deployed for our partner organization. Our work also makes contributions to the literature on load balancing and balls-into-bins games, that might be of independent interest. Specifically, we study the allocation of $m$ weighted balls into $n$ weighted bins, where each ball has two non-uniformly sampled random bin choices, and prove upper bounds, that hold with high probability, on the maximum load of any bin.</description>

      <title>Improving Deep Learning-based Automatic Cranial Defect Reconstruction by Heavy Data Augmentation: From Image Registration to Latent Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and manufacturing of personalized cranial implants are important research areas that may decrease the waiting time for patients suffering from cranial damage. The modeling of personalized implants may be partially automated by the use of deep learning-based methods. However, this task suffers from difficulties with generalizability into data from previously unseen distributions that make it difficult to use the research outcomes in real clinical settings. Due to difficulties with acquiring ground-truth annotations, different techniques to improve the heterogeneity of datasets used for training the deep networks have to be considered and introduced. In this work, we present a large-scale study of several augmentation techniques, varying from classical geometric transformations, image registration, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks, to the most recent advances in latent diffusion models. We show that the use of heavy data augmentation significantly increases both the quantitative and qualitative outcomes, resulting in an average Dice Score above 0.94 for the SkullBreak and above 0.96 for the SkullFix datasets. Moreover, we show that the synthetically augmented network successfully reconstructs real clinical defects. The work is a considerable contribution to the field of artificial intelligence in the automatic modeling of personalized cranial implants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cross-modal music processing, translation between visual, auditory, and semantic content opens up new possibilities as well as challenges. The construction of such a transformative scheme depends upon a benchmark corpus with a comprehensive data infrastructure. In particular, the assembly of a large-scale cross-modal dataset presents major challenges. In this paper, we present the MOSA (Music mOtion with Semantic Annotation) dataset, which contains high quality 3-D motion capture data, aligned audio recordings, and note-by-note semantic annotations of pitch, beat, phrase, dynamic, articulation, and harmony for 742 professional music performances by 23 professional musicians, comprising more than 30 hours and 570 K notes of data. To our knowledge, this is the largest cross-modal music dataset with note-level annotations to date. To demonstrate the usage of the MOSA dataset, we present several innovative cross-modal music information retrieval (MIR) and musical content generation tasks, including the detection of beats, downbeats, phrase, and expressive contents from audio, video and motion data, and the generation of musicians' body motion from given music audio. The dataset and codes are available alongside this publication (https://github.com/yufenhuang/MOSA-Music-mOtion-and-Semantic-Annotation-dataset).</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Quantization-Aware Training for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are omnipresent, however their practical deployment is challenging due to their ever increasing computational and memory demands. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to make them more compute and memory efficient. Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods, generally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost of potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it impractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a lightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several components to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a) low-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a downcasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c) checkpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient, leading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen as a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model can still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied across a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices quantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with many PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to the LLaMA-2/3 and Mistral model families and validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method outperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the same model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage. Specifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of memory.</description>

      <title>Contrastive learning of T cell receptor representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational prediction of the interaction of T cell receptors (TCRs) and their ligands is a grand challenge in immunology. Despite advances in high-throughput assays, specificity-labelled TCR data remains sparse. In other domains, the pre-training of language models on unlabelled data has been successfully used to address data bottlenecks. However, it is unclear how to best pre-train protein language models for TCR specificity prediction. Here we introduce a TCR language model called SCEPTR (Simple Contrastive Embedding of the Primary sequence of T cell Receptors), capable of data-efficient transfer learning. Through our model, we introduce a novel pre-training strategy combining autocontrastive learning and masked-language modelling, which enables SCEPTR to achieve its state-of-the-art performance. In contrast, existing protein language models and a variant of SCEPTR pre-trained without autocontrastive learning are outperformed by sequence alignment-based methods. We anticipate that contrastive learning will be a useful paradigm to decode the rules of TCR specificity.</description>

      <title>Should We Fine-Tune or RAG? Evaluating Different Techniques to Adapt LLMs for Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task of response generation in human-machine dialogue. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature for different dialogue types (e.g., Open-Domain). However, the evaluations of these techniques have been limited in terms of base LLMs, dialogue types and evaluation metrics. In this work, we extensively analyze different LLM adaptation techniques when applied to different dialogue types. We have selected two base LLMs, Llama-2 and Mistral, and four dialogue types Open-Domain, Knowledge-Grounded, Task-Oriented, and Question Answering. We evaluate the performance of in-context learning and fine-tuning techniques across datasets selected for each dialogue type. We assess the impact of incorporating external knowledge to ground the generation in both scenarios of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and gold knowledge. We adopt consistent evaluation and explainability criteria for automatic metrics and human evaluation protocols. Our analysis shows that there is no universal best-technique for adapting large language models as the efficacy of each technique depends on both the base LLM and the specific type of dialogue. Last but not least, the assessment of the best adaptation technique should include human evaluation to avoid false expectations and outcomes derived from automatic metrics.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Design Justice Approach to Identifying Ethical Considerations in the Intersection of Large Language Models and Social Robotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in social robotics presents a unique set of ethical challenges and social impacts. This research is set out to identify ethical considerations that arise in the design and development of these two technologies in combination. Using LLMs for social robotics may provide benefits, such as enabling natural language open-domain dialogues. However, the intersection of these two technologies also gives rise to ethical concerns related to misinformation, non-verbal cues, emotional disruption, and biases. The robot's physical social embodiment adds complexity, as ethical hazards associated with LLM-based Social AI, such as hallucinations and misinformation, can be exacerbated due to the effects of physical embodiment on social perception and communication. To address these challenges, this study employs an empirical design justice-based methodology, focusing on identifying socio-technical ethical considerations through a qualitative co-design and interaction study. The purpose of the study is to identify ethical considerations relevant to the process of co-design of, and interaction with a humanoid social robot as the interface of a LLM, and to evaluate how a design justice methodology can be used in the context of designing LLMs-based social robotics. The findings reveal a mapping of ethical considerations arising in four conceptual dimensions: interaction, co-design, terms of service and relationship and evaluates how a design justice approach can be used empirically in the intersection of LLMs and social robotics.</description>

      <title>Explainable Graph Neural Networks Under Fire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictions made by graph neural networks (GNNs) usually lack interpretability due to their complex computational behavior and the abstract nature of graphs. In an attempt to tackle this, many GNN explanation methods have emerged. Their goal is to explain a model's predictions and thereby obtain trust when GNN models are deployed in decision critical applications. Most GNN explanation methods work in a post-hoc manner and provide explanations in the form of a small subset of important edges and/or nodes. In this paper we demonstrate that these explanations can unfortunately not be trusted, as common GNN explanation methods turn out to be highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations. That is, even small perturbations of the original graph structure that preserve the model's predictions may yield drastically different explanations. This calls into question the trustworthiness and practical utility of post-hoc explanation methods for GNNs. To be able to attack GNN explanation models, we devise a novel attack method dubbed \textit{GXAttack}, the first \textit{optimization-based} adversarial attack method for post-hoc GNN explanations under such settings. Due to the devastating effectiveness of our attack, we call for an adversarial evaluation of future GNN explainers to demonstrate their robustness.</description>

      <title>DISCO: An End-to-End Bandit Framework for Personalised Discount Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalised discount codes provide a powerful mechanism for managing customer relationships and operational spend in e-commerce. Bandits are well suited for this product area, given the partial information nature of the problem, as well as the need for adaptation to the changing business environment. Here, we introduce DISCO, an end-to-end contextual bandit framework for personalised discount code allocation at ASOS.com. DISCO adapts the traditional Thompson Sampling algorithm by integrating it within an integer program, thereby allowing for operational cost control. Because bandit learning is often worse with high dimensional actions, we focused on building low dimensional action and context representations that were nonetheless capable of good accuracy. Additionally, we sought to build a model that preserved the relationship between price and sales, in which customers increasing their purchasing in response to lower prices ("negative price elasticity"). These aims were achieved by using radial basis functions to represent the continuous (i.e. infinite armed) action space, in combination with context embeddings extracted from a neural network. These feature representations were used within a Thompson Sampling framework to facilitate exploration, and further integrated with an integer program to allocate discount codes across ASOS's customer base. These modelling decisions result in a reward model that (a) enables pooled learning across similar actions, (b) is highly accurate, including in extrapolation, and (c) preserves the expected negative price elasticity. Through offline analysis, we show that DISCO is able to effectively enact exploration and improves its performance over time, despite the global constraint. Finally, we subjected DISCO to a rigorous online A/B test, and find that it achieves a significant improvement of &gt;1% in average basket value, relative to the legacy systems.</description>

      <title>Language Models are Alignable Decision-Makers: Dataset and Application to the Medical Triage Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In difficult decision-making scenarios, it is common to have conflicting opinions among expert human decision-makers as there may not be a single right answer. Such decisions may be guided by different attributes that can be used to characterize an individual's decision. We introduce a novel dataset for medical triage decision-making, labeled with a set of decision-maker attributes (DMAs). This dataset consists of 62 scenarios, covering six different DMAs, including ethical principles such as fairness and moral desert. We present a novel software framework for human-aligned decision-making by utilizing these DMAs, paving the way for trustworthy AI with better guardrails. Specifically, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can serve as ethical decision-makers, and how their decisions can be aligned to different DMAs using zero-shot prompting. Our experiments focus on different open-source models with varying sizes and training techniques, such as Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. Finally, we also introduce a new form of weighted self-consistency that improves the overall quantified performance. Our results provide new research directions in the use of LLMs as alignable decision-makers. The dataset and open-source software are publicly available at: https://github.com/ITM-Kitware/llm-alignable-dm.</description>

      <title>Interpretability of Language Models via Task Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The usual way to interpret language models (LMs) is to test their performance on different benchmarks and subsequently infer their internal processes. In this paper, we present an alternative approach, concentrating on the quality of LM processing, with a focus on their language abilities. To this end, we construct 'linguistic task spaces' -- representations of an LM's language conceptualisation -- that shed light on the connections LMs draw between language phenomena. Task spaces are based on the interactions of the learning signals from different linguistic phenomena, which we assess via a method we call 'similarity probing'. To disentangle the learning signals of linguistic phenomena, we further introduce a method called 'fine-tuning via gradient differentials' (FTGD). We apply our methods to language models of three different scales and find that larger models generalise better to overarching general concepts for linguistic tasks, making better use of their shared structure. Further, the distributedness of linguistic processing increases with pre-training through increased parameter sharing between related linguistic tasks. The overall generalisation patterns are mostly stable throughout training and not marked by incisive stages, potentially explaining the lack of successful curriculum strategies for LMs.</description>

      <title>Insights from Social Shaping Theory: The Appropriation of Large Language Models in an Undergraduate Programming Course</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate, debug, and explain code has sparked the interest of researchers and educators in undergraduate programming, with many anticipating their transformative potential in programming education. However, decisions about why and how to use LLMs in programming education may involve more than just the assessment of an LLM's technical capabilities. Using the social shaping of technology theory as a guiding framework, our study explores how students' social perceptions influence their own LLM usage. We then examine the correlation of self-reported LLM usage with students' self-efficacy and midterm performances in an undergraduate programming course. Triangulating data from an anonymous end-of-course student survey (n = 158), a mid-course self-efficacy survey (n=158), student interviews (n = 10), self-reported LLM usage on homework, and midterm performances, we discovered that students' use of LLMs was associated with their expectations for their future careers and their perceptions of peer usage. Additionally, early self-reported LLM usage in our context correlated with lower self-efficacy and lower midterm scores, while students' perceived over-reliance on LLMs, rather than their usage itself, correlated with decreased self-efficacy later in the course.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-World Efficiency: Domain Randomization in Reinforcement Learning for Pre-Capture of Free-Floating Moving Targets by Autonomous Robots</title>

Abstract: In this research, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning-based control approach to address the intricate challenge of the robotic pre-grasping phase under microgravity conditions. Leveraging reinforcement learning eliminates the necessity for manual feature design, therefore simplifying the problem and empowering the robot to learn pre-grasping policies through trial and error. Our methodology incorporates an off-policy reinforcement learning framework, employing the soft actor-critic technique to enable the gripper to proficiently approach a free-floating moving object, ensuring optimal pre-grasp success. For effective learning of the pre-grasping approach task, we developed a reward function that offers the agent clear and insightful feedback. Our case study examines a pre-grasping task where a Robotiq 3F gripper is required to navigate towards a free-floating moving target, pursue it, and subsequently position itself at the desired pre-grasp location. We assessed our approach through a series of experiments in both simulated and real-world environments. The source code, along with recordings of real-world robot grasping, is available at Fanuc_Robotiq_Grasp.</description>

      <title>AID: Adapting Image2Video Diffusion Models for Instruction-guided Video Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-guided video prediction (TVP) involves predicting the motion of future frames from the initial frame according to an instruction, which has wide applications in virtual reality, robotics, and content creation. Previous TVP methods make significant breakthroughs by adapting Stable Diffusion for this task. However, they struggle with frame consistency and temporal stability primarily due to the limited scale of video datasets. We observe that pretrained Image2Video diffusion models possess good priors for video dynamics but they lack textual control. Hence, transferring Image2Video models to leverage their video dynamic priors while injecting instruction control to generate controllable videos is both a meaningful and challenging task. To achieve this, we introduce the Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to predict future video states based on initial frames and text instructions. More specifically, we design a dual query transformer (DQFormer) architecture, which integrates the instructions and frames into the conditional embeddings for future frame prediction. Additionally, we develop Long-Short Term Temporal Adapters and Spatial Adapters that can quickly transfer general video diffusion models to specific scenarios with minimal training costs. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four datasets: Something Something V2, Epic Kitchen-100, Bridge Data, and UCF-101. Notably, AID achieves 91.2% and 55.5% FVD improvements on Bridge and SSv2 respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains.

      <title>How Far Can Transformers Reason? The Locality Barrier and Inductive Scratchpad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can Transformers predict new syllogisms by composing established ones? More generally, what type of targets can be learned by such models from scratch? Recent works show that Transformers can be Turing-complete in terms of expressivity, but this does not address the learnability objective. This paper puts forward the notion of 'distribution locality' to capture when weak learning is efficiently achievable by regular Transformers, where the locality measures the least number of tokens required in addition to the tokens histogram to correlate nontrivially with the target. As shown experimentally and theoretically under additional assumptions, distributions with high locality cannot be learned efficiently. In particular, syllogisms cannot be composed on long chains. Furthermore, we show that (i) an agnostic scratchpad cannot help to break the locality barrier, (ii) an educated scratchpad can help if it breaks the locality at each step, (iii) a notion of 'inductive scratchpad' can both break the locality and improve the out-of-distribution generalization, e.g., generalizing to almost double input size for some arithmetic tasks.</description>

      <title>GKAN: Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (GKAN), an innovative neural network architecture that extends the principles of the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to graph-structured data. By adopting the unique characteristics of KANs, notably the use of learnable univariate functions instead of fixed linear weights, we develop a powerful model for graph-based learning tasks. Unlike traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that rely on a fixed convolutional architecture, GKANs implement learnable spline-based functions between layers, transforming the way information is processed across the graph structure. We present two different ways to incorporate KAN layers into GKAN: architecture 1 -- where the learnable functions are applied to input features after aggregation and architecture 2 -- where the learnable functions are applied to input features before aggregation. We evaluate GKAN empirically using a semi-supervised graph learning task on a real-world dataset (Cora). We find that architecture generally performs better. We find that GKANs achieve higher accuracy in semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs compared to the traditional GCN model. For example, when considering 100 features, GCN provides an accuracy of 53.5 while a GKAN with a comparable number of parameters gives an accuracy of 61.76; with 200 features, GCN provides an accuracy of 61.24 while a GKAN with a comparable number of parameters gives an accuracy of 67.66. We also present results on the impact of various parameters such as the number of hidden nodes, grid-size, and the polynomial-degree of the spline on the performance of GKAN.</description>

      <title>Survey for Landing Generative AI in Social and E-commerce Recsys -- the Industry Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, generative AI (GAI), with their emerging capabilities, have presented unique opportunities for augmenting and revolutionizing industrial recommender systems (Recsys). Despite growing research efforts at the intersection of these fields, the integration of GAI into industrial Recsys remains in its infancy, largely due to the intricate nature of modern industrial Recsys infrastructure, operations, and product sophistication. Drawing upon our experiences in successfully integrating GAI into several major social and e-commerce platforms, this survey aims to comprehensively examine the underlying system and AI foundations, solution frameworks, connections to key research advancements, as well as summarize the practical insights and challenges encountered in the endeavor to integrate GAI into industrial Recsys. As pioneering work in this domain, we hope outline the representative developments of relevant fields, shed lights on practical GAI adoptions in the industry, and motivate future research.</description>

      <title>High-precision surgical navigation using speckle structured light-based thoracoabdominal puncture robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract
  Background During percutaneous puncture robotic surgical navigation, the needle insertion point is positioned on the patient's chest and abdomen body surface. By locating any point on the soft skin tissue, it is difficult to apply the traditional reflective ball tracking method. The patient's chest and abdomen body surface has fluctuations in breathing and appears irregular. The chest and abdomen are regular and smooth, lacking obvious features, and it is challenging to locate the needle insertion point on the body surface. Methods This paper designs and experiments a method that is different from previous reflective ball optical markers or magnetic positioning surgical navigation and tracking methods. It is based on a speckle structured light camera to identify the patient's body surface and fit it into a hollow ring with a diameter of 24mm. Results Experimental results show that this method of the system can be small, flexible, and high-precision positioning of any body surface point at multiple angles, achieving a positioning accuracy of 0.033-0.563mm and an image of 7-30 frames/s. Conclusions The positioning recognition ring material used in this method can be well imaged under CT, so the optical positioning of the body surface and the in vivo imaging positioning under CT can be combined to form a unified patient's internal and external positioning world coordinates to achieve internal and external registration. Positioning integration. The system senses motion with six degrees of freedom, up and down, front and back, left and right, and all rotations, with sub-millimeter accuracy, and has broad application prospects in future puncture surgeries.</description>

      <title>Can Language Models Serve as Text-Based World Simulators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual environments play a key role in benchmarking advances in complex planning and decision-making tasks but are expensive and complicated to build by hand. Can current language models themselves serve as world simulators, correctly predicting how actions change different world states, thus bypassing the need for extensive manual coding? Our goal is to answer this question in the context of text-based simulators. Our approach is to build and use a new benchmark, called ByteSized32-State-Prediction, containing a dataset of text game state transitions and accompanying game tasks. We use this to directly quantify, for the first time, how well LLMs can serve as text-based world simulators. We test GPT-4 on this dataset and find that, despite its impressive performance, it is still an unreliable world simulator without further innovations. This work thus contributes both new insights into current LLM's capabilities and weaknesses, as well as a novel benchmark to track future progress as new models appear.</description>

      <title>Scaling Continuous Latent Variable Models as Probabilistic Integral Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic integral circuits (PICs) have been recently introduced as probabilistic models enjoying the key ingredient behind expressive generative models: continuous latent variables (LVs). PICs are symbolic computational graphs defining continuous LV models as hierarchies of functions that are summed and multiplied together, or integrated over some LVs. They are tractable if LVs can be analytically integrated out, otherwise they can be approximated by tractable probabilistic circuits (PC) encoding a hierarchical numerical quadrature process, called QPCs.
  So far, only tree-shaped PICs have been explored, and training them via numerical quadrature requires memory-intensive processing at scale. In this paper, we address these issues, and present: (i) a pipeline for building DAG-shaped PICs out of arbitrary variable decompositions, (ii) a procedure for training PICs using tensorized circuit architectures, and (iii) neural functional sharing techniques to allow scalable training. In extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of functional sharing and the superiority of QPCs over traditional PCs.</description>

      <title>Monkey See, Monkey Do: Harnessing Self-attention in Motion Diffusion for Zero-shot Motion Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the remarkable results of motion synthesis with diffusion models, a natural question arises: how can we effectively leverage these models for motion editing? Existing diffusion-based motion editing methods overlook the profound potential of the prior embedded within the weights of pre-trained models, which enables manipulating the latent feature space; hence, they primarily center on handling the motion space. In this work, we explore the attention mechanism of pre-trained motion diffusion models. We uncover the roles and interactions of attention elements in capturing and representing intricate human motion patterns, and carefully integrate these elements to transfer a leader motion to a follower one while maintaining the nuanced characteristics of the follower, resulting in zero-shot motion transfer. Editing features associated with selected motions allows us to confront a challenge observed in prior motion diffusion approaches, which use general directives (e.g., text, music) for editing, ultimately failing to convey subtle nuances effectively. Our work is inspired by how a monkey closely imitates what it sees while maintaining its unique motion patterns; hence we call it Monkey See, Monkey Do, and dub it MoMo. Employing our technique enables accomplishing tasks such as synthesizing out-of-distribution motions, style transfer, and spatial editing. Furthermore, diffusion inversion is seldom employed for motions; as a result, editing efforts focus on generated motions, limiting the editability of real ones. MoMo harnesses motion inversion, extending its application to both real and generated motions. Experimental results show the advantage of our approach over the current art. In particular, unlike methods tailored for specific applications through training, our approach is applied at inference time, requiring no training.

      <title>Merlin: A Vision Language Foundation Model for 3D Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over 85 million computed tomography (CT) scans are performed annually in the US, of which approximately one quarter focus on the abdomen. Given the current radiologist shortage, there is a large impetus to use artificial intelligence to alleviate the burden of interpreting these complex imaging studies. Prior state-of-the-art approaches for automated medical image interpretation leverage vision language models (VLMs). However, current medical VLMs are generally limited to 2D images and short reports, and do not leverage electronic health record (EHR) data for supervision. We introduce Merlin - a 3D VLM that we train using paired CT scans (6+ million images from 15,331 CTs), EHR diagnosis codes (1.8+ million codes), and radiology reports (6+ million tokens). We evaluate Merlin on 6 task types and 752 individual tasks. The non-adapted (off-the-shelf) tasks include zero-shot findings classification (31 findings), phenotype classification (692 phenotypes), and zero-shot cross-modal retrieval (image to findings and image to impressions), while model adapted tasks include 5-year disease prediction (6 diseases), radiology report generation, and 3D semantic segmentation (20 organs). We perform internal validation on a test set of 5,137 CTs, and external validation on 7,000 clinical CTs and on two public CT datasets (VerSe, TotalSegmentator). Beyond these clinically-relevant evaluations, we assess the efficacy of various network architectures and training strategies to depict that Merlin has favorable performance to existing task-specific baselines. We derive data scaling laws to empirically assess training data needs for requisite downstream task performance. Furthermore, unlike conventional VLMs that require hundreds of GPUs for training, we perform all training on a single GPU.</description>

Abstract: This work tackles the challenges of data heterogeneity and communication limitations in decentralized federated learning. We focus on creating a collaboration graph that guides each client in selecting suitable collaborators for training personalized models that leverage their local data effectively. Our approach addresses these issues through a novel, communication-efficient strategy that enhances resource efficiency. Unlike traditional methods, our formulation identifies collaborators at a granular level by considering combinatorial relations of clients, enhancing personalization while minimizing communication overhead. We achieve this through a bi-level optimization framework that employs a constrained greedy algorithm, resulting in a resource-efficient collaboration graph for personalized learning. Extensive evaluation against various baselines across diverse datasets demonstrates the superiority of our method, named DPFL. DPFL consistently outperforms other approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in handling real-world data heterogeneity, minimizing communication overhead, enhancing resource efficiency, and building personalized models in decentralized federated learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>IllumiNeRF: 3D Relighting without Inverse Rendering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for relightable view synthesis -- using a set of images of an object under unknown lighting to recover a 3D representation that can be rendered from novel viewpoints under a target illumination -- are based on inverse rendering, and attempt to disentangle the object geometry, materials, and lighting that explain the input images. Furthermore, this typically involves optimization through differentiable Monte Carlo rendering, which is brittle and computationally-expensive. In this work, we propose a simpler approach: we first relight each input image using an image diffusion model conditioned on lighting and then reconstruct a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) with these relit images, from which we render novel views under the target lighting. We demonstrate that this strategy is surprisingly competitive and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple relighting benchmarks.

Abstract: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a search paradigm that first found prominence with its success in the domain of computer Go. Early theoretical work established the soundness and convergence bounds for Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (UCT), the most popular instantiation of MCTS; however, there remain notable gaps in our understanding of how UCT behaves in practice. In this work, we address one such gap by considering the question of whether UCT can exhibit lookahead pathology in adversarial settings -- a paradoxical phenomenon first observed in Minimax search where greater search effort leads to worse decision-making. We introduce a novel family of synthetic games that offer rich modeling possibilities while remaining amenable to mathematical analysis. Our theoretical and experimental results suggest that UCT is indeed susceptible to pathological behavior in a range of games drawn from this family.</description>

      <title>The Structure and Dynamics of Knowledge Graphs, with Superficiality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large knowledge graphs combine human knowledge garnered from projects ranging from academia and institutions to enterprises and crowdsourcing. Within such graphs, each relationship between two nodes represents a basic fact involving these two entities. The diversity of the semantics of relationships constitutes the richness of knowledge graphs, leading to the emergence of singular topologies, sometimes chaotic in appearance. However, this complex characteristic can be modeled in a simple way by introducing the concept of superficiality, which controls the overlap between relationships whose facts are generated independently. With this model, superficiality also regulates the balance of the global distribution of knowledge by determining the proportion of misdescribed entities. This is the first model for the structure and dynamics of knowledge graphs. It leads to a better understanding of formal knowledge acquisition and organization.</description>

Abstract: In the investment industry, it is often essential to carry out fine-grained company similarity quantification for a range of purposes, including market mapping, competitor analysis, and mergers and acquisitions. We propose and publish a knowledge graph, named CompanyKG, to represent and learn diverse company features and relations. Specifically, 1.17 million companies are represented as nodes enriched with company description embeddings; and 15 different inter-company relations result in 51.06 million weighted edges. To enable a comprehensive assessment of methods for company similarity quantification, we have devised and compiled three evaluation tasks with annotated test sets: similarity prediction, competitor retrieval and similarity ranking. We present extensive benchmarking results for 11 reproducible predictive methods categorized into three groups: node-only, edge-only, and node+edge. To the best of our knowledge, CompanyKG is the first large-scale heterogeneous graph dataset originating from a real-world investment platform, tailored for quantifying inter-company similarity.</description>

      <title>Saliency strikes back: How filtering out high frequencies improves white-box explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09591v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attribution methods correspond to a class of explainability methods (XAI) that aim to assess how individual inputs contribute to a model's decision-making process. We have identified a significant limitation in one type of attribution methods, known as ``white-box" methods. Although highly efficient, as we will show, these methods rely on a gradient signal that is often contaminated by high-frequency artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new approach called "FORGrad". This simple method effectively filters out these high-frequency artifacts using optimal cut-off frequencies tailored to the unique characteristics of each model architecture. Our findings show that FORGrad consistently enhances the performance of already existing white-box methods, enabling them to compete effectively with more accurate yet computationally demanding "black-box" methods. We anticipate that our research will foster broader adoption of simpler and more efficient white-box methods for explainability, offering a better balance between faithfulness and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>ZSC-Eval: An Evaluation Toolkit and Benchmark for Multi-agent Zero-shot Coordination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) is a new cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) challenge that aims to train an ego agent to work with diverse, unseen partners during deployment. The significant difference between the deployment-time partners' distribution and the training partners' distribution determined by the training algorithm makes ZSC a unique out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization challenge. The potential distribution gap between evaluation and deployment-time partners leads to inadequate evaluation, which is exacerbated by the lack of appropriate evaluation metrics. In this paper, we present ZSC-Eval, the first evaluation toolkit and benchmark for ZSC algorithms. ZSC-Eval consists of: 1) Generation of evaluation partner candidates through behavior-preferring rewards to approximate deployment-time partners' distribution; 2) Selection of evaluation partners by Best-Response Diversity (BR-Div); 3) Measurement of generalization performance with various evaluation partners via the Best-Response Proximity (BR-Prox) metric. We use ZSC-Eval to benchmark ZSC algorithms in Overcooked and Google Research Football environments and get novel empirical findings. We also conduct a human experiment of current ZSC algorithms to verify the ZSC-Eval's consistency with human evaluation. ZSC-Eval is now available at https://github.com/sjtu-marl/ZSC-Eval.</description>

      <title>Online Speculative Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07177v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a pivotal technique to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a smaller draft model to predict the target model's outputs. However, its efficacy can be limited due to the low predictive accuracy of the draft model, particularly when faced with diverse text inputs and a significant capability gap between the draft and target models. We introduce online speculative decoding to address this challenge. The main idea is to continuously update the (multiple) draft model(s) on observed user query data. Adapting to query distribution mitigates the shifts between the training distribution of the draft model and the query distribution, enabling the draft model to more accurately predict the target model's outputs. We develop a prototype of online speculative decoding based on knowledge distillation and evaluate it using both synthetic and real query data. The results show a substantial increase in the token acceptance rate by 0.1 to 0.65, bringing 1.42x to 2.17x latency reduction.

Abstract: Accelerated development of demand response service provision by the residential sector is crucial for reducing carbon-emissions in the power sector. Along with the infrastructure advancement, encouraging the end users to participate is crucial. End users highly value their privacy and control, and want to be included in the service design and decision-making process when creating the daily appliance operation schedules. Furthermore, unless they are financially or environmentally motivated, they are generally not prepared to sacrifice their comfort to help balance the power system. In this paper, we present an inverse-reinforcement-learning-based model that helps create the end users' daily appliance schedules without asking them to explicitly state their needs and wishes. By using their past consumption data, the end consumers will implicitly participate in the creation of those decisions and will thus be motivated to continue participating in the provision of demand response services.</description>

      <title>Agent-Specific Effects: A Causal Effect Propagation Analysis in Multi-Agent MDPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Establishing causal relationships between actions and outcomes is fundamental for accountable multi-agent decision-making. However, interpreting and quantifying agents' contributions to such relationships pose significant challenges. These challenges are particularly prominent in the context of multi-agent sequential decision-making, where the causal effect of an agent's action on the outcome depends on how other agents respond to that action. In this paper, our objective is to present a systematic approach for attributing the causal effects of agents' actions to the influence they exert on other agents. Focusing on multi-agent Markov decision processes, we introduce agent-specific effects (ASE), a novel causal quantity that measures the effect of an agent's action on the outcome that propagates through other agents. We then turn to the counterfactual counterpart of ASE (cf-ASE), provide a sufficient set of conditions for identifying cf-ASE, and propose a practical sampling-based algorithm for estimating it. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the utility of cf-ASE through a simulation-based testbed, which includes a sepsis management environment.</description>

      <title>A Definition of Open-Ended Learning Problems for Goal-Conditioned Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00344v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A lot of recent machine learning research papers have ``open-ended learning'' in their title. But very few of them attempt to define what they mean when using the term. Even worse, when looking more closely there seems to be no consensus on what distinguishes open-ended learning from related concepts such as continual learning, lifelong learning or autotelic learning. In this paper, we contribute to fixing this situation. After illustrating the genealogy of the concept and more recent perspectives about what it truly means, we outline that open-ended learning is generally conceived as a composite notion encompassing a set of diverse properties. In contrast with previous approaches, we propose to isolate a key elementary property of open-ended processes, which is to produce elements from time to time (e.g., observations, options, reward functions, and goals), over an infinite horizon, that are considered novel from an observer's perspective. From there, we build the notion of open-ended learning problems and focus in particular on the subset of open-ended goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problems in which agents can learn a growing repertoire of goal-driven skills. Finally, we highlight the work that remains to be performed to fill the gap between our elementary definition and the more involved notions of open-ended learning that developmental AI researchers may have in mind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08189v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt engineering is critical for the development of LLM-based applications. However, it is usually done manually in a "trial and error" fashion that can be time consuming, ineffective, and sub-optimal. Even for the prompts which seemingly work well, there is always a lingering question: can the prompts be made better with further modifications?
  To address these problems, we investigate automated prompt engineering in this paper. Specifically, we propose PRewrite, an automated method to rewrite an under-optimized prompt to a more effective prompt. We instantiate the prompt rewriter using a LLM. The rewriter LLM is trained using reinforcement learning to optimize the performance on a given downstream task. We conduct experiments on diverse benchmark datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of PRewrite.</description>

      <title>DeLLMa: A Framework for Decision Making Under Uncertainty with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) as decision support tools is increasingly being explored in fields such as business, engineering, and medicine, which often face challenging tasks of decision-making under uncertainty. In this paper, we show that directly prompting LLMs on these types of decision-making problems can yield poor results, especially as the problem complexity increases. To aid in these tasks, we propose DeLLMa (Decision-making Large Language Model assistant), a framework designed to enhance decision-making accuracy in uncertain environments. DeLLMa involves a multi-step scaffolding procedure, drawing upon principles from decision theory and utility theory, to provide a rational and human-auditable decision-making process. We validate our framework on multiple realistic decision-making environments, demonstrating that DeLLMa can consistently enhance the decision-making performance of leading language models, and achieve up to a 40% increase in accuracy over competing methods.</description>

      <title>Offline Training of Language Model Agents with Functions as Learnable Weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers and practitioners have recently reframed powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents, enabling them to automate complex tasks largely via the use of specialized functions. To facilitate the development of LLM agents, we present a novel paradigm of training LLM agents without modifying the LLM weights, which is particularly useful when the LLMs are difficult or inaccessible for modifications. Inspired by how humans continuously forge tools to adapt to real-world tasks, rather than change our biological structure to fit a static set of tools, we propose to progressively forge agent's functions to better solve the downstream tasks instead of modifying the LLM weights. By treating the functions as learnable `agent parameters' and leveraging the fundamental idea of model training in artificial intelligence, we develop AgentOptimizer that employs the LLM to update agents' functions and devise an agent training algorithm with two strategies, roll-back, and early-stop, to streamline the training process. With extensive experiments, we showcase that the agent training paradigm could significantly improve the performance of representative LLM agents in various downstream tasks. We also study the behavior of the agent training regarding aspects like the learning curve and domain transferability.</description>

      <title>LLM as Prompter: Low-resource Inductive Reasoning on Arbitrary Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) inductive reasoning, which aims to infer missing facts from new KGs that are not seen during training, has been widely adopted in various applications. One critical challenge of KG inductive reasoning is handling low-resource scenarios with scarcity in both textual and structural aspects. In this paper, we attempt to address this challenge with Large Language Models (LLMs). Particularly, we utilize the state-of-the-art LLMs to generate a graph-structural prompt to enhance the pre-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which brings us new methodological insights into the KG inductive reasoning methods, as well as high generalizability in practice. On the methodological side, we introduce a novel pretraining and prompting framework ProLINK, designed for low-resource inductive reasoning across arbitrary KGs without requiring additional training. On the practical side, we experimentally evaluate our approach on 36 low-resource KG datasets and find that ProLINK outperforms previous methods in three-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot reasoning tasks, exhibiting average performance improvements by 20%, 45%, and 147%, respectively. Furthermore, ProLINK demonstrates strong robustness for various LLM promptings as well as full-shot scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically large language models like ChatGPT, has swiftly entered organizations without adequate governance, posing both opportunities and risks. Despite extensive debates on GenAI's transformative nature and regulatory measures, limited research addresses organizational governance, encompassing technical and business perspectives. Our review paper fills this gap by surveying recent works with the purpose of developing a framework for GenAI governance within companies. This framework outlines the scope, objectives, and governance mechanisms tailored to harness business opportunities as well as mitigate risks associated with GenAI integration. Our research contributes a focused approach to GenAI governance, offering practical insights for companies navigating the challenges of GenAI adoption and highlighting research gaps.</description>

      <title>TrustSQL: Benchmarking Text-to-SQL Reliability with Penalty-Based Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables users to interact with databases using natural language, simplifying the retrieval and synthesis of information. Despite the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) in translating natural language questions into SQL queries, widespread deployment remains limited due to two primary challenges. First, the effective use of text-to-SQL models depends on users' understanding of the model's capabilities-the scope of questions the model can correctly answer. Second, the absence of abstention mechanisms can lead to incorrect SQL generation going unnoticed, thereby undermining trust in the model's output. To enable wider deployment, it is crucial to address these challenges in model design and enhance model evaluation to build trust in the model's output. To this end, we introduce TrustSQL, a novel comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate text-to-SQL reliability-defined as a model's ability to correctly handle any type of input question by generating correct SQL queries for feasible questions and abstaining from generating infeasible ones (e.g., due to schema incompatibility or functionalities beyond SQL). We evaluate existing methods using a novel penalty-based scoring metric with two modeling approaches: (1) pipeline-based methods combining SQL generators with infeasible question detectors and SQL error detectors for abstention; and (2) unified methods using a single model for the entire task. Our experimental results reveal that achieving high scores under severe penalties requires significant effort and provide a new perspective on developing text-to-SQL models for safer deployment.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Efficacy of Prompt-Engineered Large Multimodal Models Versus Fine-Tuned Vision Transformers in Image-Based Security Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a parallel rise in the development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which have begun to transform a variety of applications. These sophisticated multimodal models are designed to interpret and analyze complex data by integrating multiple modalities such as text and images, thereby opening new avenues for a range of applications. This paper investigates the applicability and effectiveness of prompt-engineered LMMs that process both images and text, including models such as LLaVA, BakLLaVA, Moondream, Gemini-pro-vision, and GPT-4o, compared to fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) models in addressing critical security challenges. We focus on two distinct security tasks: 1) a visually evident task of detecting simple triggers, such as small pixel variations in images that could be exploited to access potential backdoors in the models, and 2) a visually non-evident task of malware classification through visual representations. In the visually evident task, some LMMs, such as Gemini-pro-vision and GPT-4o, have demonstrated the potential to achieve good performance with careful prompt engineering, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy and F1-score of 91.9\% and 91\%, respectively. However, the fine-tuned ViT models exhibit perfect performance in this task due to its simplicity. For the visually non-evident task, the results highlight a significant divergence in performance, with ViT models achieving F1-scores of 97.11\% in predicting 25 malware classes and 97.61\% in predicting 5 malware families, whereas LMMs showed suboptimal performance despite iterative prompt improvements. This study not only showcases the strengths and limitations of prompt-engineered LMMs in cybersecurity applications but also emphasizes the unmatched efficacy of fine-tuned ViT models for precise and dependable tasks.</description>

      <title>ITCMA: A Generative Agent Based on a Computational Consciousness Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges in tasks requiring understanding implicit instructions and applying common-sense knowledge. In such scenarios, LLMs may require multiple attempts to achieve human-level performance, potentially leading to inaccurate responses or inferences in practical environments, affecting their long-term consistency and behavior. This paper introduces the Internal Time-Consciousness Machine (ITCM), a computational consciousness structure to simulate the process of human consciousness. We further propose the ITCM-based Agent (ITCMA), which supports action generation and reasoning in open-world settings, and can independently complete tasks. ITCMA enhances LLMs' ability to understand implicit instructions and apply common-sense knowledge by considering agents' interaction and reasoning with the environment. Evaluations in the Alfworld environment show that trained ITCMA outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 9% on the seen set. Even untrained ITCMA achieves a 96% task completion rate on the seen set, 5% higher than SOTA, indicating its superiority over traditional intelligent agents in utility and generalization. In real-world tasks with quadruped robots, the untrained ITCMA achieves an 85% task completion rate, which is close to its performance in the unseen set, demonstrating its comparable utility and universality in real-world settings.</description>

Abstract: As the manufacturing industry advances with sensor integration and automation, the opaque nature of deep learning models in machine learning poses a significant challenge for fault detection and diagnosis. And despite the related predictive insights Artificial Intelligence (AI) can deliver, advanced machine learning engines often remain a black box. This paper reviews the eXplainable AI (XAI) tools and techniques in this context. We explore various XAI methodologies, focusing on their role in making AI decision-making transparent, particularly in critical scenarios where humans are involved. We also discuss current limitations and potential future research that aims to balance explainability with model performance while improving trustworthiness in the context of AI applications for critical industrial use cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous agents that execute human tasks by controlling computers can enhance human productivity and application accessibility. However, progress in this field will be driven by realistic and reproducible benchmarks. We present AndroidWorld, a fully functional Android environment that provides reward signals for 116 programmatic tasks across 20 real-world Android apps. Unlike existing interactive environments, which provide a static test set, AndroidWorld dynamically constructs tasks that are parameterized and expressed in natural language in unlimited ways, thus enabling testing on a much larger and more realistic suite of tasks. Reward signals are derived from the computer's system state, making them durable across task variations and extensible across different apps. To demonstrate AndroidWorld's benefits and mode of operation, we introduce a new computer control agent, M3A. M3A can complete 30.6% of the AndroidWorld's tasks, leaving ample room for future work. Furthermore, we adapt a popular desktop web agent to work on Android, which we find to be less effective on mobile, suggesting future research is needed to achieve universal, cross-domain agents. Finally, we conduct a robustness analysis by testing M3A against a range of task variations on a representative subset of tasks, demonstrating that variations in task parameters can significantly alter a task's complexity and, consequently, an agent's performance, highlighting the importance of testing agents under diverse conditions. AndroidWorld and the experiments in this paper are available at https://github.com/google-research/android_world.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SynthAI, a new method for the automated creation of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) designs. SynthAI integrates ReAct agents, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, web search technologies, and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework within a structured decision graph. This innovative approach enables the systematic decomposition of complex hardware design tasks into multiple stages and smaller, manageable modules. As a result, SynthAI produces synthesizable designs that closely adhere to user-specified design objectives and functional requirements. We further validate the capabilities of SynthAI through several case studies, highlighting its proficiency in generating complex, multi-module logic designs from a single initial prompt. The SynthAI code is provided via the following repo: \url{https://github.com/sarashs/FPGA_AGI}</description>

Abstract: World's healthcare systems and mental health agencies face both a growing demand for youth mental health services, alongside a simultaneous challenge of limited resources. Given these constraints, this work presents our experience in the creation and evaluation of the FAIIR (Frontline Assistant: Issue Identification and Recommendation) tool, an ensemble of domain-adapted and fine-tuned transformer models, leveraging natural language processing to identify issues that youth may be experiencing. We explore the technical development, performance, and validation processes leveraged for the FAIIR tool in application to situations of frontline crisis response via Kids Help Phone. Frontline Crisis Responders assign an issue tag from a defined list following each conversation. Assisting with the identification of issues of relevance helps reduce the burden on CRs, ensuring that appropriate resources can be provided and that active rescues and mandatory reporting can take place in critical situations requiring immediate de-escalation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the recent advancement in large language models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in combining LLMs with multimodal learning. Previous surveys of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mainly focus on multimodal understanding. This survey elaborates on multimodal generation and editing across various domains, comprising image, video, 3D, and audio. Specifically, we summarize the notable advancements with milestone works in these fields and categorize these studies into LLM-based and CLIP/T5-based methods. Then, we summarize the various roles of LLMs in multimodal generation and exhaustively investigate the critical technical components behind these methods and the multimodal datasets utilized in these studies. Additionally, we dig into tool-augmented multimodal agents that can leverage existing generative models for human-computer interaction. Lastly, we discuss the advancements in the generative AI safety field, investigate emerging applications, and discuss future prospects. Our work provides a systematic and insightful overview of multimodal generation and processing, which is expected to advance the development of Artificial Intelligence for Generative Content (AIGC) and world models.

      <title>Simplification of Risk Averse POMDPs with Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Risk averse decision making under uncertainty in partially observable domains is a fundamental problem in AI and essential for reliable autonomous agents. In our case, the problem is modeled using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), when the value function is the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of the return. Calculating an optimal solution for POMDPs is computationally intractable in general. In this work we develop a simplification framework to speedup the evaluation of the value function, while providing performance guarantees. We consider as simplification a computationally cheaper belief-MDP transition model, that can correspond, e.g., to cheaper observation or transition models. Our contributions include general bounds for CVaR that allow bounding the CVaR of a random variable X, using a random variable Y, by assuming bounds between their cumulative distributions. We then derive bounds for the CVaR value function in a POMDP setting, and show how to bound the value function using the computationally cheaper belief-MDP transition model and without accessing the computationally expensive model in real-time. Then, we provide theoretical performance guarantees for the estimated bounds. Our results apply for a general simplification of a belief-MDP transition model and support simplification of both the observation and state transition models simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for spectral sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new quantum algorithms for estimating spectral sums of positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices. The spectral sum of an PSD matrix $A$, for a function $f$, is defined as $ \text{Tr}[f(A)] = \sum_j f(\lambda_j)$, where $\lambda_j$ are the eigenvalues of $A$. Typical examples of spectral sums are the von Neumann entropy, the trace of $A^{-1}$, the log-determinant, and the Schatten $p$-norm, where the latter does not require the matrix to be PSD. The current best classical randomized algorithms estimating these quantities have a runtime that is at least linearly in the number of nonzero entries of the matrix and quadratic in the estimation error. Assuming access to a block-encoding of a matrix, our algorithms are sub-linear in the matrix size, and depend at most quadratically on other parameters, like the condition number and the approximation error, and thus can compete with most of the randomized and distributed classical algorithms proposed in the literature, and polynomially improve the runtime of other quantum algorithms proposed for the same problems. We show how the algorithms and techniques used in this work can be applied to three problems in spectral graph theory: approximating the number of triangles, the effective resistance, and the number of spanning trees within a graph.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Instance-Centric Counterfactual Algorithms for XAI: From White Box to Black Bo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of machine learning models on the generation of counterfactual explanations by conducting a benchmark evaluation over three different types of models: a decision tree (fully transparent, interpretable, white-box model), a random forest (semi-interpretable, grey-box model), and a neural network (fully opaque, black-box model). We tested the counterfactual generation process using four algorithms (DiCE, WatcherCF, prototype, and GrowingSpheresCF) in the literature in 25 different datasets. Our findings indicate that: (1) Different machine learning models have little impact on the generation of counterfactual explanations; (2) Counterfactual algorithms based uniquely on proximity loss functions are not actionable and will not provide meaningful explanations; (3) One cannot have meaningful evaluation results without guaranteeing plausibility in the counterfactual generation. Algorithms that do not consider plausibility in their internal mechanisms will lead to biased and unreliable conclusions if evaluated with the current state-of-the-art metrics; (4) A counterfactual inspection analysis is strongly recommended to ensure a robust examination of counterfactual explanations and the potential identification of biases.</description>

      <title>Minimum Variance Unbiased N:M Sparsity for the Neural Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In deep learning, fine-grained N:M sparsity reduces the data footprint and bandwidth of a General Matrix multiply (GEMM) up to x2, and doubles throughput by skipping computation of zero values. So far, it was mainly only used to prune weights to accelerate the forward and backward phases. We examine how this method can be used also for the neural gradients (i.e., loss gradients with respect to the intermediate neural layer outputs). To this end, we first establish a tensor-level optimality criteria. Previous works aimed to minimize the mean-square-error (MSE) of each pruned block. We show that while minimization of the MSE works fine for pruning the weights and activations, it catastrophically fails for the neural gradients. Instead, we show that accurate pruning of the neural gradients requires an unbiased minimum-variance pruning mask. We design such specialized masks, and find that in most cases, 1:2 sparsity is sufficient for training, and 2:4 sparsity is usually enough when this is not the case. Further, we suggest combining several such methods together in order to potentially speed up training even more.</description>

      <title>CDKT-FL: Cross-Device Knowledge Transfer using Proxy Dataset in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a practical setting, how to enable robust Federated Learning (FL) systems, both in terms of generalization and personalization abilities, is one important research question. It is a challenging issue due to the consequences of non-i.i.d. properties of client's data, often referred to as statistical heterogeneity, and small local data samples from the various data distributions. Therefore, to develop robust generalized global and personalized models, conventional FL methods need to redesign the knowledge aggregation from biased local models while considering huge divergence of learning parameters due to skewed client data. In this work, we demonstrate that the knowledge transfer mechanism achieves these objectives and develop a novel knowledge distillation-based approach to study the extent of knowledge transfer between the global model and local models. Henceforth, our method considers the suitability of transferring the outcome distribution and (or) the embedding vector of representation from trained models during cross-device knowledge transfer using a small proxy dataset in heterogeneous FL. In doing so, we alternatively perform cross-device knowledge transfer following general formulations as 1) global knowledge transfer and 2) on-device knowledge transfer. Through simulations on three federated datasets, we show the proposed method achieves significant speedups and high personalized performance of local models. Furthermore, the proposed approach offers a more stable algorithm than other baselines during the training, with minimal communication data load when exchanging the trained model's outcomes and representation.</description>

      <title>Mitigating spectral bias for the multiscale operator learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful tool for learning the mapping between infinite-dimensional parameter and solution spaces of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we focus on multiscale PDEs that have important applications such as reservoir modeling and turbulence prediction. We demonstrate that for such PDEs, the spectral bias towards low-frequency components presents a significant challenge for existing neural operators. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical attention neural operator (HANO) inspired by the hierarchical matrix approach. HANO features a scale-adaptive interaction range and self-attentions over a hierarchy of levels, enabling nested feature computation with controllable linear cost and encoding/decoding of multiscale solution space. We also incorporate an empirical $H^1$ loss function to enhance the learning of high-frequency components. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that HANO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for representative multiscale problems.</description>

      <title>An interpretable imbalanced semi-supervised deep learning framework for improving differential diagnosis of skin diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dermatological diseases are among the most common disorders worldwide. This paper presents the first study of the interpretability and imbalanced semi-supervised learning of the multiclass intelligent skin diagnosis framework (ISDL) using 58,457 skin images with 10,857 unlabeled samples. Pseudo-labelled samples from minority classes have a higher probability at each iteration of class-rebalancing self-training, thereby promoting the utilization of unlabeled samples to solve the class imbalance problem. Our ISDL achieved a promising performance with an accuracy of 0.979, sensitivity of 0.975, specificity of 0.973, macro-F1 score of 0.974 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.999 for multi-label skin disease classification. The Shapley Additive explanation (SHAP) method is combined with our ISDL to explain how the deep learning model makes predictions. This finding is consistent with the clinical diagnosis. We also proposed a sampling distribution optimisation strategy to select pseudo-labelled samples in a more effective manner using ISDLplus. Furthermore, it has the potential to relieve the pressure placed on professional doctors, as well as help with practical issues associated with a shortage of such doctors in rural areas.</description>

      <title>Visual-tactile Fusion for Transparent Object Grasping in Complex Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate detection and grasping of transparent objects are challenging but of significance to robots. Here, a visual-tactile fusion framework for transparent object grasping under complex backgrounds and variant light conditions is proposed, including the grasping position detection, tactile calibration, and visual-tactile fusion based classification. First, a multi-scene synthetic grasping dataset generation method with a Gaussian distribution based data annotation is proposed. Besides, a novel grasping network named TGCNN is proposed for grasping position detection, showing good results in both synthetic and real scenes. In tactile calibration, inspired by human grasping, a fully convolutional network based tactile feature extraction method and a central location based adaptive grasping strategy are designed, improving the success rate by 36.7% compared to direct grasping. Furthermore, a visual-tactile fusion method is proposed for transparent objects classification, which improves the classification accuracy by 34%. The proposed framework synergizes the advantages of vision and touch, and greatly improves the grasping efficiency of transparent objects.</description>

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into mobile applications has significantly transformed various domains, enhancing user experiences and providing personalized services through advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies. AI-driven mobile apps typically refer to applications that leverage ML/DL technologies to perform key tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing. In this paper, we conducted the most extensive empirical study on AI applications, exploring on-device ML apps, on-device DL apps, and AI service-supported (cloud-based) apps. Our study encompasses 56,682 real-world AI applications, focusing on three crucial perspectives: 1) Application analysis, where we analyze the popularity of AI apps and investigate the update states of AI apps; 2) Framework and model analysis, where we analyze AI framework usage and AI model protection; 3) User analysis, where we examine user privacy protection and user review attitudes. Our study has strong implications for AI app developers, users, and AI R\&amp;D. On one hand, our findings highlight the growing trend of AI integration in mobile applications, demonstrating the widespread adoption of various AI frameworks and models. On the other hand, our findings emphasize the need for robust model protection to enhance app security. Additionally, our study highlights the importance of user privacy and presents user attitudes towards the AI technologies utilized in current AI apps. We provide our AI app dataset (currently the most extensive AI app dataset) as an open-source resource for future research on AI technologies utilized in mobile applications.</description>

      <title>Detecting Severity of Diabetic Retinopathy from Fundus Images: A Transformer Network-based Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is considered one of the significant concerns worldwide, primarily due to its impact on causing vision loss among most people with diabetes. The severity of DR is typically comprehended manually by ophthalmologists from fundus photography-based retina images. This paper deals with an automated understanding of the severity stages of DR. In the literature, researchers have focused on this automation using traditional machine learning-based algorithms and convolutional architectures. However, the past works hardly focused on essential parts of the retinal image to improve the model performance. In this study, we adopt and fine-tune transformer-based learning models to capture the crucial features of retinal images for a more nuanced understanding of DR severity. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness of image transformers to infer the degree of DR severity from fundus photographs. For experiments, we utilized the publicly available APTOS-2019 blindness detection dataset, where the performances of the transformer-based models were quite encouraging.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new high-performance activation function, Moderate Adaptive Linear Units (MoLU), for the deep neural network. The MoLU is a simple, beautiful and powerful activation function that can be a good main activation function among hundreds of activation functions. Because the MoLU is made up of the elementary functions, not only it is a infinite diffeomorphism (i.e. smooth and infinitely differentiable over whole domains), but also it decreases training time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning is an emerging paradigm for selectively removing the impact of training datapoints from a network. Unlike existing methods that target a limited subset or a single class, our framework unlearns all classes in a single round. We achieve this by modulating the network's components using memory matrices, enabling the network to demonstrate selective unlearning behavior for any class after training. By discovering weights that are specific to each class, our approach also recovers a representation of the classes which is explainable by design. We test the proposed framework on small- and medium-scale image classification datasets, with both convolution- and Transformer-based backbones, showcasing the potential for explainable solutions through unlearning.</description>

      <title>Fusing Structure from Motion and Simulation-Augmented Pose Regression from Optical Flow for Challenging Indoor Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07250v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The localization of objects is a crucial task in various applications such as robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and the transportation of goods in warehouses. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the localization using monocular visual cameras. While structure from motion (SfM) predicts the absolute pose from a point cloud, absolute pose regression (APR) methods learn a semantic understanding of the environment through neural networks. However, both fields face challenges caused by the environment such as motion blur, lighting changes, repetitive patterns, and feature-less structures. This study aims to address these challenges by incorporating additional information and regularizing the absolute pose using relative pose regression (RPR) methods. RPR methods suffer under different challenges, i.e., motion blur. The optical flow between consecutive images is computed using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm, and the relative pose is predicted using an auxiliary small recurrent convolutional network. The fusion of absolute and relative poses is a complex task due to the mismatch between the global and local coordinate systems. State-of-the-art methods fusing absolute and relative poses use pose graph optimization (PGO) to regularize the absolute pose predictions using relative poses. In this work, we propose recurrent fusion networks to optimally align absolute and relative pose predictions to improve the absolute pose prediction. We evaluate eight different recurrent units and construct a simulation environment to pre-train the APR and RPR networks for better generalized training. Additionally, we record a large database of different scenarios in a challenging large-scale indoor environment that mimics a warehouse with transportation robots. We conduct hyperparameter searches and experiments to show the effectiveness of our recurrent fusion method compared to PGO.</description>

Abstract: Real-world data often exhibits bias, imbalance, and privacy risks. Synthetic datasets have emerged to address these issues. This paradigm relies on generative AI models to generate unbiased, privacy-preserving data while maintaining fidelity to the original data. However, assessing the trustworthiness of synthetic datasets and models is a critical challenge. We introduce a holistic auditing framework that comprehensively evaluates synthetic datasets and AI models. It focuses on preventing bias and discrimination, ensures fidelity to the source data, assesses utility, robustness, and privacy preservation. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by auditing various generative models across diverse use cases like education, healthcare, banking, and human resources, spanning different data modalities such as tabular, time-series, vision, and natural language. This holistic assessment is essential for compliance with regulatory safeguards. We introduce a trustworthiness index to rank synthetic datasets based on their safeguards trade-offs. Furthermore, we present a trustworthiness-driven model selection and cross-validation process during training, exemplified with "TrustFormers" across various data types. This approach allows for controllable trustworthiness trade-offs in synthetic data creation. Our auditing framework fosters collaboration among stakeholders, including data scientists, governance experts, internal reviewers, external certifiers, and regulators. This transparent reporting should become a standard practice to prevent bias, discrimination, and privacy violations, ensuring compliance with policies and providing accountability, safety, and performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Why So Gullible? Enhancing the Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Models against Counterfactual Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) assume a naive dichotomy within a retrieved document set: query-relevance and irrelevance. Our work investigates a more challenging scenario in which even the "relevant" documents may contain misleading or incorrect information, causing conflict among the retrieved documents and thereby negatively influencing model decisions as noise. We observe that existing LMs are highly brittle to the presence of conflicting information in both the fine-tuning and in-context few-shot learning scenarios. We propose approaches for handling knowledge conflicts among retrieved documents by explicitly fine-tuning a discriminator or prompting GPT-3.5 to elicit its discriminative capability. Our empirical results on open-domain QA show that these approaches significantly enhance model robustness. We also provide our findings on incorporating the fine-tuned discriminator's decision into the in-context learning process, proposing a way to exploit the benefits of two disparate learning schemes. Alongside our findings, we provide MacNoise, a machine-generated, conflict-induced dataset to further encourage research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Learning to Evaluate the Artness of AI-generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing the artness of AI-generated images continues to be a challenge within the realm of image generation. Most existing metrics cannot be used to perform instance-level and reference-free artness evaluation. This paper presents ArtScore, a metric designed to evaluate the degree to which an image resembles authentic artworks by artists (or conversely photographs), thereby offering a novel approach to artness assessment. We first blend pre-trained models for photo and artwork generation, resulting in a series of mixed models. Subsequently, we utilize these mixed models to generate images exhibiting varying degrees of artness with pseudo-annotations. Each photorealistic image has a corresponding artistic counterpart and a series of interpolated images that range from realistic to artistic. This dataset is then employed to train a neural network that learns to estimate quantized artness levels of arbitrary images. Extensive experiments reveal that the artness levels predicted by ArtScore align more closely with human artistic evaluation than existing evaluation metrics, such as Gram loss and ArtFID.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Medical Image Analysis: The Missed Opportunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08252v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have significantly advanced medical image analysis through the pre-train fine-tune paradigm. Among various fine-tuning algorithms, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is increasingly utilized for knowledge transfer across diverse tasks, including vision-language and text-to-image generation. However, its application in medical image analysis is relatively unexplored due to the lack of a structured benchmark for evaluating PEFT methods. This study fills this gap by evaluating 17 distinct PEFT algorithms across convolutional and transformer-based networks on image classification and text-to-image generation tasks using six medical datasets of varying size, modality, and complexity. Through a battery of over 700 controlled experiments, our findings demonstrate PEFT's effectiveness, particularly in low data regimes common in medical imaging, with performance gains of up to 22% in discriminative and generative tasks. These recommendations can assist the community in incorporating PEFT into their workflows and facilitate fair comparisons of future PEFT methods, ensuring alignment with advancements in other areas of machine learning and AI.</description>

      <title>ReadMe++: Benchmarking Multilingual Language Models for Multi-Domain Readability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of large language models for multilingual readability assessment. Existing evaluation resources lack domain and language diversity, limiting the ability for cross-domain and cross-lingual analyses. This paper introduces ReadMe++, a multilingual multi-domain dataset with human annotations of 9757 sentences in Arabic, English, French, Hindi, and Russian, collected from 112 different data sources. This benchmark will encourage research on developing robust multilingual readability assessment methods. Using ReadMe++, we benchmark multilingual and monolingual language models in the supervised, unsupervised, and few-shot prompting settings. The domain and language diversity in ReadMe++ enable us to test more effective few-shot prompting, and identify shortcomings in state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. Our experiments also reveal exciting results of superior domain generalization and enhanced cross-lingual transfer capabilities by models trained on ReadMe++. We will make our data publicly available and release a python package tool for multilingual sentence readability prediction using our trained models at: https://github.com/tareknaous/readme</description>

      <title>Strokes2Surface: Recovering Curve Networks From 4D Architectural Design Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07220v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Strokes2Surface, an offline geometry reconstruction pipeline that recovers well-connected curve networks from imprecise 4D sketches to bridge concept design and digital modeling stages in architectural design. The input to our pipeline consists of 3D strokes' polyline vertices and their timestamps as the 4th dimension, along with additional metadata recorded throughout sketching. Inspired by architectural sketching practices, our pipeline combines a classifier and two clustering models to achieve its goal. First, with a set of extracted hand-engineered features from the sketch, the classifier recognizes the type of individual strokes between those depicting boundaries (Shape strokes) and those depicting enclosed areas (Scribble strokes). Next, the two clustering models parse strokes of each type into distinct groups, each representing an individual edge or face of the intended architectural object. Curve networks are then formed through topology recovery of consolidated Shape clusters and surfaced using Scribble clusters guiding the cycle discovery. Our evaluation is threefold: We confirm the usability of the Strokes2Surface pipeline in architectural design use cases via a user study, we validate our choice of features via statistical analysis and ablation studies on our collected dataset, and we compare our outputs against a range of reconstructions computed using alternative methods.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Regular Tree Priors for Scientific Symbolic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) allows for the discovery of scientific equations from data. To limit the large search space of possible equations, prior knowledge has been expressed in terms of formal grammars that characterize subsets of arbitrary strings. However, there is a mismatch between context-free grammars required to express the set of syntactically correct equations, missing closure properties of the former, and a tree structure of the latter. Our contributions are to (i) compactly express experts' prior beliefs about which equations are more likely to be expected by probabilistic Regular Tree Expressions (pRTE), and (ii) adapt Bayesian inference to make such priors efficiently available for symbolic regression encoded as finite state machines. Our scientific case studies show its effectiveness in soil science to find sorption isotherms and for modeling hyper-elastic materials.</description>

      <title>FedSelect: Customized Selection of Parameters for Fine-Tuning during Personalized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13264v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in federated learning (FL) seek to increase client-level performance by fine-tuning client parameters on local data or personalizing architectures for the local task. Existing methods for such personalization either prune a global model or fine-tune a global model on a local client distribution. However, these existing methods either personalize at the expense of retaining important global knowledge, or predetermine network layers for fine-tuning, resulting in suboptimal storage of global knowledge within client models. Enlightened by the lottery ticket hypothesis, we first introduce a hypothesis for finding optimal client subnetworks to locally fine-tune while leaving the rest of the parameters frozen. We then propose a novel FL framework, FedSelect, using this procedure that directly personalizes both client subnetwork structure and parameters, via the simultaneous discovery of optimal parameters for personalization and the rest of parameters for global aggregation during training. We show that this method achieves promising results on CIFAR-10.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate four state-of-the-art instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) -- ChatGPT, Flan-T5 UL2, Tk-Instruct, and Alpaca -- on a set of 13 real-world clinical and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) tasks in English, such as named-entity recognition (NER), question-answering (QA), relation extraction (RE), etc. Our overall results demonstrate that the evaluated LLMs begin to approach performance of state-of-the-art models in zero- and few-shot scenarios for most tasks, and particularly well for the QA task, even though they have never seen examples from these tasks before. However, we observed that the classification and RE tasks perform below what can be achieved with a specifically trained model for the medical field, such as PubMedBERT. Finally, we noted that no LLM outperforms all the others on all the studied tasks, with some models being better suited for certain tasks than others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a subset of machine learning, meta-learning, or learning to learn, aims at improving the model's capabilities by employing prior knowledge and experience. A meta-learning paradigm can appropriately tackle the conventional challenges of traditional learning approaches, such as insufficient number of samples, domain shifts, and generalization. These unique characteristics position meta-learning as a suitable choice for developing influential solutions in various healthcare contexts, where the available data is often insufficient, and the data collection methodologies are different. This survey discusses meta-learning broad applications in the healthcare domain to provide insight into how and where it can address critical healthcare challenges. We first describe the theoretical foundations and pivotal methods of meta-learning. We then divide the employed meta-learning approaches in the healthcare domain into two main categories of multi/single-task learning and many/few-shot learning and survey the studies. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in meta-learning research, discuss the potential solutions, and provide future perspectives on meta-learning in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Generalized Independent Noise Condition for Estimating Causal Structure with Latent Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the task of learning causal structure in the presence of latent variables, including locating latent variables and determining their quantity, and identifying causal relationships among both latent and observed variables. To this end, we propose a Generalized Independent Noise (GIN) condition for linear non-Gaussian acyclic causal models that incorporate latent variables, which establishes the independence between a linear combination of certain measured variables and some other measured variables. Specifically, for two observed random vectors $\bf{Y}$ and $\bf{Z}$, GIN holds if and only if $\omega^{\intercal}\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ are independent, where $\omega$ is a non-zero parameter vector determined by the cross-covariance between $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$. We then give necessary and sufficient graphical criteria of the GIN condition in linear non-Gaussian acyclic models. Roughly speaking, GIN implies the existence of a set $\mathcal{S}$ such that $\mathcal{S}$ is causally earlier (w.r.t. the causal ordering) than $\mathbf{Y}$, and that every active (collider-free) path between $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ must contain a node from $\mathcal{S}$. Interestingly, we find that the independent noise condition (i.e., if there is no confounder, causes are independent of the residual derived from regressing the effect on the causes) can be seen as a special case of GIN. With such a connection between GIN and latent causal structures, we further leverage the proposed GIN condition, together with a well-designed search procedure, to efficiently estimate Linear, Non-Gaussian Latent Hierarchical Models (LiNGLaHs), where latent confounders may also be causally related and may even follow a hierarchical structure. We show that the causal structure of a LiNGLaH is identifiable in light of GIN conditions. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>CoMIX: A Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Training Architecture for Efficient Decentralized Coordination and Independent Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust coordination skills enable agents to operate cohesively in shared environments, together towards a common goal and, ideally, individually without hindering each other's progress. To this end, this paper presents Coordinated QMIX (CoMIX), a novel training framework for decentralized agents that enables emergent coordination through flexible policies, allowing at the same time independent decision-making at individual level. CoMIX models selfish and collaborative behavior as incremental steps in each agent's decision process. This allows agents to dynamically adapt their behavior to different situations balancing independence and collaboration. Experiments using a variety of simulation environments demonstrate that CoMIX outperforms baselines on collaborative tasks. The results validate our incremental approach as effective technique for improving coordination in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on Fault Detection and Root Cause Analysis of Indium Tin Oxide Electrodes by Processing S-parameter Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of optoelectronics, indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes play a crucial role in various applications, such as displays, sensors, and solar cells. Effective fault diagnosis and root cause analysis of the ITO electrodes are essential to ensure the performance and reliability of the devices. However, traditional visual inspection is challenging with transparent ITO electrodes, and existing fault diagnosis methods have limitations in determining the root causes of the defects, often requiring destructive evaluations and secondary material characterization techniques. In this study, a fault diagnosis method with root cause analysis is proposed using scattering parameter (S-parameter) patterns, offering early detection, high diagnostic accuracy, and noise robustness. A comprehensive S-parameter pattern database is obtained according to various defect states of the ITO electrodes. Deep learning (DL) approaches, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and transformer, are then used to simultaneously analyze the cause and severity of defects. Notably, it is demonstrated that the diagnostic performance under additive noise levels can be significantly enhanced by combining different channels of the S-parameters as input to the learning algorithms, as confirmed through the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimension reduction visualization of the S-parameter patterns.</description>

      <title>An explainable three dimension framework to uncover learning patterns: A unified look in variable sulci recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting the significant features of the learning process of an artificial intelligence framework in the entire training and validation dataset can be determined as 'global' explanations. Studies in the literature lack of accurate, low-complexity, and three-dimensional (3D) global explanations which are crucial in neuroimaging, a field with a complex representational space that demands more than basic two-dimensional interpretations. To fill this gap, we developed a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) 3D-Framework that provides robust, faithful, and low-complexity global explanations. We evaluated our framework on various 3D deep learning networks trained, validated, and tested on a well-annotated cohort of 596 subjects from the TOP-OSLO study. The focus was on the presence and absence of the paracingulate sulcus, a variable feature of brain morphology correlated with psychotic conditions. Our proposed 3D-Framework outperforms traditional XAI methods in terms of faithfulness for global explanations. As a result, we were able to use these robust explanations to uncover new patterns that not only enhance the credibility and reliability of the training process but also reveal promising new biomarkers and significantly related sub-regions. For the first time, our developed 3D-Framework proposes a way for the scientific community to utilize global explanations to discover novel patterns in this specific neuroscientific application and beyond. This study can helps improve the trustworthiness of AI training processes and push the boundaries of our understanding by revealing new patterns in neuroscience and beyond.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning from Hierarchical Preference Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward design is a fundamental, yet challenging aspect of reinforcement learning (RL). Researchers typically utilize feedback signals from the environment to handcraft a reward function, but this process is not always effective due to the varying scale and intricate dependencies of the feedback signals. This paper shows by exploiting certain structures, one can ease the reward design process. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical reward modeling framework -- HERON for scenarios: (I) The feedback signals naturally present hierarchy; (II) The reward is sparse, but with less important surrogate feedback to help policy learning. Both scenarios allow us to design a hierarchical decision tree induced by the importance ranking of the feedback signals to compare RL trajectories. With such preference data, we can then train a reward model for policy learning. We apply HERON to several RL applications, and we find that our framework can not only train high performing agents on a variety of difficult tasks, but also provide additional benefits such as improved sample efficiency and robustness. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/abukharin3/HERON}.</description>

      <title>Masking Improves Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning for ConvNets, and Saliency Tells You Where</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While image data starts to enjoy the simple-but-effective self-supervised learning scheme built upon masking and self-reconstruction objective thanks to the introduction of tokenization procedure and vision transformer backbone, convolutional neural networks as another important and widely-adopted architecture for image data, though having contrastive-learning techniques to drive the self-supervised learning, still face the difficulty of leveraging such straightforward and general masking operation to benefit their learning process significantly. In this work, we aim to alleviate the burden of including masking operation into the contrastive-learning framework for convolutional neural networks as an extra augmentation method. In addition to the additive but unwanted edges (between masked and unmasked regions) as well as other adverse effects caused by the masking operations for ConvNets, which have been discussed by prior works, we particularly identify the potential problem where for one view in a contrastive sample-pair the randomly-sampled masking regions could be overly concentrated on important/salient objects thus resulting in misleading contrastiveness to the other view. To this end, we propose to explicitly take the saliency constraint into consideration in which the masked regions are more evenly distributed among the foreground and background for realizing the masking-based augmentation. Moreover, we introduce hard negative samples by masking larger regions of salient patches in an input image. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets, contrastive learning mechanisms, and downstream tasks well verify the efficacy as well as the superior performance of our proposed method with respect to several state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>UniHead: Unifying Multi-Perception for Detection Heads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection head constitutes a pivotal component within object detectors, tasked with executing both classification and localization functions. Regrettably, the commonly used parallel head often lacks omni perceptual capabilities, such as deformation perception, global perception and cross-task perception. Despite numerous methods attempting to enhance these abilities from a single aspect, achieving a comprehensive and unified solution remains a significant challenge. In response to this challenge, we develop an innovative detection head, termed UniHead, to unify three perceptual abilities simultaneously. More precisely, our approach (1) introduces deformation perception, enabling the model to adaptively sample object features; (2) proposes a Dual-axial Aggregation Transformer (DAT) to adeptly model long-range dependencies, thereby achieving global perception; and (3) devises a Cross-task Interaction Transformer (CIT) that facilitates interaction between the classification and localization branches, thus aligning the two tasks. As a plug-and-play method, the proposed UniHead can be conveniently integrated with existing detectors. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our UniHead can bring significant improvements to many detectors. For instance, the UniHead can obtain +2.7 AP gains in RetinaNet, +2.9 AP gains in FreeAnchor, and +2.1 AP gains in GFL. The code is available at https://github.com/zht8506/UniHead.</description>

      <title>RL-I2IT: Image-to-Image Translation with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13672v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing Image-to-Image Translation (I2IT) methods generate images in a single run of a deep learning (DL) model. However, designing such a single-step model is always challenging, requiring a huge number of parameters and easily falling into bad global minimums and overfitting. In this work, we reformulate I2IT as a step-wise decision-making problem via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and propose a novel framework that performs RL-based I2IT (RL-I2IT). The key feature in the RL-I2IT framework is to decompose a monolithic learning process into small steps with a lightweight model to progressively transform a source image successively to a target image. Considering that it is challenging to handle high dimensional continuous state and action spaces in the conventional RL framework, we introduce meta policy with a new concept Plan to the standard Actor-Critic model, which is of a lower dimension than the original image and can facilitate the actor to generate a tractable high dimensional action. In the RL-I2IT framework, we also employ a task-specific auxiliary learning strategy to stabilize the training process and improve the performance of the corresponding task. Experiments on several I2IT tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method when facing high-dimensional continuous action space problems. Our implementation of the RL-I2IT framework is available at https://github.com/Algolzw/SPAC-Deformable-Registration.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gut Feel: Using Time Series Transformers to Find Investment Gems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the growing application of data-driven approaches within the Private Equity (PE) industry, particularly in sourcing investment targets (i.e., companies) for Venture Capital (VC) and Growth Capital (GC). We present a comprehensive review of the relevant approaches and propose a novel approach leveraging a Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Classifier (TMTSC) for predicting the success likelihood of any candidate company. The objective of our research is to optimize sourcing performance for VC and GC investments by formally defining the sourcing problem as a multivariate time series classification task. We consecutively introduce the key components of our implementation which collectively contribute to the successful application of TMTSC in VC/GC sourcing: input features, model architecture, optimization target, and investor-centric data processing. Our extensive experiments on two real-world investment tasks, benchmarked towards three popular baselines, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving decision making within the VC and GC industry.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks are popular architectures for graph machine learning, based on iterative computation of node representations of an input graph through a series of invariant transformations. A large class of graph neural networks follow a standard message-passing paradigm: at every layer, each node state is updated based on an aggregate of messages from its neighborhood. In this work, we propose a novel framework for training graph neural networks, where every node is viewed as a player that can choose to either 'listen', 'broadcast', 'listen and broadcast', or to 'isolate'. The standard message propagation scheme can then be viewed as a special case of this framework where every node 'listens and broadcasts' to all neighbors. Our approach offers a more flexible and dynamic message-passing paradigm, where each node can determine its own strategy based on their state, effectively exploring the graph topology while learning. We provide a theoretical analysis of the new message-passing scheme which is further supported by an extensive empirical analysis on a synthetic dataset and on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Fooling the Textual Fooler via Randomizing Latent Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite outstanding performance in a variety of NLP tasks, recent studies have revealed that NLP models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that slightly perturb the input to cause the models to misbehave. Among these attacks, adversarial word-level perturbations are well-studied and effective attack strategies. Since these attacks work in black-box settings, they do not require access to the model architecture or model parameters and thus can be detrimental to existing NLP applications. To perform an attack, the adversary queries the victim model many times to determine the most important words in an input text and to replace these words with their corresponding synonyms. In this work, we propose a lightweight and attack-agnostic defense whose main goal is to perplex the process of generating an adversarial example in these query-based black-box attacks; that is to fool the textual fooler. This defense, named AdvFooler, works by randomizing the latent representation of the input at inference time. Different from existing defenses, AdvFooler does not necessitate additional computational overhead during training nor relies on assumptions about the potential adversarial perturbation set while having a negligible impact on the model's accuracy. Our theoretical and empirical analyses highlight the significance of robustness resulting from confusing the adversary via randomizing the latent space, as well as the impact of randomization on clean accuracy. Finally, we empirically demonstrate near state-of-the-art robustness of AdvFooler against representative adversarial word-level attacks on two benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Expressive Positional Encodings for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing effective positional encodings for graphs is key to building powerful graph transformers and enhancing message-passing graph neural networks. Although widespread, using Laplacian eigenvectors as positional encodings faces two fundamental challenges: (1) \emph{Non-uniqueness}: there are many different eigendecompositions of the same Laplacian, and (2) \emph{Instability}: small perturbations to the Laplacian could result in completely different eigenspaces, leading to unpredictable changes in positional encoding. Despite many attempts to address non-uniqueness, most methods overlook stability, leading to poor generalization on unseen graph structures. We identify the cause of instability to be a ``hard partition'' of eigenspaces. Hence, we introduce Stable and Expressive Positional Encodings (SPE), an architecture for processing eigenvectors that uses eigenvalues to ``softly partition'' eigenspaces. SPE is the first architecture that is (1) provably stable, and (2) universally expressive for basis invariant functions whilst respecting all symmetries of eigenvectors. Besides guaranteed stability, we prove that SPE is at least as expressive as existing methods, and highly capable of counting graph structures. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on molecular property prediction, and out-of-distribution generalization tasks, finding improved generalization compared to existing positional encoding methods. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/Graph-COM/SPE}.</description>

Abstract: Making neural networks remember over the long term has been a longstanding issue. Although several external memory techniques have been introduced, most focus on retaining recent information in the short term. Regardless of its importance, information tends to be fatefully forgotten over time. We present Memoria, a memory system for artificial neural networks, drawing inspiration from humans and applying various neuroscientific and psychological theories. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of Memoria in the diverse tasks of sorting, language modeling, and classification, surpassing conventional techniques. Engram analysis reveals that Memoria exhibits the primacy, recency, and temporal contiguity effects which are characteristics of human memory.</description>

      <title>Evading Community Detection via Counterfactual Neighborhood Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection techniques are useful for social media platforms to discover tightly connected groups of users who share common interests. However, this functionality often comes at the expense of potentially exposing individuals to privacy breaches by inadvertently revealing their tastes or preferences. Therefore, some users may wish to preserve their anonymity and opt out of community detection for various reasons, such as affiliation with political or religious organizations, without leaving the platform. In this study, we address the challenge of community membership hiding, which involves strategically altering the structural properties of a network graph to prevent one or more nodes from being identified by a given community detection algorithm. We tackle this problem by formulating it as a constrained counterfactual graph objective, and we solve it via deep reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, striking the best balance between accuracy and cost.</description>

      <title>Demonstrations Are All You Need: Advancing Offensive Content Paraphrasing using In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Paraphrasing of offensive content is a better alternative to content removal and helps improve civility in a communication environment. Supervised paraphrasers; however, rely heavily on large quantities of labelled data to help preserve meaning and intent. They also often retain a large portion of the offensiveness of the original content, which raises questions on their overall usability. In this paper we aim to assist practitioners in developing usable paraphrasers by exploring In-Context Learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs), i.e., using a limited number of input-label demonstration pairs to guide the model in generating desired outputs for specific queries. Our study focuses on key factors such as - number and order of demonstrations, exclusion of prompt instruction, and reduction in measured toxicity. We perform principled evaluation on three datasets, including our proposed Context-Aware Polite Paraphrase (CAPP) dataset, comprising of dialogue-style rude utterances, polite paraphrases, and additional dialogue context. We evaluate our approach using four closed source and one open source LLM. Our results reveal that ICL is comparable to supervised methods in generation quality, while being qualitatively better by 25% on human evaluation and attaining lower toxicity by 76%. Also, ICL-based paraphrasers only show a slight reduction in performance even with just 10% training data.</description>

      <title>From Alexnet to Transformers: Measuring the Non-linearity of Deep Neural Networks with Affine Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, we have witnessed the introduction of several novel deep neural network (DNN) architectures exhibiting ever-increasing performance across diverse tasks. Explaining the upward trend of their performance, however, remains difficult as different DNN architectures of comparable depth and width -- common factors associated with their expressive power -- may exhibit a drastically different performance even when trained on the same dataset. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the non-linearity signature of DNN, the first theoretically sound solution for approximately measuring the non-linearity of deep neural networks. Built upon a score derived from closed-form optimal transport mappings, this signature provides a better understanding of the inner workings of a wide range of DNN architectures and learning paradigms, with a particular emphasis on the computer vision task. We provide extensive experimental results that highlight the practical usefulness of the proposed non-linearity signature and its potential for long-reaching implications.

      <title>AlpaCare:Instruction-tuned Large Language Models for Medical Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14558v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction-finetuning (IFT) has become crucial in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human needs and has shown great potential in medical applications. However, previous studies mainly fine-tune LLMs on biomedical datasets with limited diversity, which often rely on benchmarks or narrow task scopes, and hence significantly limit the effectiveness on their medical instruction-following ability and generalizability. To bridge this gap, we propose creating a diverse, machine-generated medical IFT dataset, MedInstruct-52k, using GPT-4 and ChatGPT with a high-quality expert-curated seed set. We then fine-tune LLaMA-series models on the dataset to develop AlpaCare. Despite using a smaller domain-specific dataset than previous medical LLMs, AlpaCare not only demonstrates superior performance on medical applications, with up to 38.1% absolute gain over best baselines in medical free-form instruction evaluations, but also achieves 6.7% absolute gains averaged over multiple general domain benchmarks. Human evaluation further shows that AlpaCare consistently outperforms best baselines in terms of both correctness and helpfulness. We offer public access to our data, model, and codebase in https://github.com/XZhang97666/AlpaCare.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Energy Efficiency in Deep Learning: Measurement, Prediction, and Scoring across Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, deep learning optimization is primarily driven by research focused on achieving high inference accuracy and reducing latency. However, the energy efficiency aspect is often overlooked, possibly due to a lack of sustainability mindset in the field and the absence of a holistic energy dataset. In this paper, we conduct a threefold study, including energy measurement, prediction, and efficiency scoring, with an objective to foster transparency in power and energy consumption within deep learning across various edge devices. Firstly, we present a detailed, first-of-its-kind measurement study that uncovers the energy consumption characteristics of on-device deep learning. This study results in the creation of three extensive energy datasets for edge devices, covering a wide range of kernels, state-of-the-art DNN models, and popular AI applications. Secondly, we design and implement the first kernel-level energy predictors for edge devices based on our kernel-level energy dataset. Evaluation results demonstrate the ability of our predictors to provide consistent and accurate energy estimations on unseen DNN models. Lastly, we introduce two scoring metrics, PCS and IECS, developed to convert complex power and energy consumption data of an edge device into an easily understandable manner for edge device end-users. We hope our work can help shift the mindset of both end-users and the research community towards sustainability in edge computing, a principle that drives our research.

      <title>Automating the Correctness Assessment of AI-generated Code for Security Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the correctness of code generated by AI is a challenging open problem. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method, named ACCA, to evaluate the correctness of AI-generated code for security purposes. The method uses symbolic execution to assess whether the AI-generated code behaves as a reference implementation. We use ACCA to assess four state-of-the-art models trained to generate security-oriented assembly code and compare the results of the evaluation with different baseline solutions, including output similarity metrics, widely used in the field, and the well-known ChatGPT, the AI-powered language model developed by OpenAI. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline solutions and assesses the correctness of the AI-generated code similar to the human-based evaluation, which is considered the ground truth for the assessment in the field. Moreover, ACCA has a very strong correlation with the human evaluation (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.84 on average). Finally, since it is a fully automated solution that does not require any human intervention, the proposed method performs the assessment of every code snippet in ~0.17s on average, which is definitely lower than the average time required by human analysts to manually inspect the code, based on our experience.</description>

      <title>Offline Imitation from Observation via Primal Wasserstein State Occupancy Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, arbitrary interactions with the environment can often be costly, and actions of expert demonstrations are not always available. To reduce the need for both, offline Learning from Observations (LfO) is extensively studied: the agent learns to solve a task given only expert states and task-agnostic non-expert state-action pairs. The state-of-the-art DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE) methods, as exemplified by SMODICE, minimize the state occupancy divergence between the learner's and empirical expert policies. However, such methods are limited to either $f$-divergences (KL and $chi^2$) or Wasserstein distance with Rubinstein duality, the latter of which constrains the underlying distance metric crucial to the performance of Wasserstein-based solutions. To enable more flexible distance metrics, we propose Primal Wasserstein DICE (PW-DICE). It minimizes the primal Wasserstein distance between the learner and expert state occupancies and leverages a contrastively learned distance metric. Theoretically, our framework is a generalization of SMODICE, and is the first work that unifies $f$-divergence and Wasserstein minimization. Empirically, we find that PW-DICE improves upon several state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/KaiYan289/PW-DICE.</description>

      <title>Knowledgeable Preference Alignment for LLMs in Domain-specific Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) to real scenarios for domain-specific question answering (QA) is a key thrust for LLM applications, which poses numerous challenges, especially in ensuring that responses are both accommodating to user requirements and appropriately leveraging domain-specific knowledge bases. They are the two major difficulties for LLM application as vanilla fine-tuning falls short of addressing. Combining these requirements, we conceive of them as the requirement for the model's preference to be harmoniously aligned with humans'. Thus, we introduce Knowledgeable Preference AlignmenT (KnowPAT), which constructs two kinds of preference sets to tackle the two issues. Besides, we design a new alignment objective to align the LLM preference with different human preferences uniformly, aiming to optimize LLM performance in real-world, domain-specific QA settings. Adequate experiments and comprehensive comparisons with 15 baseline methods illustrate that our KnowPAT is a superior pipeline for real-scenario domain-specific QA with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Kuro Siwo: 33 billion $m^2$ under the water. A global multi-temporal satellite dataset for rapid flood mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global floods, exacerbated by climate change, pose severe threats to human life, infrastructure, and the environment. Recent catastrophic events in Pakistan and New Zealand underscore the urgent need for precise flood mapping to guide restoration efforts, understand vulnerabilities, and prepare for future occurrences. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing offers day-and-night, all-weather imaging capabilities, its application in deep learning for flood segmentation is limited by the lack of large annotated datasets. To address this, we introduce Kuro Siwo, a manually annotated multi-temporal dataset, spanning 43 flood events globally. Our dataset maps more than 338 billion $m^2$ of land, with 33 billion designated as either flooded areas or permanent water bodies. Kuro Siwo includes a highly processed product optimized for flood mapping based on SAR Ground Range Detected, and a primal SAR Single Look Complex product with minimal preprocessing, designed to promote research on the exploitation of both the phase and amplitude information and to offer maximum flexibility for downstream task preprocessing. To leverage advances in large scale self-supervised pretraining methods for remote sensing data, we augment Kuro Siwo with a large unlabeled set of SAR samples. Finally, we provide an extensive benchmark, namely BlackBench, offering strong baselines for a diverse set of flood events from Europe, America, Africa, Asia and Australia.</description>

      <title>Moving Sampling Physics-informed Neural Networks induced by Moving Mesh PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an end-to-end adaptive sampling neural network (MMPDE-Net) based on the moving mesh method, which can adaptively generate new sampling points by solving the moving mesh PDE. This model focuses on improving the quality of sampling points generation. Moreover, we develop an iterative algorithm based on MMPDE-Net, which makes the sampling points more precise and controllable. Since MMPDE-Net is a framework independent of the deep learning solver, we combine it with physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to propose moving sampling PINN (MS-PINN) and demonstrate its effectiveness by error analysis under some assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate the performance improvement of MS-PINN compared to PINN through numerical experiments of four typical examples, which numerically verify the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Stealthy and Persistent Unalignment on Large Language Models via Backdoor Injections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have manifested significant advancements. To facilitate safeguards against malicious exploitation, a body of research has concentrated on aligning LLMs with human preferences and inhibiting their generation of inappropriate content. Unfortunately, such alignments are often vulnerable: fine-tuning with a minimal amount of harmful data can easily unalign the target LLM. While being effective, such fine-tuning-based unalignment approaches also have their own limitations: (1) non-stealthiness, after fine-tuning, safety audits or red-teaming can easily expose the potential weaknesses of the unaligned models, thereby precluding their release/use. (2) non-persistence, the unaligned LLMs can be easily repaired through re-alignment, i.e., fine-tuning again with aligned data points. In this work, we show that it is possible to conduct stealthy and persistent unalignment on large language models via backdoor injections. We also provide a novel understanding on the relationship between the backdoor persistence and the activation pattern and further provide guidelines for potential trigger design. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed stealthy and persistent unalignment can successfully pass the safety evaluation while maintaining strong persistence against re-alignment defense.</description>

      <title>uSF: Learning Neural Semantic Field with Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increased interest in NeRF methods which reconstruct differentiable representation of three-dimensional scenes. One of the main limitations of such methods is their inability to assess the confidence of the model in its predictions. In this paper, we propose a new neural network model for the formation of extended vector representations, called uSF, which allows the model to predict not only color and semantic label of each point, but also estimate the corresponding values of uncertainty. We show that with a small number of images available for training, a model quantifying uncertainty performs better than a model without such functionality. Code of the uSF approach is publicly available at https://github.com/sevashasla/usf/.</description>

      <title>Movement Primitive Diffusion: Learning Gentle Robotic Manipulation of Deformable Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy learning in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) lacks data efficient and versatile methods that exhibit the desired motion quality for delicate surgical interventions. To this end, we introduce Movement Primitive Diffusion (MPD), a novel method for imitation learning (IL) in RAS that focuses on gentle manipulation of deformable objects. The approach combines the versatility of diffusion-based imitation learning (DIL) with the high-quality motion generation capabilities of Probabilistic Dynamic Movement Primitives (ProDMPs). This combination enables MPD to achieve gentle manipulation of deformable objects, while maintaining data efficiency critical for RAS applications where demonstration data is scarce. We evaluate MPD across various simulated and real world robotic tasks on both state and image observations. MPD outperforms state-of-the-art DIL methods in success rate, motion quality, and data efficiency.

      <title>Sparse is Enough in Fine-tuning Pre-trained Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the prevalence of pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm, how to efficiently adapt the pre-trained model to the downstream tasks has been an intriguing issue. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed for low-cost adaptation. Although PEFT has demonstrated effectiveness and been widely applied, the underlying principles are still unclear. In this paper, we adopt the PAC-Bayesian generalization error bound, viewing pre-training as a shift of prior distribution which leads to a tighter bound for generalization error. We validate this shift from the perspectives of oscillations in the loss landscape and the quasi-sparsity in gradient distribution. Based on this, we propose a gradient-based sparse fine-tuning algorithm, named Sparse Increment Fine-Tuning (SIFT), and validate its effectiveness on a range of tasks including the GLUE Benchmark and Instruction-tuning. The code is accessible at https://github.com/song-wx/SIFT/.</description>

      <title>Effective Causal Discovery under Identifiable Heteroscedastic Noise Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capturing the underlying structural causal relations represented by Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) has been a fundamental task in various AI disciplines. Causal DAG learning via the continuous optimization framework has recently achieved promising performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. However, most methods make strong assumptions of homoscedastic noise, i.e., exogenous noises have equal variances across variables, observations, or even both. The noises in real data usually violate both assumptions due to the biases introduced by different data collection processes. To address the issue of heteroscedastic noise, we introduce relaxed and implementable sufficient conditions, proving the identifiability of a general class of SEM subject to these conditions. Based on the identifiable general SEM, we propose a novel formulation for DAG learning that accounts for the variation in noise variance across variables and observations. We then propose an effective two-phase iterative DAG learning algorithm to address the increasing optimization difficulties and to learn a causal DAG from data with heteroscedastic variable noise under varying variance. We show significant empirical gains of the proposed approaches over state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and real data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design probes trained on the internal representations of a transformer language model to predict its hallucinatory behavior on three grounded generation tasks. To train the probes, we annotate for span-level hallucination on both sampled (organic) and manually edited (synthetic) reference outputs. Our probes are narrowly trained and we find that they are sensitive to their training domain: they generalize poorly from one task to another or from synthetic to organic hallucinations. However, on in-domain data, they can reliably detect hallucinations at many transformer layers, achieving 95% of their peak performance as early as layer 4. Here, probing proves accurate for evaluating hallucination, outperforming several contemporary baselines and even surpassing an expert human annotator in response-level detection F1. Similarly, on span-level labeling, probes are on par or better than the expert annotator on two out of three generation tasks. Overall, we find that probing is a feasible and efficient alternative to language model hallucination evaluation when model states are available.</description>

      <title>DiffDA: a Diffusion Model for Weather-scale Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of initial conditions via accurate data assimilation is crucial for weather forecasting and climate modeling. We propose DiffDA as a denoising diffusion model capable of assimilating atmospheric variables using predicted states and sparse observations. Acknowledging the similarity between a weather forecast model and a denoising diffusion model dedicated to weather applications, we adapt the pretrained GraphCast neural network as the backbone of the diffusion model. Through experiments based on simulated observations from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, our method can produce assimilated global atmospheric data consistent with observations at 0.25 deg (~30km) resolution globally. This marks the highest resolution achieved by ML data assimilation models. The experiments also show that the initial conditions assimilated from sparse observations (less than 0.96% of gridded data) and 48-hour forecast can be used for forecast models with a loss of lead time of at most 24 hours compared to initial conditions from state-of-the-art data assimilation in ERA5. This enables the application of the method to real-world applications, such as creating reanalysis datasets with autoregressive data assimilation.</description>

      <title>CHAMP: A Competition-level Dataset for Fine-Grained Analyses of LLMs' Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown indications of mathematical reasoning ability on challenging competition-level problems, especially with self-generated verbalizations of intermediate reasoning steps (i.e., chain-of-thought prompting). However, current evaluations mainly focus on the end-to-end final answer correctness, and it is unclear whether LLMs can make use of helpful side information such as problem-specific hints. In this paper, we propose a challenging benchmark dataset for enabling such analyses. The Concept and Hint-Annotated Math Problems (CHAMP) consists of high school math competition problems, annotated with concepts, or general math facts, and hints, or problem-specific tricks. These annotations allow us to explore the effects of additional information, such as relevant hints, misleading concepts, or related problems. This benchmark is difficult, with the best model only scoring 58.1% in standard settings. With concepts and hints, performance sometimes improves, indicating that some models can make use of such side information. Furthermore, we annotate model-generated solutions for their correctness. Using this corpus, we find that models often arrive at the correct final answer through wrong reasoning steps. In addition, we test whether models are able to verify these solutions, and find that most models struggle.</description>

      <title>Model Editing at Scale leads to Gradual and Catastrophic Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07453v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Editing knowledge in large language models is an attractive capability to have which allows us to correct incorrectly learnt facts during pre-training, as well as update the model with an ever-growing list of new facts. While existing model editing techniques have shown promise, they are usually evaluated using metrics for reliability, specificity and generalization over one or few edits. We argue that for model editing to have practical utility, we must be able to make multiple edits to the same model. With this in mind, we evaluate the current model editing methods at scale, focusing on two state of the art methods: ROME and MEMIT. We find that as the model is edited sequentially with multiple facts, it continually forgets previously edited facts and the ability to perform downstream tasks. This forgetting happens in two phases -- an initial gradual but progressive forgetting phase followed by abrupt or catastrophic forgetting phase. Both gradual and catastrophic forgetting limit the usefulness of model editing methods at scale -- the former making model editing less effective as multiple edits are made to the model while the latter caps the scalability of such model editing methods. Our analysis also highlights other key limitations of ROME and MEMIT at scale. With our work, we push for the development and evaluation of model editing methods keeping scalability in mind.</description>

      <title>DeepEdit: Knowledge Editing as Decoding with Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Answering multi-hop questions involving new knowledge is a challenging task in evaluating large language models' (LLMs) knowledge editing (KE) methods. This task is rather difficult because the LLMs' hallucinations on new knowledge would harm the logical coherence of LLMs' multi-hop reasoning and lead to incorrect answers. To address this issue, we design decoding constraints to "regulate" LLMs' reasoning, enhancing logical coherence when incorporating new knowledge. We incorporate the constraints into a new KE framework: DEEPEDIT (Depth-first Search-based Constrained Decoding for Knowledge Editing), which enhances LLMs to generate coherent reasoning chains with new knowledge through a depth-first search. Our search selects the most important knowledge that satisfies our constraints as the reasoning step to efficiently increase the reasoning depth. In addition to DEEPEDIT, we propose two new KE benchmarks: MQUAKE-2002 and MQUAKE-HARD, which provide more precise and challenging assessments of KE approaches. Qualitatively, DEEPEDIT enables LLMs to produce succinct and coherent reasoning chains involving new knowledge. Quantitatively, it yields significant improvements on multiple KE benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MLLMReID: Multimodal Large Language Model-based Person Re-identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLM) have achieved satisfactory results in many tasks. However, their performance in the task of ReID (ReID) has not been explored to date. This paper will investigate how to adapt them for the task of ReID. An intuitive idea is to fine-tune MLLM with ReID image-text datasets, and then use their visual encoder as a backbone for ReID. However, there still exist two apparent issues: (1) Designing instructions for ReID, MLLMs may overfit specific instructions, and designing a variety of instructions will lead to higher costs. (2) When fine-tuning the visual encoder of a MLLM, it is not trained synchronously with the ReID task. As a result, the effectiveness of the visual encoder fine-tuning cannot be directly reflected in the performance of the ReID task. To address these problems, this paper proposes MLLMReID: Multimodal Large Language Model-based ReID. Firstly, we proposed Common Instruction, a simple approach that leverages the essence ability of LLMs to continue writing, avoiding complex and diverse instruction design. Secondly, we propose a multi-task learning-based synchronization module to ensure that the visual encoder of the MLLM is trained synchronously with the ReID task. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>BPDec: Unveiling the Potential of Masked Language Modeling Decoder in BERT pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing through its exceptional performance on numerous tasks. Yet, the majority of researchers have mainly concentrated on enhancements related to the model structure, such as relative position embedding and more efficient attention mechanisms. Others have delved into pretraining tricks associated with Masked Language Modeling, including whole word masking. DeBERTa introduced an enhanced decoder adapted for BERT's encoder model for pretraining, proving to be highly effective. We argue that the design and research around enhanced masked language modeling decoders have been underappreciated. In this paper, we propose several designs of enhanced decoders and introduce BPDec (BERT Pretraining Decoder), a novel method for modeling training. Typically, a pretrained BERT model is fine-tuned for specific Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. In our approach, we utilize the original BERT model as the encoder, making only changes to the decoder without altering the encoder. This approach does not necessitate extensive modifications to the encoder architecture and can be seamlessly integrated into existing fine-tuning pipelines and services, offering an efficient and effective enhancement strategy. Compared to other methods, while we also incur a moderate training cost for the decoder during the pretraining process, our approach does not introduce additional training costs during the fine-tuning phase. We test multiple enhanced decoder structures after pretraining and evaluate their performance on the GLUE tasks and SQuAD tasks. Our results demonstrate that BPDec, having only undergone subtle refinements to the model structure during pretraining, significantly enhances model performance without escalating the finetuning cost, inference time and serving budget.</description>

Abstract: Security code review, as a time-consuming and labour-intensive process, typically requires integration with automated security defect detection tools to ensure code security. Despite the emergence of numerous security analysis tools, those tools face challenges in terms of their poor generalization, high false positive rates, and coarse detection granularity. A recent development with Large Language Models (LLMs) has made them a promising candidate to support security code review. To this end, we conducted the first empirical study to understand the capabilities of LLMs in security code review, delving into the performance, quality problems, and influential factors of LLMs to detect security defects in code reviews. Specifically, we compared the performance of 6 LLMs under five different prompts with the state-of-the-art static analysis tools to detect and analyze security defects. For the best-performing LLM, we conducted a linguistic analysis to explore quality problems in its responses, as well as a regression analysis to investigate the factors influencing its performance. The results are that: (1) existing pre-trained LLMs have limited capability in detecting security defects during code review but significantly outperform the state-of-the-art static analysis tools. (2) GPT-4 performs best among all LLMs when provided with a CWE list for reference. (3) GPT-4 makes few factual errors but frequently generates unnecessary content or responses that are not compliant with the task requirements given in the prompts. (4) GPT-4 is more adept at identifying security defects in code files with fewer tokens, containing functional logic and written by developers with less involvement in the project.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep graph models (e.g., graph neural networks and graph transformers) have become important techniques for leveraging knowledge across various types of graphs. Yet, the scaling properties of deep graph models have not been systematically investigated, casting doubt on the feasibility of achieving large graph models through enlarging the model and dataset sizes. In this work, we delve into neural scaling laws on graphs from both model and data perspectives. We first verify the validity of such laws on graphs, establishing formulations to describe the scaling behaviors. For model scaling, we investigate the phenomenon of scaling law collapse and identify overfitting as the potential reason. Moreover, we reveal that the model depth of deep graph models can impact the model scaling behaviors, which differ from observations in other domains such as CV and NLP. For data scaling, we suggest that the number of graphs can not effectively metric the graph data volume in scaling law since the sizes of different graphs are highly irregular. Instead, we reform the data scaling law with the number of edges as the metric to address the irregular graph sizes. We further demonstrate the reformed law offers a unified view of the data scaling behaviors for various fundamental graph tasks including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. This work provides valuable insights into neural scaling laws on graphs, which can serve as an essential step toward large graph models.</description>

      <title>Stereographic Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing spherical probability distributions is of great interest in various fields, including geology, medical domains, computer vision, and deep representation learning. The utility of optimal transport-based distances, such as the Wasserstein distance, for comparing probability measures has spurred active research in developing computationally efficient variations of these distances for spherical probability measures. This paper introduces a high-speed and highly parallelizable distance for comparing spherical measures using the stereographic projection and the generalized Radon transform, which we refer to as the Stereographic Spherical Sliced Wasserstein (S3W) distance. We carefully address the distance distortion caused by the stereographic projection and provide an extensive theoretical analysis of our proposed metric and its rotationally invariant variation. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed metrics and compare them with recent baselines in terms of both speed and accuracy through a wide range of numerical studies, including gradient flows and self-supervised learning.

      <title>BRAIn: Bayesian Reward-conditioned Amortized Inference for natural language generation from feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distribution matching methods for language model alignment such as Generation with Distributional Control (GDC) and Distributional Policy Gradient (DPG) have not received the same level of attention in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) as contrastive methods such as Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants. We identify high variance of the gradient estimate as the primary reason for the lack of success of these methods and propose a self-normalized baseline to reduce the variance. We further generalize the target distribution in DPG, GDC and DPO by using Bayes' rule to define the reward-conditioned posterior. The resulting approach, referred to as BRAIn - Bayesian Reward-conditioned Amortized Inference acts as a bridge between distribution matching methods and DPO and significantly outperforms prior art in summarization and Antropic HH tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantized Approximately Orthogonal Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Orthogonal Recurrent Neural Networks (ORNNs) have gained popularity due to their ability to manage tasks involving long-term dependencies, such as the copy-task, and their linear complexity. However, existing ORNNs utilize full precision weights and activations, which prevents their deployment on compact devices.In this paper, we explore the quantization of the weight matrices in ORNNs, leading to Quantized approximately Orthogonal RNNs (QORNNs). The construction of such networks remained an open problem, acknowledged for its inherent instability. We propose and investigate two strategies to learn QORNN  by combining  quantization-aware training (QAT) and orthogonal projections. We also study  post-training quantization of the activations for pure integer computation of the recurrent loop. The most efficient models achieve results similar to state-of-the-art full-precision ORNN, LSTM and FastRNN on a variety of standard benchmarks, even with 4-bits quantization.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Large Language Models on Communicative Medical Coaching: a Novel System and Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional applications of natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare have predominantly focused on patient-centered services, enhancing patient interactions and care delivery, such as through medical dialogue systems. However, the potential of NLP to benefit inexperienced doctors, particularly in areas such as communicative medical coaching, remains largely unexplored. We introduce "ChatCoach", a human-AI cooperative framework designed to assist medical learners in practicing their communication skills during patient consultations. ChatCoach (Our data and code are available online: https://github.com/zerowst/Chatcoach)differentiates itself from conventional dialogue systems by offering a simulated environment where medical learners can practice dialogues with a patient agent, while a coach agent provides immediate, structured feedback. This is facilitated by our proposed Generalized Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) approach, which fosters the generation of structured feedback and enhances the utilization of external knowledge sources. Additionally, we have developed a dataset specifically for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) within the ChatCoach framework on communicative medical coaching tasks. Our empirical results validate the effectiveness of ChatCoach.</description>

      <title>AttnLRP: Attention-Aware Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation for Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are prone to biased predictions and hallucinations, underlining the paramount importance of understanding their model-internal reasoning process. However, achieving faithful attributions for the entirety of a black-box transformer model and maintaining computational efficiency is an unsolved challenge. By extending the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation attribution method to handle attention layers, we address these challenges effectively. While partial solutions exist, our method is the first to faithfully and holistically attribute not only input but also latent representations of transformer models with the computational efficiency similar to a single backward pass. Through extensive evaluations against existing methods on LLaMa 2, Mixtral 8x7b, Flan-T5 and vision transformer architectures, we demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses alternative methods in terms of faithfulness and enables the understanding of latent representations, opening up the door for concept-based explanations. We provide an LRP library at https://github.com/rachtibat/LRP-eXplains-Transformers.</description>

      <title>Self-Alignment of Large Language Models via Monopolylogue-based Social Scene Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is imperative to mitigate potential adverse effects resulting from their misuse. Drawing from the sociological insight that acknowledging all parties' concerns is a key factor in shaping human values, this paper proposes a novel direction to align LLMs by themselves: social scene simulation. To achieve this, we present MATRIX, a novel social scene simulator that emulates realistic scenes around a user's input query, enabling the LLM to take social consequences into account before responding. MATRIX serves as a virtual rehearsal space, akin to a Monopolylogue, where the LLM performs diverse roles related to the query and practice by itself. To inject this alignment, we fine-tune the LLM with MATRIX-simulated data, ensuring adherence to human values without compromising inference speed. We theoretically show that the LLM with MATRIX outperforms Constitutional AI under mild assumptions. Finally, extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms over 10 baselines across 4 benchmarks. As evidenced by 875 user ratings, our tuned 13B-size LLM exceeds GPT-4 in aligning with human values. See our project page at https://shuotang123.github.io/MATRIX.</description>

      <title>Fight Back Against Jailbreaking via Prompt Adversarial Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly with a particular focus on harmful content filtering or heuristical defensive prompt designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through the prompts remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both black-box and white-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0 while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task. The proposed defense strategy incurs only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security.

      <title>Self-Correcting Self-Consuming Loops for Generative Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As synthetic data becomes higher quality and proliferates on the internet, machine learning models are increasingly trained on a mix of human- and machine-generated data. Despite the successful stories of using synthetic data for representation learning, using synthetic data for generative model training creates "self-consuming loops" which may lead to training instability or even collapse, unless certain conditions are met. Our paper aims to stabilize self-consuming generative model training. Our theoretical results demonstrate that by introducing an idealized correction function, which maps a data point to be more likely under the true data distribution, self-consuming loops can be made exponentially more stable. We then propose self-correction functions, which rely on expert knowledge (e.g. the laws of physics programmed in a simulator), and aim to approximate the idealized corrector automatically and at scale. We empirically validate the effectiveness of self-correcting self-consuming loops on the challenging human motion synthesis task, and observe that it successfully avoids model collapse, even when the ratio of synthetic data to real data is as high as 100%.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deep Learning Via Expectation Maximization and Turbo Deep Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient learning and model compression algorithm for deep neural network (DNN) is a key workhorse behind the rise of deep learning (DL). In this work, we propose a message passing based Bayesian deep learning algorithm called EM-TDAMP to avoid the drawbacks of traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based learning algorithms and regularization-based model compression methods. Specifically, we formulate the problem of DNN learning and compression as a sparse Bayesian inference problem, in which group sparse prior is employed to achieve structured model compression. Then, we propose an expectation maximization (EM) framework to estimate posterior distributions for parameters (E-step) and update hyperparameters (M-step), where the E-step is realized by a newly proposed turbo deep approximate message passing (TDAMP) algorithm. We further extend the EM-TDAMP and propose a novel Bayesian federated learning framework, in which and the clients perform TDAMP to efficiently calculate the local posterior distributions based on the local data, and the central server first aggregates the local posterior distributions to update the global posterior distributions and then update hyperparameters based on EM to accelerate convergence. We detail the application of EM-TDAMP to Boston housing price prediction and handwriting recognition, and present extensive numerical results to demonstrate the advantages of EM-TDAMP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controllable music generation plays a vital role in human-AI music co-creation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-quality music, their focus on autoregressive generation limits their utility in music editing tasks. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach leveraging a parameter-efficient heterogeneous adapter combined with a masking training scheme. This approach enables autoregressive language models to seamlessly address music inpainting tasks. Additionally, our method integrates frame-level content-based controls, facilitating track-conditioned music refinement and score-conditioned music arrangement. We apply this method to fine-tune MusicGen, a leading autoregressive music generation model. Our experiments demonstrate promising results across multiple music editing tasks, offering more flexible controls for future AI-driven music editing tools.

      <title>Selective Reflection-Tuning: Student-Selected Data Recycling for LLM Instruction-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is critical to large language models (LLMs) for achieving better instruction following and task adaptation capabilities but its success heavily relies on the training data quality. Many recent methods focus on improving the data quality but often overlook the compatibility of the data with the student model being finetuned. This paper introduces Selective Reflection-Tuning, a novel paradigm that synergizes a teacher LLM's reflection and introspection for improving existing data quality with the data selection capability of the student LLM, to automatically refine existing instruction-tuning data. This teacher-student collaboration produces high-quality and student-compatible instruction-response pairs, resulting in sample-efficient instruction tuning and LLMs of superior performance. Selective Reflection-Tuning is a data augmentation and synthesis that generally improves LLM finetuning and self-improvement without collecting brand-new data. We apply our method to Alpaca and WizardLM data and achieve much stronger and top-tier 7B and 13B LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility in recent years, offering potential applications across specialized domains such as healthcare and medicine. Despite the availability of various open-source LLMs tailored for health contexts, adapting general-purpose LLMs to the medical domain presents significant challenges. In this paper, we introduce BioMistral, an open-source LLM tailored for the biomedical domain, utilizing Mistral as its foundation model and further pre-trained on PubMed Central. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of BioMistral on a benchmark comprising 10 established medical question-answering (QA) tasks in English. We also explore lightweight models obtained through quantization and model merging approaches. Our results demonstrate BioMistral's superior performance compared to existing open-source medical models and its competitive edge against proprietary counterparts. Finally, to address the limited availability of data beyond English and to assess the multilingual generalization of medical LLMs, we automatically translated and evaluated this benchmark into 7 other languages. This marks the first large-scale multilingual evaluation of LLMs in the medical domain. Datasets, multilingual evaluation benchmarks, scripts, and all the models obtained during our experiments are freely released.</description>

      <title>Random Projection Layers for Multidimensional Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All-Multi-Layer Perceptron (all-MLP) mixer models have been shown to be effective for time series forecasting problems. However, when such a model is applied to high-dimensional time series (e.g., the time series in a spatial-temporal dataset), its performance is likely to degrade due to overfitting issues. In this paper, we propose an all-MLP time series forecasting architecture, referred to as RPMixer. Our method leverages the ensemble-like behavior of deep neural networks, where each individual block within the network acts like a base learner in an ensemble model, especially when identity mapping residual connections are incorporated. By integrating random projection layers into our model, we increase the diversity among the blocks' outputs, thereby enhancing the overall performance of RPMixer. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale spatial-temporal forecasting benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms alternative methods, including both spatial-temporal graph models and general forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Speak For Diverse People? Tuning LLMs via Debate to Generate Controllable Controversial Statements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making LLMs speak for different, especially minority groups of people, and generate statements supporting their diverse or even controversial perspectives is critical to creating an inclusive environment. However, existing LLMs lack sufficient controllability to the stance of their generated content, which often contains inconsistent, neutral, or biased statements. In this paper, we improve the controllability of LLMs in generating statements supporting an argument the user defined in the prompt. We find that multi-round debates between two LLMs with opposite stances generate higher-quality and more salient statements for each, which are important training data to improve the controllability of LLMs. Motivated by this, we develop a novel debate &amp; tuning (DEBATUNE) pipeline finetuning LLMs to generate the statements obtained via debate. To examine DEBATUNE, we curate the largest dataset of debate topics so far, which covers 710 controversial topics and corresponding arguments for each topic. Evaluations by the GPT-4 judge with a novel controversy controllability metric show that LLMs' capability of generating diverse perspectives is significantly improved by DEBATUNE. Moreover, such controllability can be generalized to unseen topics, generating high-quality statements supporting controversial arguments.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Forecasting with Missing Data through Spatiotemporal Downsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set of synchronous time series, each associated with a sensor-point in space and characterized by inter-series relationships, the problem of spatiotemporal forecasting consists of predicting future observations for each point. Spatiotemporal graph neural networks achieve striking results by representing the relationships across time series as a graph. Nonetheless, most existing methods rely on the often unrealistic assumption that inputs are always available and fail to capture hidden spatiotemporal dynamics when part of the data is missing. In this work, we tackle this problem through hierarchical spatiotemporal downsampling. The input time series are progressively coarsened over time and space, obtaining a pool of representations that capture heterogeneous temporal and spatial dynamics. Conditioned on observations and missing data patterns, such representations are combined by an interpretable attention mechanism to generate the forecasts. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks under different missing data distributions, particularly in the presence of contiguous blocks of missing values.</description>

      <title>Refining Minimax Regret for Unsupervised Environment Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In unsupervised environment design, reinforcement learning agents are trained on environment configurations (levels) generated by an adversary that maximises some objective. Regret is a commonly used objective that theoretically results in a minimax regret (MMR) policy with desirable robustness guarantees; in particular, the agent's maximum regret is bounded. However, once the agent reaches this regret bound on all levels, the adversary will only sample levels where regret cannot be further reduced. Although there are possible performance improvements to be made outside of these regret-maximising levels, learning stagnates. In this work, we introduce Bayesian level-perfect MMR (BLP), a refinement of the minimax regret objective that overcomes this limitation. We formally show that solving for this objective results in a subset of MMR policies, and that BLP policies act consistently with a Perfect Bayesian policy over all levels. We further introduce an algorithm, ReMiDi, that results in a BLP policy at convergence. We empirically demonstrate that training on levels from a minimax regret adversary causes learning to prematurely stagnate, but that ReMiDi continues learning.</description>

      <title>GTBench: Uncovering the Strategic Reasoning Limitations of LLMs via Game-Theoretic Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applications, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial. This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents. We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios. Then, we (1) Characterize the game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; and (2) Perform LLM-vs.-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation. We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Most open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct and Llama-2-70b-chat, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games, yet the recently released Llama-3-70b-Instruct makes up for this shortcoming. In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. We further characterize the game-theoretic properties of LLMs, such as equilibrium and Pareto Efficiency in repeated games. Detailed error profiles are provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior. We hope our research provides standardized protocols and serves as a foundation to spur further explorations in the strategic reasoning of LLMs.</description>

      <title>CounterCurate: Enhancing Physical and Semantic Visio-Linguistic Compositional Reasoning via Counterfactual Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose CounterCurate, a framework to comprehensively improve the visio-linguistic compositional reasoning capability for both contrastive and generative multimodal models. In particular, we identify two critical under-explored problems: the neglect of the physically grounded reasoning (counting and position understanding) and the potential of using highly capable text and image generation models for semantic counterfactual fine-tuning. Our work pioneers an approach that addresses these gaps. We first spotlight the near-chance performance of multimodal models like CLIP and LLaVA in physically grounded compositional reasoning. We then apply simple data augmentation using grounded image generation model GLIGEN to generate fine-tuning data, resulting in significant performance improvements: +33% and +37% for CLIP and LLaVA, respectively, on our newly curated Flickr30k-Positions benchmark. Moreover, we exploit the capabilities of high-performing text generation and image generation models, specifically GPT-4V and DALLE-3, to curate challenging semantic counterfactuals, thereby further enhancing compositional reasoning capabilities on benchmarks such as SugarCrepe, where CounterCurate outperforms GPT-4V. To facilitate future research, we release our code, dataset, benchmark, and checkpoints at https://countercurate.github.io.</description>

      <title>Ranking Large Language Models without Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14860v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluation and ranking of large language models (LLMs) has become an important problem with the proliferation of these models and their impact. Evaluation methods either require human responses which are expensive to acquire or use pairs of LLMs to evaluate each other which can be unreliable. In this paper, we provide a novel perspective where, given a dataset of prompts (viz. questions, instructions, etc.) and a set of LLMs, we rank them without access to any ground truth or reference responses. Inspired by real life where both an expert and a knowledgeable person can identify a novice our main idea is to consider triplets of models, where each one of them evaluates the other two, correctly identifying the worst model in the triplet with high probability. We also analyze our idea and provide sufficient conditions for it to succeed. Applying this idea repeatedly, we propose two methods to rank LLMs. In experiments on different generative tasks (summarization, multiple-choice, and dialog), our methods reliably recover close to true rankings without reference data. This points to a viable low-resource mechanism for practical use.</description>

      <title>Introducing GenCeption for Multimodal LLM Benchmarking: You May Bypass Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly evaluated using costly annotated multimodal benchmarks. However, these benchmarks often struggle to keep pace with the rapidly advancing requirements of MLLM evaluation. We propose GenCeption, a novel and annotation-free MLLM evaluation framework that merely requires unimodal data to assess inter-modality semantic coherence and inversely reflects the models' inclination to hallucinate. Analogous to the popular DrawCeption game, GenCeption initiates with a non-textual sample and undergoes a series of iterative description and generation steps. Semantic drift across iterations is quantified using the GC@T metric. Our empirical findings validate GenCeption's efficacy, showing strong correlations with popular MLLM benchmarking results. GenCeption may be extended to mitigate training data contamination by utilizing ubiquitous, previously unseen unimodal data.</description>

      <title>How Important Is Tokenization in French Medical Masked Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subword tokenization has become the prevailing standard in the field of natural language processing (NLP) over recent years, primarily due to the widespread utilization of pre-trained language models. This shift began with Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and was later followed by the adoption of SentencePiece and WordPiece. While subword tokenization consistently outperforms character and word-level tokenization, the precise factors contributing to its success remain unclear. Key aspects such as the optimal segmentation granularity for diverse tasks and languages, the influence of data sources on tokenizers, and the role of morphological information in Indo-European languages remain insufficiently explored. This is particularly pertinent for biomedical terminology, characterized by specific rules governing morpheme combinations. Despite the agglutinative nature of biomedical terminology, existing language models do not explicitly incorporate this knowledge, leading to inconsistent tokenization strategies for common terms. In this paper, we seek to delve into the complexities of subword tokenization in French biomedical domain across a variety of NLP tasks and pinpoint areas where further enhancements can be made. We analyze classical tokenization algorithms, including BPE and SentencePiece, and introduce an original tokenization strategy that integrates morpheme-enriched word segmentation into existing tokenization methods.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators with Localized Integral and Differential Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators learn mappings between function spaces, which is practical for learning solution operators of PDEs and other scientific modeling applications. Among them, the Fourier neural operator (FNO) is a popular architecture that performs global convolutions in the Fourier space. However, such global operations are often prone to over-smoothing and may fail to capture local details. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can capture local features but are limited to training and inference at a single resolution. In this work, we present a principled approach to operator learning that can capture local features under two frameworks by learning differential operators and integral operators with locally supported kernels. Specifically, inspired by stencil methods, we prove that we obtain differential operators under an appropriate scaling of the kernel values of CNNs. To obtain local integral operators, we utilize suitable basis representations for the kernels based on discrete-continuous convolutions. Both these approaches preserve the properties of operator learning and, hence, the ability to predict at any resolution. Adding our layers to FNOs significantly improves their performance, reducing the relative L2-error by 34-72% in our experiments, which include a turbulent 2D Navier-Stokes and the spherical shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs Capable of Data-based Statistical and Causal Reasoning? Benchmarking Advanced Quantitative Reasoning with Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative reasoning is a critical skill to analyze data, yet the assessment of such ability remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce the Quantitative Reasoning with Data (QRData) benchmark, aiming to evaluate Large Language Models' capability in statistical and causal reasoning with real-world data. The benchmark comprises a carefully constructed dataset of 411 questions accompanied by data sheets from textbooks, online learning materials, and academic papers. To compare models' quantitative reasoning abilities on data and text, we enrich the benchmark with an auxiliary set of 290 text-only questions, namely QRText. We evaluate natural language reasoning, program-based reasoning, and agent reasoning methods including Chain-of-Thought, Program-of-Thoughts, ReAct, and code interpreter assistants on diverse models. The strongest model GPT-4 achieves an accuracy of 58%, which has much room for improvement. Among open-source models, Deepseek-coder-instruct, a code LLM pretrained on 2T tokens, gets the highest accuracy of 37%. Analysis reveals that models encounter difficulties in data analysis and causal reasoning, and struggle in using causal knowledge and provided data simultaneously. Code and data are in https://github.com/xxxiaol/QRData.</description>

      <title>When Your AIs Deceive You: Challenges of Partial Observability in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Past analyses of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) assume that the human evaluators fully observe the environment. What happens when human feedback is based only on partial observations? We formally define two failure cases: deceptive inflation and overjustification. Modeling the human as Boltzmann-rational w.r.t. a belief over trajectories, we prove conditions under which RLHF is guaranteed to result in policies that deceptively inflate their performance, overjustify their behavior to make an impression, or both. Under the new assumption that the human's partial observability is known and accounted for, we then analyze how much information the feedback process provides about the return function. We show that sometimes, the human's feedback determines the return function uniquely up to an additive constant, but in other realistic cases, there is irreducible ambiguity. We propose exploratory research directions to help tackle these challenges and caution against blindly applying RLHF in partially observable settings.</description>

      <title>Making Them Ask and Answer: Jailbreaking Large Language Models in Few Queries via Disguise and Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable success across various tasks, but the trustworthiness of LLMs is still an open problem. One specific threat is the potential to generate toxic or harmful responses. Attackers can craft adversarial prompts that induce harmful responses from LLMs. In this work, we pioneer a theoretical foundation in LLMs security by identifying bias vulnerabilities within the safety fine-tuning and design a black-box jailbreak method named DRA (Disguise and Reconstruction Attack), which conceals harmful instructions through disguise and prompts the model to reconstruct the original harmful instruction within its completion. We evaluate DRA across various open-source and closed-source models, showcasing state-of-the-art jailbreak success rates and attack efficiency. Notably, DRA boasts a 91.1% attack success rate on OpenAI GPT-4 chatbot.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Domain Generalization in Dynamical Systems Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In science we are interested in finding the governing equations, the dynamical rules, underlying empirical phenomena. While traditionally scientific models are derived through cycles of human insight and experimentation, recently deep learning (DL) techniques have been advanced to reconstruct dynamical systems (DS) directly from time series data. State-of-the-art dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) methods show promise in capturing invariant and long-term properties of observed DS, but their ability to generalize to unobserved domains remains an open challenge. Yet, this is a crucial property we would expect from any viable scientific theory. In this work, we provide a formal framework that addresses generalization in DSR. We explain why and how out-of-domain (OOD) generalization (OODG) in DSR profoundly differs from OODG considered elsewhere in machine learning. We introduce mathematical notions based on topological concepts and ergodic theory to formalize the idea of learnability of a DSR model. We formally prove that black-box DL techniques, without adequate structural priors, generally will not be able to learn a generalizing DSR model. We also show this empirically, considering major classes of DSR algorithms proposed so far, and illustrate where and why they fail to generalize across the whole phase space. Our study provides the first comprehensive mathematical treatment of OODG in DSR, and gives a deeper conceptual understanding of where the fundamental problems in OODG lie and how they could possibly be addressed in practice.</description>

      <title>Training Dynamics of Multi-Head Softmax Attention for In-Context Learning: Emergence, Convergence, and Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gradient flow for training a multi-head softmax attention model for in-context learning of multi-task linear regression. We establish the global convergence of gradient flow under suitable choices of initialization. In addition, we prove that an interesting "task allocation" phenomenon emerges during the gradient flow dynamics, where each attention head focuses on solving a single task of the multi-task model. Specifically, we prove that the gradient flow dynamics can be split into three phases -- a warm-up phase where the loss decreases rather slowly and the attention heads gradually build up their inclination towards individual tasks, an emergence phase where each head selects a single task and the loss rapidly decreases, and a convergence phase where the attention parameters converge to a limit. Furthermore, we prove the optimality of gradient flow in the sense that the limiting model learned by gradient flow is on par with the best possible multi-head softmax attention model up to a constant factor. Our analysis also delineates a strict separation in terms of the prediction accuracy of ICL between single-head and multi-head attention models. The key technique for our convergence analysis is to map the gradient flow dynamics in the parameter space to a set of ordinary differential equations in the spectral domain, where the relative magnitudes of the semi-singular values of the attention weights determines task allocation. To our best knowledge, our work provides the first convergence result for the multi-head softmax attention model.</description>

      <title>Resonance RoPE: Improving Context Length Generalization of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of train-short-test-long (TSTL) scenarios in Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), where models pre-trained on shorter sequences face difficulty with out-of-distribution (OOD) token positions in longer sequences. We introduce Resonance RoPE, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios by refining the interpolation of RoPE features for OOD positions, significantly improving the model performance without additional online computational costs. Furthermore, we present PosGen, a new synthetic benchmark specifically designed for fine-grained behavior analysis in TSTL scenarios, aiming to isolate the constantly increasing difficulty of token generation on long contexts from the challenges of recognizing new token positions. Our experiments on synthetic tasks show that after applying Resonance RoPE, Transformers recognize OOD position better and more robustly. Our extensive LLM experiments also show superior performance after applying Resonance RoPE to the current state-of-the-art RoPE scaling method, YaRN, on both upstream language modeling tasks and a variety of downstream long-text applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in interpreting multi-modal contexts, they invariably suffer from object hallucinations (OH). We introduce HALC, a novel decoding algorithm designed to mitigate OH in LVLMs. HALC leverages distinct fine-grained optimal visual information in vision-language tasks and operates on both local and global contexts simultaneously. Specifically, HALC integrates a robust auto-focal grounding mechanism (locally) to correct hallucinated tokens on the fly, and a specialized beam search algorithm (globally) to significantly reduce OH while preserving text generation quality. Additionally, HALC can be integrated into any LVLMs as a plug-and-play module without extra training. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HALC in reducing OH, outperforming state-of-the-arts across four benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Learning to Maximize Mutual Information for Chain-of-Thought Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation, the technique of transferring knowledge from large, complex models to smaller ones, marks a pivotal step towards efficient AI deployment. Distilling Step-by-Step~(DSS), a novel method utilizing chain-of-thought~(CoT) distillation, has demonstrated promise by imbuing smaller models with the superior reasoning capabilities of their larger counterparts. In DSS, the distilled model acquires the ability to generate rationales and predict labels concurrently through a multi-task learning framework. However, DSS overlooks the intrinsic relationship between the two training tasks, leading to ineffective integration of CoT knowledge with the task of label prediction. To this end, we investigate the mutual relationship of the two tasks from Information Bottleneck perspective and formulate it as maximizing the mutual information of the representation features of the two tasks. We propose a variational approach to solve this optimization problem using a learning-based method. Our experimental results across four datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art DSS. Our findings offer insightful guidance for future research on language model distillation as well as applications involving CoT.

      <title>Unsupervised Real-Time Hallucination Detection based on the Internal States of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) refer to the phenomenon of LLMs producing responses that are coherent yet factually inaccurate. This issue undermines the effectiveness of LLMs in practical applications, necessitating research into detecting and mitigating hallucinations of LLMs. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on post-processing techniques for hallucination detection, which tend to be computationally intensive and limited in effectiveness due to their separation from the LLM's inference process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MIND, an unsupervised training framework that leverages the internal states of LLMs for real-time hallucination detection without requiring manual annotations. Additionally, we present HELM, a new benchmark for evaluating hallucination detection across multiple LLMs, featuring diverse LLM outputs and the internal states of LLMs during their inference process. Our experiments demonstrate that MIND outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in hallucination detection.</description>

      <title>Guiding Clinical Reasoning with Large Language Models via Knowledge Seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical reasoning refers to the cognitive process that physicians employ in evaluating and managing patients. This process typically involves suggesting necessary examinations, diagnosing patients' diseases, and deciding on appropriate therapies, etc. Accurate clinical reasoning requires extensive medical knowledge and rich clinical experience, setting a high bar for physicians. This is particularly challenging in developing countries due to the overwhelming number of patients and limited physician resources, contributing significantly to global health inequity and necessitating automated clinical reasoning approaches. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have demonstrated their potential in clinical reasoning. However, these LLMs are prone to hallucination problems, and the reasoning process of LLMs may not align with the clinical decision path of physicians. In this study, we introduce a novel framework, In-Context Padding (ICP), designed to enhance LLMs with medical knowledge. Specifically, we infer critical clinical reasoning elements (referred to as knowledge seeds) and use these as anchors to guide the generation process of LLMs. Experiments on two clinical question datasets demonstrate that ICP significantly improves the clinical reasoning ability of LLMs.</description>

      <title>CodeAttack: Revealing Safety Generalization Challenges of Large Language Models via Code Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought about remarkable generative capabilities but also raised concerns about their potential misuse. While strategies like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback have enhanced their safety, these methods primarily focus on natural languages, which may not generalize to other domains. This paper introduces CodeAttack, a framework that transforms natural language inputs into code inputs, presenting a novel environment for testing the safety generalization of LLMs. Our comprehensive studies on state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-2, and Llama-2 series reveal a new and universal safety vulnerability of these models against code input: CodeAttack bypasses the safety guardrails of all models more than 80\% of the time. We find that a larger distribution gap between CodeAttack and natural language leads to weaker safety generalization, such as encoding natural language input with data structures. Furthermore, we give our hypotheses about the success of CodeAttack: the misaligned bias acquired by LLMs during code training, prioritizing code completion over avoiding the potential safety risk. Finally, we analyze potential mitigation measures. These findings highlight new safety risks in the code domain and the need for more robust safety alignment algorithms to match the code capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Do Deep Neural Network Solutions Form a Star Domain?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been conjectured that neural network solution sets reachable via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are convex, considering permutation invariances (Entezari et al., 2022). This means that a linear path can connect two independent solutions with low loss, given the weights of one of the models are appropriately permuted. However, current methods to test this theory often require very wide networks to succeed. In this work, we conjecture that more generally, the SGD solution set is a "star domain" that contains a "star model" that is linearly connected to all the other solutions via paths with low loss values, modulo permutations. We propose the Starlight algorithm that finds a star model of a given learning task. We validate our claim by showing that this star model is linearly connected with other independently found solutions. As an additional benefit of our study, we demonstrate better uncertainty estimates on the Bayesian Model Averaging over the obtained star domain. Further, we demonstrate star models as potential substitutes for model ensembles. Our code is available at https://github.com/aktsonthalia/starlight.</description>

      <title>HeadEvolver: Text to Head Avatars via Expressive and Attribute-Preserving Mesh Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present HeadEvolver, a novel framework to generate stylized head avatars from text guidance. HeadEvolver uses locally learnable mesh deformation from a template head mesh, producing high-quality digital assets for detail-preserving editing and animation. To tackle the challenges of lacking fine-grained and semantic-aware local shape control in global deformation through Jacobians, we introduce a trainable parameter as a weighting factor for the Jacobian at each triangle to adaptively change local shapes while maintaining global correspondences and facial features. Moreover, to ensure the coherence of the resulting shape and appearance from different viewpoints, we use pretrained image diffusion models for differentiable rendering with regularization terms to refine the deformation under text guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate diverse head avatars with an articulated mesh that can be edited seamlessly in 3D graphics software, facilitating downstream applications such as more efficient animation with inherited blend shapes and semantic consistency.</description>

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for low-resource languages is still a challenging task in front of NLP researchers. In this work, we deploy a standard data augmentation methodology by back-translation to a new language translation direction Cantonese-to-English. We present the models we fine-tuned using the limited amount of real data and the synthetic data we generated using back-translation including OpusMT, NLLB, and mBART. We carried out automatic evaluation using a range of different metrics including lexical-based and embedding-based. Furthermore. we create a user-friendly interface for the models we included in this\textsc{ CantonMT} research project and make it available to facilitate Cantonese-to-English MT research. Researchers can add more models into this platform via our open-source\textsc{ CantonMT} toolkit \url{https://github.com/kenrickkung/CantoneseTranslation}.</description>

      <title>Interpretable User Satisfaction Estimation for Conversational Systems with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and interpretable user satisfaction estimation (USE) is critical for understanding, evaluating, and continuously improving conversational systems. Users express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with diverse conversational patterns in both general-purpose (ChatGPT and Bing Copilot) and task-oriented (customer service chatbot) conversational systems. Existing approaches based on featurized ML models or text embeddings fall short in extracting generalizable patterns and are hard to interpret. In this work, we show that LLMs can extract interpretable signals of user satisfaction from their natural language utterances more effectively than embedding-based approaches. Moreover, an LLM can be tailored for USE via an iterative prompting framework using supervision from labeled examples. The resulting method, Supervised Prompting for User satisfaction Rubrics (SPUR), not only has higher accuracy but is more interpretable as it scores user satisfaction via learned rubrics with a detailed breakdown.</description>

      <title>Learning to Infer Generative Template Programs for Visual Concepts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People grasp flexible visual concepts from a few examples. We explore a neurosymbolic system that learns how to infer programs that capture visual concepts in a domain-general fashion. We introduce Template Programs: programmatic expressions from a domain-specific language that specify structural and parametric patterns common to an input concept. Our framework supports multiple concept-related tasks, including few-shot generation and co-segmentation through parsing. We develop a learning paradigm that allows us to train networks that infer Template Programs directly from visual datasets that contain concept groupings. We run experiments across multiple visual domains: 2D layouts, Omniglot characters, and 3D shapes. We find that our method outperforms task-specific alternatives, and performs competitively against domain-specific approaches for the limited domains where they exist.</description>

      <title>Towards a RAG-based Summarization Agent for the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity and sheer volume of information encompassing documents, papers, data, and other resources from large-scale experiments demand significant time and effort to navigate, making the task of accessing and utilizing these varied forms of information daunting, particularly for new collaborators and early-career scientists. To tackle this issue, a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)--based Summarization AI for EIC (RAGS4EIC) is under development. This AI-Agent not only condenses information but also effectively references relevant responses, offering substantial advantages for collaborators. Our project involves a two-step approach: first, querying a comprehensive vector database containing all pertinent experiment information; second, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise summaries enriched with citations based on user queries and retrieved data. We describe the evaluation methods that use RAG assessments (RAGAs) scoring mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of responses. Furthermore, we describe the concept of prompt template-based instruction-tuning which provides flexibility and accuracy in summarization. Importantly, the implementation relies on LangChain, which serves as the foundation of our entire workflow. This integration ensures efficiency and scalability, facilitating smooth deployment and accessibility for various user groups within the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) community. This innovative AI-driven framework not only simplifies the understanding of vast datasets but also encourages collaborative participation, thereby empowering researchers. As a demonstration, a web application has been developed to explain each stage of the RAG Agent development in detail.</description>

      <title>FusionINN: Decomposable Image Fusion for Brain Tumor Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image fusion typically employs non-invertible neural networks to merge multiple source images into a single fused image. However, for clinical experts, solely relying on fused images may be insufficient for making diagnostic decisions, as the fusion mechanism blends features from source images, thereby making it difficult to interpret the underlying tumor pathology. We introduce FusionINN, a novel decomposable image fusion framework, capable of efficiently generating fused images and also decomposing them back to the source images. FusionINN is designed to be bijective by including a latent image alongside the fused image, while ensuring minimal transfer of information from the source images to the latent representation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the decomposability of fused images, which is particularly crucial for life-sensitive applications such as medical image fusion compared to other tasks like multi-focus or multi-exposure image fusion. Our extensive experimentation validates FusionINN over existing discriminative and generative fusion methods, both subjectively and objectively. Moreover, compared to a recent denoising diffusion-based fusion model, our approach offers faster and qualitatively better fusion results.</description>

      <title>A Study in Dataset Pruning for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In image Super-Resolution (SR), relying on large datasets for training is a double-edged sword. While offering rich training material, they also demand substantial computational and storage resources. In this work, we analyze dataset pruning to solve these challenges. We introduce a novel approach that reduces a dataset to a core-set of training samples, selected based on their loss values as determined by a simple pre-trained SR model. By focusing the training on just 50\% of the original dataset, specifically on the samples characterized by the highest loss values, we achieve results comparable to or surpassing those obtained from training on the entire dataset. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that the top 5\% of samples with the highest loss values negatively affect the training process. Excluding these samples and adjusting the selection to favor easier samples further enhances training outcomes. Our work opens new perspectives to the untapped potential of dataset pruning in image SR. It suggests that careful selection of training data based on loss-value metrics can lead to better SR models, challenging the conventional wisdom that more data inevitably leads to better performance.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Bias in Large Vision-Language Models with Counterfactuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) possessing increasingly impressive capabilities, a number of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed to augment LLMs with visual inputs. Such models condition generated text on both an input image and a text prompt, enabling a variety of use cases such as visual question answering and multimodal chat. While prior studies have examined the social biases contained in text generated by LLMs, this topic has been relatively unexplored in LVLMs. Examining social biases in LVLMs is particularly challenging due to the confounding contributions of bias induced by information contained across the text and visual modalities. To address this challenging problem, we conduct a large-scale study of text generated by different LVLMs under counterfactual changes to input images. Specifically, we present LVLMs with identical open-ended text prompts while conditioning on images from different counterfactual sets, where each set contains images which are largely identical in their depiction of a common subject (e.g., a doctor), but vary only in terms of intersectional social attributes (e.g., race and gender). We comprehensively evaluate the text produced by different LVLMs under this counterfactual generation setting and find that social attributes such as race, gender, and physical characteristics depicted in input images can significantly influence toxicity and the generation of competency-associated words.</description>

      <title>Visual Autoregressive Modeling: Scalable Image Generation via Next-Scale Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR), a new generation paradigm that redefines the autoregressive learning on images as coarse-to-fine "next-scale prediction" or "next-resolution prediction", diverging from the standard raster-scan "next-token prediction". This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and generalize well: VAR, for the first time, makes GPT-like AR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation. On ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VAR significantly improve AR baseline by improving Frechet inception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.73, inception score (IS) from 80.4 to 350.2, with around 20x faster inference speed. It is also empirically verified that VAR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in multiple dimensions including image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability. Scaling up VAR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to those observed in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near -0.998 as solid evidence. VAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstream tasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. These results suggest VAR has initially emulated the two important properties of LLMs: Scaling Laws and zero-shot task generalization. We have released all models and codes to promote the exploration of AR/VAR models for visual generation and unified learning.</description>

      <title>player2vec: A Language Modeling Approach to Understand Player Behavior in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods for learning latent user representations from historical behavior logs have gained traction for recommendation tasks in e-commerce, content streaming, and other settings. However, this area still remains relatively underexplored in video and mobile gaming contexts. In this work, we present a novel method for overcoming this limitation by extending a long-range Transformer model from the natural language processing domain to player behavior data. We discuss specifics of behavior tracking in games and propose preprocessing and tokenization approaches by viewing in-game events in an analogous way to words in sentences, thus enabling learning player representations in a self-supervised manner in the absence of ground-truth annotations. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in fitting the distribution of behavior events by evaluating intrinsic language modeling metrics. Furthermore, we qualitatively analyze the emerging structure of the learned embedding space and show its value for generating insights into behavior patterns to inform downstream applications.</description>

      <title>ClashEval: Quantifying the tug-of-war between an LLM's internal prior and external evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10198</link>

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is frequently used to mitigate hallucinations and provide up-to-date knowledge for large language models (LLMs). However, given that document retrieval is an imprecise task and sometimes results in erroneous or even harmful content being presented in context, this raises the question of how LLMs handle retrieved information: If the provided content is incorrect, does the model know to ignore it, or does it recapitulate the error? Conversely, when the model's initial response is incorrect, does it always know to use the retrieved information to correct itself, or does it insist on its wrong prior response? To answer this, we curate a dataset of over 1200 questions across six domains (e.g., drug dosages, Olympic records, locations) along with content relevant to answering each question. We further apply precise perturbations to the answers in the content that range from subtle to blatant errors. We benchmark six top-performing LLMs, including GPT-4o, on this dataset and find that LLMs are susceptible to adopting incorrect retrieved content, overriding their own correct prior knowledge over 60% of the time. However, the more unrealistic the retrieved content is (i.e. more deviated from truth), the less likely the model is to adopt it. Also, the less confident a model is in its initial response (via measuring token probabilities), the more likely it is to adopt the information in the retrieved content. We exploit this finding and demonstrate simple methods for improving model accuracy where there is conflicting retrieved content. Our results highlight a difficult task and benchmark for LLMs -- namely, their ability to correctly discern when it is wrong in light of correct retrieved content and to reject cases when the provided content is incorrect.</description>

      <title>Generating Diverse Criteria On-the-Fly to Improve Point-wise LLM Rankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most recent pointwise Large Language Model (LLM) rankers have achieved remarkable ranking results. However, these rankers are hindered by two major drawbacks: (1) they fail to follow a standardized comparison guidance during the ranking process, and (2) they struggle with comprehensive considerations when dealing with complicated passages. To address these shortcomings, we propose to build a ranker that generates ranking scores based on a set of criteria from various perspectives. These criteria are intended to direct each perspective in providing a distinct yet synergistic evaluation. Our research, which examines eight datasets from the BEIR benchmark demonstrates that incorporating this multi-perspective criteria ensemble approach markedly enhanced the performance of pointwise LLM rankers.</description>

      <title>How to Benchmark Vision Foundation Models for Semantic Segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated proficiency in various tasks but require supervised fine-tuning to perform the task of semantic segmentation effectively. Benchmarking their performance is essential for selecting current models and guiding future model developments for this task. The lack of a standardized benchmark complicates comparisons. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to study how VFMs should be benchmarked for semantic segmentation. To do so, various VFMs are fine-tuned under various settings, and the impact of individual settings on the performance ranking and training time is assessed. Based on the results, the recommendation is to fine-tune the ViT-B variants of VFMs with a 16x16 patch size and a linear decoder, as these settings are representative of using a larger model, more advanced decoder and smaller patch size, while reducing training time by more than 13 times. Using multiple datasets for training and evaluation is also recommended, as the performance ranking across datasets and domain shifts varies. Linear probing, a common practice for some VFMs, is not recommended, as it is not representative of end-to-end fine-tuning. The benchmarking setup recommended in this paper enables a performance analysis of VFMs for semantic segmentation. The findings of such an analysis reveal that pretraining with promptable segmentation is not beneficial, whereas masked image modeling (MIM) with abstract representations is crucial, even more important than the type of supervision used. The code for efficiently fine-tuning VFMs for semantic segmentation can be accessed through the project page at: https://tue-mps.github.io/benchmark-vfm-ss/.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Efficient Inference for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted extensive attention due to their remarkable performance across various tasks. However, the substantial computational and memory requirements of LLM inference pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios. Efforts within the field have been directed towards developing techniques aimed at enhancing the efficiency of LLM inference. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on efficient LLM inference. We start by analyzing the primary causes of the inefficient LLM inference, i.e., the large model size, the quadratic-complexity attention operation, and the auto-regressive decoding approach. Then, we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the current literature into data-level, model-level, and system-level optimization. Moreover, the paper includes comparative experiments on representative methods within critical sub-fields to provide quantitative insights. Last but not least, we provide some knowledge summary and discuss future research directions.</description>

      <title>Aligning LLM Agents by Learning Latent Preference from User Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study interactive learning of LLM-based language agents based on user edits made to the agent's output. In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness. The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time. We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data. The inferred user preference descriptions are used to define prompts for generating responses in the future. This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks. Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference. However, user preference can be complex, subtle, and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages the LLM to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits. In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation. We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, and use a GPT-4 simulated user for evaluation. On both tasks, CIPHER outperforms several baselines by achieving the lowest edit distance cost while only having a small overhead in LLM query cost. Our analysis reports that user preferences learned by CIPHER show significant similarity to the ground truth latent preferences.</description>

      <title>Constructive Interpolation and Concept-Based Beth Definability for Description Logics via Sequents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive method applicable to a large number of description logics (DLs) for establishing the concept-based Beth definability property (CBP) based on sequent systems. Using the highly expressive DL RIQ as a case study, we introduce novel sequent calculi for RIQ-ontologies and show how certain interpolants can be computed from sequent calculus proofs, which permit the extraction of explicit definitions of implicitly definable concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sequent-based approach to computing interpolants and definitions within the context of DLs, as well as the first proof that RIQ enjoys the CBP. Moreover, due to the modularity of our sequent systems, our results hold for any restriction of RIQ, and are applicable to other DLs by suitable modifications.</description>

      <title>Do Vision &amp; Language Decoders use Images and Text equally? How Self-consistent are their Explanations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision and language model (VLM) decoders are currently the best-performing architectures on multimodal tasks. Next to predictions, they can also produce explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear how much they use the vision and text modalities when generating predictions or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to providing answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. Moreover, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for explanation generation compared to answer generation. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before only covered VL encoders. We find that VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE.</description>

      <title>M3H: Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing an integrated many-to-many framework leveraging multimodal data for multiple tasks is crucial to unifying healthcare applications ranging from diagnoses to operations. In resource-constrained hospital environments, a scalable and unified machine learning framework that improves previous forecast performances could improve hospital operations and save costs. We introduce M3H, an explainable Multimodal Multitask Machine Learning for Healthcare framework that consolidates learning from tabular, time-series, language, and vision data for supervised binary/multiclass classification, regression, and unsupervised clustering. It features a novel attention mechanism balancing self-exploitation (learning source-task), and cross-exploration (learning cross-tasks), and offers explainability through a proposed TIM score, shedding light on the dynamics of task learning interdependencies. M3H encompasses an unprecedented range of medical tasks and machine learning problem classes and consistently outperforms traditional single-task models by on average 11.6% across 40 disease diagnoses from 16 medical departments, three hospital operation forecasts, and one patient phenotyping task. The modular design of the framework ensures its generalizability in data processing, task definition, and rapid model prototyping, making it production ready for both clinical and operational healthcare settings, especially those in constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Adapting Open-Source Large Language Models for Cost-Effective, Expert-Level Clinical Note Generation with On-Policy Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00715v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Gemini have demonstrated promising capabilities in clinical text summarization tasks. However, due to patient data privacy concerns and computational costs, many healthcare providers prefer using small, locally-hosted models over external generic LLMs. This study presents a comprehensive domain- and task-specific adaptation process for the open-source LLaMA-2 13 billion parameter model, enabling it to generate high-quality clinical notes from outpatient patient-doctor dialogues. Our process incorporates continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from both AI and human feedback. We introduced a new approach, DistillDirect, for performing on-policy reinforcement learning with Gemini 1.0 Pro as the teacher model. Our resulting model, LLaMA-Clinic, can generate clinical notes comparable in quality to those authored by physicians. In a blinded physician reader study, the majority (90.4%) of individual evaluations rated the notes generated by LLaMA-Clinic as "acceptable" or higher across all three criteria: real-world readiness, completeness, and accuracy. In the more challenging "Assessment and Plan" section, LLaMA-Clinic scored higher (4.2/5) in real-world readiness than physician-authored notes (4.1/5). Our cost analysis for inference shows that our LLaMA-Clinic model achieves a 3.75-fold cost reduction compared to an external generic LLM service. Additionally, we highlight key considerations for future clinical note-generation tasks, emphasizing the importance of pre-defining a best-practice note format, rather than relying on LLMs to determine this for clinical practice. We have made our newly created synthetic clinic dialogue-note dataset and the physician feedback dataset publicly available to foster future research.</description>

      <title>Active Neural 3D Reconstruction with Colorized Surface Voxel-based View Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active view selection in 3D scene reconstruction has been widely studied since training on informative views is critical for reconstruction. Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) variants have shown promising results in active 3D reconstruction using uncertainty-guided view selection. They utilize uncertainties estimated with neural networks that encode scene geometry and appearance. However, the choice of uncertainty integration methods, either voxel-based or neural rendering, has conventionally depended on the types of scene uncertainty being estimated, whether geometric or appearance-related. In this paper, we introduce Colorized Surface Voxel (CSV)-based view selection, a new next-best view (NBV) selection method exploiting surface voxel-based measurement of uncertainty in scene appearance. CSV encapsulates the uncertainty of estimated scene appearance (e.g., color uncertainty) and estimated geometric information (e.g., surface). Using the geometry information, we interpret the uncertainty of scene appearance 3D-wise during the aggregation of the per-voxel uncertainty. Consequently, the uncertainty from occluded and complex regions is recognized under challenging scenarios with limited input data. Our method outperforms previous works on popular datasets, DTU and Blender, and our new dataset with imbalanced viewpoints, showing that the CSV-based view selection significantly improves performance by up to 30%.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Reinforcement Learning of Curative Curtailment with Partial Measurement Availability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the course of the energy transition, the expansion of generation and consumption will change, and many of these technologies, such as PV systems, electric cars and heat pumps, will influence the power flow, especially in the distribution grids. Scalable methods that can make decisions for each grid connection are needed to enable congestion-free grid operation in the distribution grids. This paper presents a novel end-to-end approach to resolving congestion in distribution grids with deep reinforcement learning. Our architecture learns to curtail power and set appropriate reactive power to determine a non-congested and, thus, feasible grid state. State-of-the-art methods such as the optimal power flow (OPF) demand high computational costs and detailed measurements of every bus in a grid. In contrast, the presented method enables decisions under sparse information with just some buses observable in the grid. Distribution grids are generally not yet fully digitized and observable, so this method can be used for decision-making on the majority of low-voltage grids. On a real low-voltage grid the approach resolves 100\% of violations in the voltage band and 98.8\% of asset overloads. The results show that decisions can also be made on real grids that guarantee sufficient quality for congestion-free grid operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work critically analyzes existing models for open-vocabulary EEG-to-Text translation. We identify a crucial limitation: previous studies often employed implicit teacher-forcing during evaluation, artificially inflating performance metrics. Additionally, they lacked a critical benchmark - comparing model performance on pure noise inputs. We propose a methodology to differentiate between models that truly learn from EEG signals and those that simply memorize training data. Our analysis reveals that model performance on noise data can be comparable to that on EEG data. These findings highlight the need for stricter evaluation practices in EEG-to-Text research, emphasizing transparent reporting and rigorous benchmarking with noise inputs. This approach will lead to more reliable assessments of model capabilities and pave the way for robust EEG-to-Text communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the zero-shot ability of GPT-4 and LLaVa to perform simple Visual Network Analysis (VNA) tasks on small-scale graphs. We evaluate the Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 5 tasks related to three foundational network science concepts: identifying nodes of maximal degree on a rendered graph, identifying whether signed triads are balanced or unbalanced, and counting components. The tasks are structured to be easy for a human who understands the underlying graph theoretic concepts, and can all be solved by counting the appropriate elements in graphs. We find that while GPT-4 consistently outperforms LLaVa, both models struggle with every visual network analysis task we propose. We publicly release the first benchmark for the evaluation of VLMs on foundational VNA tasks.</description>

      <title>FreeVA: Offline MLLM as Training-Free Video Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper undertakes an empirical study to revisit the latest advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): Video Assistant. This study, namely FreeVA, aims to extend existing image-based MLLM to the video domain in a training-free manner. The study provides an essential, yet must-know baseline, and reveals several surprising findings: 1) FreeVA, leveraging only offline image-based MLLM without additional training, excels in zero-shot video question-answering (e.g., MSVD-QA, ActivityNet-QA, and MSRVTT-QA), even surpassing state-of-the-art methods that involve video instruction tuning. 2) While mainstream video-based MLLMs typically initialize with an image-based MLLM (e.g., LLaVA) and then fine-tune using video instruction tuning, the study indicates that utilizing the widely adopted VideoInstruct-100K for video instruction tuning doesn't actually lead to better performance compared to not training at all. 3) The commonly used evaluation metrics in existing works are significantly influenced by changes in the GPT API version over time. If ignored, this could affect the fairness and uniformity of comparisons between different methods and impact the analysis and judgment of researchers in the field. The advancement of MLLMs is currently thriving, drawing numerous researchers into the field. We aim for this work to serve as a plug-and-play, simple yet effective baseline, encouraging the direct evaluation of existing MLLMs in video domain while also standardizing the field of video conversational models to a certain extent. Also, we encourage researchers to reconsider: Have current video MLLM methods truly acquired knowledge beyond image MLLM? Code is available at https://github.com/whwu95/FreeVA</description>

Abstract: Adaptive Risk Control (ARC) is an online calibration strategy based on set prediction that offers worst-case deterministic long-term risk control, as well as statistical marginal coverage guarantees. ARC adjusts the size of the prediction set by varying a single scalar threshold based on feedback from past decisions. In this work, we introduce Localized Adaptive Risk Control (L-ARC), an online calibration scheme that targets statistical localized risk guarantees ranging from conditional risk to marginal risk, while preserving the worst-case performance of ARC. L-ARC updates a threshold function within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), with the kernel determining the level of localization of the statistical risk guarantee. The theoretical results highlight a trade-off between localization of the statistical risk and convergence speed to the long-term risk target. Thanks to localization, L-ARC is demonstrated via experiments to produce prediction sets with risk guarantees across different data subpopulations, significantly improving the fairness of the calibrated model for tasks such as image segmentation and beam selection in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>CLASSP: a Biologically-Inspired Approach to Continual Learning through Adjustment Suppression and Sparsity Promotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new biologically-inspired training method named Continual Learning through Adjustment Suppression and Sparsity Promotion (CLASSP). CLASSP is based on two main principles observed in neuroscience, particularly in the context of synaptic transmission and Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). The first principle is a decay rate over the weight adjustment, which is implemented as a generalization of the AdaGrad optimization algorithm. This means that weights that have received many updates should have lower learning rates as they likely encode important information about previously seen data. However, this principle results in a diffuse distribution of updates throughout the model, as it promotes updates for weights that haven't been previously updated, while a sparse update distribution is preferred to leave weights unassigned for future tasks. Therefore, the second principle introduces a threshold on the loss gradient. This promotes sparse learning by updating a weight only if the loss gradient with respect to that weight is above a certain threshold, i.e. only updating weights with a significant impact on the current loss. Both principles reflect phenomena observed in LTP, where a threshold effect and a gradual saturation of potentiation have been observed. CLASSP is implemented in a Python/PyTorch class, making it applicable to any model. When compared with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) using Computer Vision and sentiment analysis datasets, CLASSP demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and memory footprint.</description>

      <title>JointRF: End-to-End Joint Optimization for Dynamic Neural Radiance Field Representation and Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) excels in photo-realistically static scenes, inspiring numerous efforts to facilitate volumetric videos. However, rendering dynamic and long-sequence radiance fields remains challenging due to the significant data required to represent volumetric videos. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end joint optimization scheme of dynamic NeRF representation and compression, called JointRF, thus achieving significantly improved quality and compression efficiency against the previous methods. Specifically, JointRF employs a compact residual feature grid and a coefficient feature grid to represent the dynamic NeRF. This representation handles large motions without compromising quality while concurrently diminishing temporal redundancy. We also introduce a sequential feature compression subnetwork to further reduce spatial-temporal redundancy. Finally, the representation and compression subnetworks are end-to-end trained combined within the JointRF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JointRF can achieve superior compression performance across various datasets.</description>

      <title>Semantica: An Adaptable Image-Conditioned Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the task of adapting image generative models to different datasets without finetuneing. To this end, we introduce Semantica, an image-conditioned diffusion model capable of generating images based on the semantics of a conditioning image. Semantica is trained exclusively on web-scale image pairs, that is it receives a random image from a webpage as conditional input and models another random image from the same webpage. Our experiments highlight the expressivity of pretrained image encoders and necessity of semantic-based data filtering in achieving high-quality image generation. Once trained, it can adaptively generate new images from a dataset by simply using images from that dataset as input. We study the transfer properties of Semantica on ImageNet, LSUN Churches, LSUN Bedroom and SUN397.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Visual-Language Modality Alignment in Large Vision Language Models via Self-Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results in various visual question-answering and reasoning tasks through vision instruction tuning on specific datasets. However, there is still significant room for improvement in the alignment between visual and language modalities. Previous methods to enhance this alignment typically require external models or data, heavily depending on their capabilities and quality, which inevitably sets an upper bound on performance. In this paper, we propose SIMA, a framework that enhances visual and language modality alignment through self-improvement, eliminating the needs for external models or data. SIMA leverages prompts from existing vision instruction tuning datasets to self-generate responses and employs an in-context self-critic mechanism to select response pairs for preference tuning. The key innovation is the introduction of three vision metrics during the in-context self-critic process, which can guide the LVLM in selecting responses that enhance image comprehension. Through experiments across 14 hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that SIMA not only improves model performance across all benchmarks but also achieves superior modality alignment, outperforming previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Confidence Under the Hood: An Investigation into the Confidence-Probability Alignment in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16282v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes more widespread, understanding their self-evaluation of confidence in generated responses becomes increasingly important as it is integral to the reliability of the output of these models. We introduce the concept of Confidence-Probability Alignment, that connects an LLM's internal confidence, quantified by token probabilities, to the confidence conveyed in the model's response when explicitly asked about its certainty. Using various datasets and prompting techniques that encourage model introspection, we probe the alignment between models' internal and expressed confidence. These techniques encompass using structured evaluation scales to rate confidence, including answer options when prompting, and eliciting the model's confidence level for outputs it does not recognize as its own. Notably, among the models analyzed, OpenAI's GPT-4 showed the strongest confidence-probability alignment, with an average Spearman's $\hat{\rho}$ of 0.42, across a wide range of tasks. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to facilitate risk assessment in the application of LLMs and to further our understanding of model trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>LLMs for User Interest Exploration in Large-scale Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems are subject to a strong feedback loop by learning from and reinforcing past user-item interactions, which in turn limits the discovery of novel user interests. To address this, we introduce a hybrid hierarchical framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and classic recommendation models for user interest exploration. The framework controls the interfacing between the LLMs and the classic recommendation models through "interest clusters", the granularity of which can be explicitly determined by algorithm designers. It recommends the next novel interests by first representing "interest clusters" using language, and employs a fine-tuned LLM to generate novel interest descriptions that are strictly within these predefined clusters. At the low level, it grounds these generated interests to an item-level policy by restricting classic recommendation models, in this case a transformer-based sequence recommender to return items that fall within the novel clusters generated at the high level. We showcase the efficacy of this approach on an industrial-scale commercial platform serving billions of users. Live experiments show a significant increase in both exploration of novel interests and overall user enjoyment of the platform.</description>

      <title>CPsyCoun: A Report-based Multi-turn Dialogue Reconstruction and Evaluation Framework for Chinese Psychological Counseling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to assist psychological counseling is a significant but challenging task at present. Attempts have been made on improving empathetic conversations or acting as effective assistants in the treatment with LLMs. However, the existing datasets lack consulting knowledge, resulting in LLMs lacking professional consulting competence. Moreover, how to automatically evaluate multi-turn dialogues within the counseling process remains an understudied area. To bridge the gap, we propose CPsyCoun, a report-based multi-turn dialogue reconstruction and evaluation framework for Chinese psychological counseling. To fully exploit psychological counseling reports, a two-phase approach is devised to construct high-quality dialogues while a comprehensive evaluation benchmark is developed for the effective automatic evaluation of multi-turn psychological consultations. Competitive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in psychological counseling. We open-source the datasets and model for future research at https://github.com/CAS-SIAT-XinHai/CPsyCoun</description>

      <title>Efficient multi-prompt evaluation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most popular benchmarks for comparing LLMs rely on a limited set of prompt templates, which may not fully capture the LLMs' abilities and can affect the reproducibility of results on leaderboards. Many recent works empirically verify prompt sensitivity and advocate for changes in LLM evaluation. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the performance distribution across many prompt variants instead of finding a single prompt to evaluate with. We introduce PromptEval, a method for estimating performance across a large set of prompts borrowing strength across prompts and examples to produce accurate estimates under practical evaluation budgets. The resulting distribution can be used to obtain performance quantiles to construct various robust performance metrics (e.g., top 95% quantile or median). We prove that PromptEval consistently estimates the performance distribution and demonstrate its efficacy empirically on three prominent LLM benchmarks: MMLU, BIG-bench Hard, and LMentry. For example, PromptEval can accurately estimate performance quantiles across 100 prompt templates on MMLU with a budget equivalent to two single-prompt evaluations. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/felipemaiapolo/prompt-eval.</description>

      <title>FAIntbench: A Holistic and Precise Benchmark for Bias Evaluation in Text-to-Image Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development and reduced barriers to entry for Text-to-Image (T2I) models have raised concerns about the biases in their outputs, but existing research lacks a holistic definition and evaluation framework of biases, limiting the enhancement of debiasing techniques. To address this issue, we introduce FAIntbench, a holistic and precise benchmark for biases in T2I models. In contrast to existing benchmarks that evaluate bias in limited aspects, FAIntbench evaluate biases from four dimensions: manifestation of bias, visibility of bias, acquired attributes, and protected attributes. We applied FAIntbench to evaluate seven recent large-scale T2I models and conducted human evaluation, whose results demonstrated the effectiveness of FAIntbench in identifying various biases. Our study also revealed new research questions about biases, including the side-effect of distillation. The findings presented here are preliminary, highlighting the potential of FAIntbench to advance future research aimed at mitigating the biases in T2I models. Our benchmark is publicly available to ensure the reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Memory-guided Network with Uncertainty-based Feature Augmentation for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of supervised semantic segmentation methods highly relies on the availability of large-scale training data. To alleviate this dependence, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) is introduced to leverage the model trained on base classes with sufficient data into the segmentation of novel classes with few data. FSS methods face the challenge of model generalization on novel classes due to the distribution shift between base and novel classes. To overcome this issue, we propose a class-shared memory (CSM) module consisting of a set of learnable memory vectors. These memory vectors learn elemental object patterns from base classes during training whilst re-encoding query features during both training and inference, thereby improving the distribution alignment between base and novel classes. Furthermore, to cope with the performance degradation resulting from the intra-class variance across images, we introduce an uncertainty-based feature augmentation (UFA) module to produce diverse query features during training for improving the model's robustness. We integrate CSM and UFA into representative FSS works, with experimental results on the widely-used PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrating the superior performance of ours over state of the art.</description>

      <title>Global Rewards in Restless Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) extend multi-armed bandits so pulling an arm impacts future states. Despite the success of RMABs, a key limiting assumption is the separability of rewards into a sum across arms. We address this deficiency by proposing restless-multi-armed bandit with global rewards (RMAB-G), a generalization of RMABs to global non-separable rewards. To solve RMAB-G, we develop the Linear- and Shapley-Whittle indices, which extend Whittle indices from RMABs to RMAB-Gs. We prove approximation bounds but also point out how these indices could fail when reward functions are highly non-linear. To overcome this, we propose two sets of adaptive policies: the first computes indices iteratively, and the second combines indices with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies outperform baselines and index-based policies with synthetic data and real-world data from food rescue.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Excitation and Aggregation Design Adaptions in CLIP4Clip for Video-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CLIP4Clip model transferred from the CLIP has been the de-factor standard to solve the video clip retrieval task from frame-level input, triggering the surge of CLIP4Clip-based models in the video-text retrieval domain. In this work, we rethink the inherent limitation of widely-used mean pooling operation in the frame features aggregation and investigate the adaptions of excitation and aggregation design for discriminative video representation generation. We present a novel excitationand-aggregation design, including (1) The excitation module is available for capturing non-mutuallyexclusive relationships among frame features and achieving frame-wise features recalibration, and (2) The aggregation module is applied to learn exclusiveness used for frame representations aggregation. Similarly, we employ the cascade of sequential module and aggregation design to generate discriminative video representation in the sequential type. Besides, we adopt the excitation design in the tight type to obtain representative frame features for multi-modal interaction. The proposed modules are evaluated on three benchmark datasets of MSR-VTT, ActivityNet and DiDeMo, achieving MSR-VTT (43.9 R@1), ActivityNet (44.1 R@1) and DiDeMo (31.0 R@1). They outperform the CLIP4Clip results by +1.2% (+0.5%), +4.5% (+1.9%) and +9.5% (+2.7%) relative (absolute) improvements, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed excitation and aggregation designs. We hope our work will serve as an alternative for frame representations aggregation and facilitate future research.</description>

Abstract: Traditional staining normalization approaches, e.g. Macenko, typically rely on the choice of a single representative reference image, which may not adequately account for the diverse staining patterns of datasets collected in practical scenarios. In this study, we introduce a novel approach that leverages multiple reference images to enhance robustness against stain variation. Our method is parameter-free and can be adopted in existing computational pathology pipelines with no significant changes. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method through experiments using a deep-learning pipeline for automatic nuclei segmentation on colorectal images. Our results show that by leveraging multiple reference images, better results can be achieved when generalizing to external data, where the staining can widely differ from the training set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its widespread adoption as the prominent neural architecture, the Transformer has spurred several independent lines of work to address its limitations. One such approach is selective state space models, which have demonstrated promising results for language modelling. However, their feasibility for learning self-supervised, general-purpose audio representations is yet to be investigated. This work proposes Audio Mamba, a selective state space model for learning general-purpose audio representations from randomly masked spectrogram patches through self-supervision. Empirical results on ten diverse audio recognition downstream tasks show that the proposed models, pretrained on the AudioSet dataset, consistently outperform comparable self-supervised audio spectrogram transformer (SSAST) baselines by a considerable margin and demonstrate better performance in dataset size, sequence length and model size comparisons.</description>

      <title>An Independence-promoting Loss for Music Generation with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music generation schemes using language modeling rely on a vocabulary of audio tokens, generally provided as codes in a discrete latent space learnt by an auto-encoder. Multi-stage quantizers are often employed to produce these tokens, therefore the decoding strategy used for token prediction must be adapted to account for multiple codebooks: either it should model the joint distribution over all codebooks, or fit the product of the codebook marginal distributions. Modelling the joint distribution requires a costly increase in the number of auto-regressive steps, while fitting the product of the marginals yields an inexact model unless the codebooks are mutually independent. In this work, we introduce an independence-promoting loss to regularize the auto-encoder used as the tokenizer in language models for music generation. The proposed loss is a proxy for mutual information based on the maximum mean discrepancy principle, applied in reproducible kernel Hilbert spaces. Our criterion is simple to implement and train, and it is generalizable to other multi-stream codecs. We show that it reduces the statistical dependence between codebooks during auto-encoding. This leads to an increase in the generated music quality when modelling the product of the marginal distributions, while generating audio much faster than the joint distribution model.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Layer Splitting for Wireless LLM Inference in Edge Computing: A Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in edge computing environments is critical for enhancing privacy and computational efficiency. Toward efficient wireless LLM inference in edge computing, this study comprehensively analyzes the impact of different splitting points in mainstream open-source LLMs. On this basis, this study introduces a framework taking inspiration from model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to determine the optimal splitting point across the edge and user equipment (UE). By incorporating a reward surrogate model, our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of frequent performance evaluations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this method effectively balances inference performance and computational load under varying network conditions, providing a robust solution for LLM deployment in decentralized settings.</description>

      <title>EchoMamba4Rec: Harmonizing Bidirectional State Space Models with Spectral Filtering for Advanced Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting user preferences and sequential dependencies based on historical behavior is the core goal of sequential recommendation. Although attention-based models have shown effectiveness in this field, they often struggle with inference inefficiency due to the quadratic computational complexity inherent in attention mechanisms, especially with long-range behavior sequences. Drawing inspiration from the recent advancements of state space models (SSMs) in control theory, which provide a robust framework for modeling and controlling dynamic systems, we introduce EchoMamba4Rec. Control theory emphasizes the use of SSMs for managing long-range dependencies and maintaining inferential efficiency through structured state matrices. EchoMamba4Rec leverages these control relationships in sequential recommendation and integrates bi-directional processing with frequency-domain filtering to capture complex patterns and dependencies in user interaction data more effectively. Our model benefits from the ability of state space models (SSMs) to learn and perform parallel computations, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and scalability. It features a bi-directional Mamba module that incorporates both forward and reverse Mamba components, leveraging information from both past and future interactions. Additionally, a filter layer operates in the frequency domain using learnable Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and learnable filters, followed by an inverse FFT to refine item embeddings and reduce noise. We also integrate Gate Linear Units (GLU) to dynamically control information flow, enhancing the model's expressiveness and training stability. Experimental results demonstrate that EchoMamba significantly outperforms existing models, providing more accurate and personalized recommendations.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Optimization with Automated Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, such as maximum cut and maximum independent set. The core idea behind these methods is to represent a CO problem as a graph and then use GNNs to learn the node/graph embedding with combinatorial information. Although these methods have achieved promising results, given a specific CO problem, the design of GNN architectures still requires heavy manual work with domain knowledge. Existing automated GNNs are mostly focused on traditional graph learning problems, which is inapplicable to solving NP-hard CO problems. To this end, we present a new class of \textbf{AUTO}mated \textbf{G}NNs for solving \textbf{NP}-hard problems, namely \textbf{AutoGNP}. We represent CO problems by GNNs and focus on two specific problems, i.e., mixed integer linear programming and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. The idea of AutoGNP is to use graph neural architecture search algorithms to automatically find the best GNNs for a given NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Compared with existing graph neural architecture search algorithms, AutoGNP utilizes two-hop operators in the architecture search space. Moreover, AutoGNP utilizes simulated annealing and a strict early stopping policy to avoid local optimal solutions. Empirical results on benchmark combinatorial problems demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</description>

      <title>Generalized Source Tracing: Detecting Novel Audio Deepfake Algorithm with Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of deepfake audio, there is an urgent need to investigate their attribution. Current source tracing methods can effectively distinguish in-distribution (ID) categories. However, the rapid evolution of deepfake algorithms poses a critical challenge in the accurate identification of out-of-distribution (OOD) novel deepfake algorithms. In this paper, we propose Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion (REFD) strategy for audio deepfake algorithm recognition, demonstrating its effectiveness in discriminating ID samples while identifying OOD samples. For effective OOD detection, we first explore current post-hoc OOD methods and propose NSD, a novel OOD approach in identifying novel deepfake algorithms through the similarity consideration of both feature and logits scores. REFD achieves 86.83% F1-score as a single system in Audio Deepfake Detection Challenge 2023 Track3, showcasing its state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguring Participatory Design to Resist AI Realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing trend of artificial intelligence (AI) as a solution to social and technical problems reinforces AI Realism -- the belief that AI is an inevitable and natural order. In response, this paper argues that participatory design (PD), with its focus on democratic values and processes, can play a role in questioning and resisting AI Realism. I examine three concerning aspects of AI Realism: the facade of democratization that lacks true empowerment, demands for human adaptability in contrast to AI systems' inflexibility, and the obfuscation of essential human labor enabling the AI system. I propose resisting AI Realism by reconfiguring PD to continue engaging with value-centered visions, increasing its exploration of non-AI alternatives, and making the essential human labor underpinning AI systems visible. I position PD as a means to generate friction against AI Realism and open space for alternative futures centered on human needs and values.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility study of FairAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to reproduce the findings of the paper "Fair Attribute Completion on Graph with Missing Attributes" written by Guo, Chu, and Li arXiv:2302.12977 by investigating the claims made in the paper. This paper suggests that the results of the original paper are reproducible and thus, the claims hold. However, the claim that FairAC is a generic framework for many downstream tasks is very broad and could therefore only be partially tested. Moreover, we show that FairAC is generalizable to various datasets and sensitive attributes and show evidence that the improvement in group fairness of the FairAC framework does not come at the expense of individual fairness. Lastly, the codebase of FairAC has been refactored and is now easily applicable for various datasets and models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are shown to learn rich joint image-text representations enabling high performances in relevant downstream tasks. However, they fail to showcase their quantitative understanding of objects, and they lack good counting-aware representation. This paper conducts a reproducibility study of 'Teaching CLIP to Count to Ten' (Paiss et al., 2023), which presents a method to finetune a CLIP model (Radford et al., 2021) to improve zero-shot counting accuracy in an image while maintaining the performance for zero-shot classification by introducing a counting-contrastive loss term. We improve the model's performance on a smaller subset of their training data with lower computational resources. We verify these claims by reproducing their study with our own code. The implementation can be found at https://github.com/SforAiDl/CountCLIP.</description>

      <title>Decision-focused Graph Neural Networks for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been notable interest in investigating combinatorial optimization (CO) problems by neural-based framework. An emerging strategy to tackle these challenging problems involves the adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs) as an alternative to traditional algorithms, a subject that has attracted considerable attention. Despite the growing popularity of GNNs and traditional algorithm solvers in the realm of CO, there is limited research on their integrated use and the correlation between them within an end-to-end framework. The primary focus of our work is to formulate a more efficient and precise framework for CO by employing decision-focused learning on graphs. Additionally, we introduce a decision-focused framework that utilizes GNNs to address CO problems with auxiliary support. To realize an end-to-end approach, we have designed two cascaded modules: (a) an unsupervised trained graph predictive model, and (b) a solver for quadratic binary unconstrained optimization. Empirical evaluations are conducted on various classical tasks, including maximum cut, maximum independent set, and minimum vertex cover. The experimental results on classical CO problems (i.e. MaxCut, MIS, and MVC) demonstrate the superiority of our method over both the standalone GNN approach and classical methods.</description>

      <title>HeSum: a Novel Dataset for Abstractive Text Summarization in Hebrew</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in various natural language tasks in English, their performance in lower-resourced languages like Hebrew, especially for generative tasks such as abstractive summarization, remains unclear. The high morphological richness in Hebrew adds further challenges due to the ambiguity in sentence comprehension and the complexities in meaning construction. In this paper, we address this resource and evaluation gap by introducing HeSum, a novel benchmark specifically designed for abstractive text summarization in Modern Hebrew. HeSum consists of 10,000 article-summary pairs sourced from Hebrew news websites written by professionals. Linguistic analysis confirms HeSum's high abstractness and unique morphological challenges. We show that HeSum presents distinct difficulties for contemporary state-of-the-art LLMs, establishing it as a valuable testbed for generative language technology in Hebrew, and MRLs generative challenges in general.</description>

      <title>American Sign Language Handshapes Reflect Pressures for Communicative Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communicative efficiency is a key topic in linguistics and cognitive psychology, with many studies demonstrating how the pressure to communicate with minimal effort guides the form of natural language. However, this phenomenon is rarely explored in signed languages. This paper shows how handshapes in American Sign Language (ASL) reflect these efficiency pressures and provides new evidence of communicative efficiency in the visual-gestural modality.
  We focus on hand configurations in native ASL signs and signs borrowed from English to compare efficiency pressures from both ASL and English usage. First, we develop new methodologies to quantify the articulatory effort needed to produce handshapes and the perceptual effort required to recognize them. Then, we analyze correlations between communicative effort and usage statistics in ASL or English. Our findings reveal that frequent ASL handshapes are easier to produce and that pressures for communicative efficiency mostly come from ASL usage, rather than from English lexical borrowing.</description>

      <title>Compressible Dynamics in Deep Overparameterized Low-Rank Learning &amp; Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While overparameterization in machine learning models offers great benefits in terms of optimization and generalization, it also leads to increased computational requirements as model sizes grow. In this work, we show that by leveraging the inherent low-dimensional structures of data and compressible dynamics within the model parameters, we can reap the benefits of overparameterization without the computational burdens. In practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for deep low-rank matrix completion as well as fine-tuning language models. Our approach is grounded in theoretical findings for deep overparameterized low-rank matrix recovery, where we show that the learning dynamics of each weight matrix are confined to an invariant low-dimensional subspace. Consequently, we can construct and train compact, highly compressed factorizations possessing the same benefits as their overparameterized counterparts. In the context of deep matrix completion, our technique substantially improves training efficiency while retaining the advantages of overparameterization. For language model fine-tuning, we propose a method called "Deep LoRA", which improves the existing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique, leading to reduced overfitting and a simplified hyperparameter setup, while maintaining comparable efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of Deep LoRA on natural language tasks, particularly when fine-tuning with limited data. Our code is available at https://github.com/cjyaras/deep-lora-transformers.</description>

      <title>Improving Alignment and Robustness with Circuit Breakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI systems can take harmful actions and are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We present an approach, inspired by recent advances in representation engineering, that interrupts the models as they respond with harmful outputs with "circuit breakers." Existing techniques aimed at improving alignment, such as refusal training, are often bypassed. Techniques such as adversarial training try to plug these holes by countering specific attacks. As an alternative to refusal training and adversarial training, circuit-breaking directly controls the representations that are responsible for harmful outputs in the first place. Our technique can be applied to both text-only and multimodal language models to prevent the generation of harmful outputs without sacrificing utility -- even in the presence of powerful unseen attacks. Notably, while adversarial robustness in standalone image recognition remains an open challenge, circuit breakers allow the larger multimodal system to reliably withstand image "hijacks" that aim to produce harmful content. Finally, we extend our approach to AI agents, demonstrating considerable reductions in the rate of harmful actions when they are under attack. Our approach represents a significant step forward in the development of reliable safeguards to harmful behavior and adversarial attacks.</description>

Abstract: Despite the advances in text-to-image synthesis, particularly with diffusion models, generating visual instructions that require consistent representation and smooth state transitions of objects across sequential steps remains a formidable challenge. This paper introduces a simple, training-free framework to tackle the issues, capitalizing on the advancements in diffusion models and large language models (LLMs). Our approach systematically integrates text comprehension and image generation to ensure visual instructions are visually appealing and maintain consistency and accuracy throughout the instruction sequence. We validate the effectiveness by testing multi-step instructions and comparing the text alignment and consistency with several baselines. Our experiments show that our approach can visualize coherent and visually pleasing instructions</description>
