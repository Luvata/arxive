      <title>SS-ADA: A Semi-Supervised Active Domain Adaptation Framework for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation plays an important role in intelligent vehicles, providing pixel-level semantic information about the environment. However, the labeling budget is expensive and time-consuming when semantic segmentation model is applied to new driving scenarios. To reduce the costs, semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods have been proposed to leverage large quantities of unlabeled images. Despite this, their performance still falls short of the accuracy required for practical applications, which is typically achieved by supervised learning. A significant shortcoming is that they typically select unlabeled images for annotation randomly, neglecting the assessment of sample value for model training. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised active domain adaptation (SS-ADA) framework for semantic segmentation that employs an image-level acquisition strategy. SS-ADA integrates active learning into semi-supervised semantic segmentation to achieve the accuracy of supervised learning with a limited amount of labeled data from the target domain. Additionally, we design an IoU-based class weighting strategy to alleviate the class imbalance problem using annotations from active learning. We conducted extensive experiments on synthetic-to-real and real-to-real domain adaptation settings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. SS-ADA can achieve or even surpass the accuracy of its supervised learning counterpart with only 25% of the target labeled data when using a real-time segmentation model. The code for SS-ADA is available at https://github.com/ywher/SS-ADA.</description>

      <title>Multi-Granularity and Multi-modal Feature Interaction Approach for Text Video Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key of the text-to-video retrieval (TVR) task lies in learning the unique similarity between each pair of text (consisting of words) and video (consisting of audio and image frames) representations. However, some problems exist in the representation alignment of video and text, such as a text, and further each word, are of different importance for video frames. Besides, audio usually carries additional or critical information for TVR in the case that frames carry little valid information. Therefore, in TVR task, multi-granularity representation of text, including whole sentence and every word, and the modal of audio are salutary which are underutilized in most existing works. To address this, we propose a novel multi-granularity feature interaction module called MGFI, consisting of text-frame and word-frame, for video-text representations alignment. Moreover, we introduce a cross-modal feature interaction module of audio and text called CMFI to solve the problem of insufficient expression of frames in the video. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Dark Transformer: A Video Transformer for Action Recognition in the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing human actions in adverse lighting conditions presents significant challenges in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications in visual surveillance and nighttime driving. Existing methods tackle action recognition and dark enhancement separately, limiting the potential for end-to-end learning of spatiotemporal representations for video action classification. This paper introduces Dark Transformer, a novel video transformer-based approach for action recognition in low-light environments. Dark Transformer leverages spatiotemporal self-attention mechanisms in cross-domain settings to enhance cross-domain action recognition. By extending video transformers to learn cross-domain knowledge, Dark Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark action recognition datasets, including InFAR, XD145, and ARID. The proposed approach demonstrates significant promise in addressing the challenges of action recognition in adverse lighting conditions, offering practical implications for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Trade-offs in Knowledge Distillation for CNNs and Vision Transformers at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses four facets of the Knowledge Distillation (KD) process for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, particularly when executed on edge devices with constrained processing capabilities. First, we conduct a comparative analysis of the KD process between CNNs and ViT architectures, aiming to elucidate the feasibility and efficacy of employing different architectural configurations for the teacher and student, while assessing their performance and efficiency. Second, we explore the impact of varying the size of the student model on accuracy and inference speed, while maintaining a constant KD duration. Third, we examine the effects of employing higher resolution images on the accuracy, memory footprint and computational workload. Last, we examine the performance improvements obtained by fine-tuning the student model after KD to specific downstream tasks. Through empirical evaluations and analyses, this research provides AI practitioners with insights into optimal strategies for maximizing the effectiveness of the KD process on edge devices.</description>

      <title>ChatBCG: Can AI Read Your Slide Deck?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal models like GPT4o and Gemini Flash are exceptional at inference and summarization tasks, which approach human-level in performance. However, we find that these models underperform compared to humans when asked to do very specific 'reading and estimation' tasks, particularly in the context of visual charts in business decks. This paper evaluates the accuracy of GPT 4o and Gemini Flash-1.5 in answering straightforward questions about data on labeled charts (where data is clearly annotated on the graphs), and unlabeled charts (where data is not clearly annotated and has to be inferred from the X and Y axis). We conclude that these models aren't currently capable of reading a deck accurately end-to-end if it contains any complex or unlabeled charts. Even if a user created a deck of only labeled charts, the model would only be able to read 7-8 out of 15 labeled charts perfectly end-to-end.

      <title>GeoGuide: Geometric guidance of diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are among the most effective methods for image generation. This is in particular because, unlike GANs, they can be easily conditioned during training to produce elements with desired class or properties. However, guiding a pre-trained diffusion model to generate elements from previously unlabeled data is significantly more challenging. One of the possible solutions was given by the ADM-G guiding approach. Although ADM-G successfully generates elements from the given class, there is a significant quality gap compared to a model originally conditioned on this class. In particular, the FID score obtained by the ADM-G-guided diffusion model is nearly three times lower than the class-conditioned guidance. We demonstrate that this issue is partly due to ADM-G providing minimal guidance during the final stage of the denoising process. To address this problem, we propose GeoGuide, a guidance model based on tracing the distance of the diffusion model's trajectory from the data manifold. The main idea of GeoGuide is to produce normalized adjustments during the backward denoising process. As shown in the experiments, GeoGuide surpasses the probabilistic approach ADM-G with respect to both the FID scores and the quality of the generated images.</description>

      <title>Global-Local Similarity for Efficient Fine-Grained Image Recognition with Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained recognition involves the classification of images from subordinate macro-categories, and it is challenging due to small inter-class differences. To overcome this, most methods perform discriminative feature selection enabled by a feature extraction backbone followed by a high-level feature refinement step. Recently, many studies have shown the potential behind vision transformers as a backbone for fine-grained recognition, but their usage of its attention mechanism to select discriminative tokens can be computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a novel and computationally inexpensive metric to identify discriminative regions in an image. We compare the similarity between the global representation of an image given by the CLS token, a learnable token used by transformers for classification, and the local representation of individual patches. We select the regions with the highest similarity to obtain crops, which are forwarded through the same transformer encoder. Finally, high-level features of the original and cropped representations are further refined together in order to make more robust predictions. Through extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, obtaining favorable results in terms of accuracy across a variety of datasets. Furthermore, our method achieves these results at a much lower computational cost compared to the alternatives.

      <title>DreamStory: Open-Domain Story Visualization by LLM-Guided Multi-Subject Consistent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Story visualization aims to create visually compelling images or videos corresponding to textual narratives. Despite recent advances in diffusion models yielding promising results, existing methods still struggle to create a coherent sequence of subject-consistent frames based solely on a story. To this end, we propose DreamStory, an automatic open-domain story visualization framework by leveraging the LLMs and a novel multi-subject consistent diffusion model. DreamStory consists of (1) an LLM acting as a story director and (2) an innovative Multi-Subject consistent Diffusion model (MSD) for generating consistent multi-subject across the images. First, DreamStory employs the LLM to generate descriptive prompts for subjects and scenes aligned with the story, annotating each scene's subjects for subsequent subject-consistent generation. Second, DreamStory utilizes these detailed subject descriptions to create portraits of the subjects, with these portraits and their corresponding textual information serving as multimodal anchors (guidance). Finally, the MSD uses these multimodal anchors to generate story scenes with consistent multi-subject. Specifically, the MSD includes Masked Mutual Self-Attention (MMSA) and Masked Mutual Cross-Attention (MMCA) modules. MMSA and MMCA modules ensure appearance and semantic consistency with reference images and text, respectively. Both modules employ masking mechanisms to prevent subject blending. To validate our approach and promote progress in story visualization, we established a benchmark, DS-500, which can assess the overall performance of the story visualization framework, subject-identification accuracy, and the consistency of the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DreamStory in both subjective and objective evaluations. Please visit our project homepage at https://dream-xyz.github.io/dreamstory.</description>

      <title>Text- and Feature-based Models for Compound Multimodal Emotion Recognition in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems for multimodal Emotion Recognition (ER) commonly rely on features extracted from different modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and textual) to predict the seven basic emotions. However, compound emotions often occur in real-world scenarios and are more difficult to predict. Compound multimodal ER becomes more challenging in videos due to the added uncertainty of diverse modalities.
  In addition, standard features-based models may not fully capture the complex and subtle cues needed to understand compound emotions.
  %%%%
  Since relevant cues can be extracted in the form of text, we advocate for textualizing all modalities, such as visual and audio, to harness the capacity of large language models (LLMs). These models may understand the complex interaction between modalities and the subtleties of complex emotions. Although training an LLM requires large-scale datasets, a recent surge of pre-trained LLMs, such as BERT and LLaMA, can be easily fine-tuned for downstream tasks like compound ER.
  This paper compares two multimodal modeling approaches for compound ER in videos -- standard feature-based vs. text-based. Experiments were conducted on the challenging C-EXPR-DB dataset for compound ER, and contrasted with results on the MELD dataset for basic ER.

      <title>GenRC: Generative 3D Room Completion from Sparse Image Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse RGBD scene completion is a challenging task especially when considering consistent textures and geometries throughout the entire scene. Different from existing solutions that rely on human-designed text prompts or predefined camera trajectories, we propose GenRC, an automated training-free pipeline to complete a room-scale 3D mesh with high-fidelity textures. To achieve this, we first project the sparse RGBD images to a highly incomplete 3D mesh. Instead of iteratively generating novel views to fill in the void, we utilized our proposed E-Diffusion to generate a view-consistent panoramic RGBD image which ensures global geometry and appearance consistency. Furthermore, we maintain the input-output scene stylistic consistency through textual inversion to replace human-designed text prompts. To bridge the domain gap among datasets, E-Diffusion leverages models trained on large-scale datasets to generate diverse appearances. GenRC outperforms state-of-the-art methods under most appearance and geometric metrics on ScanNet and ARKitScenes datasets, even though GenRC is not trained on these datasets nor using predefined camera trajectories.

      <title>AdaLog: Post-Training Quantization for Vision Transformers with Adaptive Logarithm Quantizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has become one of the most prevailing fundamental backbone networks in the computer vision community. Despite the high accuracy, deploying it in real applications raises critical challenges including the high computational cost and inference latency. Recently, the post-training quantization (PTQ) technique has emerged as a promising way to enhance ViT's efficiency. Nevertheless, existing PTQ approaches for ViT suffer from the inflexible quantization on the post-Softmax and post-GELU activations that obey the power-law-like distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel non-uniform quantizer, dubbed the Adaptive Logarithm AdaLog (AdaLog) quantizer. It optimizes the logarithmic base to accommodate the power-law-like distribution of activations, while simultaneously allowing for hardware-friendly quantization and de-quantization. By employing the bias reparameterization, the AdaLog quantizer is applicable to both the post-Softmax and post-GELU activations. Moreover, we develop an efficient Fast Progressive Combining Search (FPCS) strategy to determine the optimal logarithm base for AdaLog, as well as the scaling factors and zero points for the uniform quantizers. Extensive experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for various ViT-based architectures and vision tasks including classification, object detection, and instance segmentation.

      <title>Denoising Diffusions in Latent Space for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation, often times outperforming other generative models. Since their introduction, the powerful noise-to-image denoising pipeline has been extended to various discriminative tasks, including image segmentation. In case of medical imaging, often times the images are large 3D scans, where segmenting one image using DPMs become extremely inefficient due to large memory consumption and time consuming iterative sampling process. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative modeling framework (LDSeg) that performs diffusion in latent space for medical image segmentation. Our proposed framework leverages the learned inherent low-dimensional latent distribution of the target object shapes and source image embeddings. The conditional diffusion in latent space not only ensures accurate n-D image segmentation for multi-label objects, but also mitigates the major underlying problems of the traditional DPM based segmentation: (1) large memory consumption, (2) time consuming sampling process and (3) unnatural noise injection in forward/reverse process. LDSeg achieved state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy on three medical image datasets with different imaging modalities. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model is significantly more robust to noises, compared to the traditional deterministic segmentation models, which can be potential in solving the domain shift problems in the medical imaging domain.

      <description>arXiv:2407.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emotion recognition has attracted more attention in recent decades. Although significant progress has been made in the recognition technology of the seven basic emotions, existing methods are still hard to tackle compound emotion recognition that occurred commonly in practical application. This article introduces our achievements in the 7th Field Emotion Behavior Analysis (ABAW) competition. In the competition, we selected pre trained ResNet18 and Transformer, which have been widely validated, as the basic network framework. Considering the continuity of emotions over time, we propose a time pyramid structure network for frame level emotion prediction. Furthermore. At the same time, in order to address the lack of data in composite emotion recognition, we utilized fine-grained labels from the DFEW database to construct training data for emotion categories in competitions. Taking into account the characteristics of valence arousal of various complex emotions, we constructed a classification framework from coarse to fine in the label space.</description>

      <title>ActionSwitch: Class-agnostic Detection of Simultaneous Actions in Streaming Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Temporal Action Localization (On-TAL) is a critical task that aims to instantaneously identify action instances in untrimmed streaming videos as soon as an action concludes -- a major leap from frame-based Online Action Detection (OAD). Yet, the challenge of detecting overlapping actions is often overlooked even though it is a common scenario in streaming videos. Current methods that can address concurrent actions depend heavily on class information, limiting their flexibility. This paper introduces ActionSwitch, the first class-agnostic On-TAL framework capable of detecting overlapping actions. By obviating the reliance on class information, ActionSwitch provides wider applicability to various situations, including overlapping actions of the same class or scenarios where class information is unavailable. This approach is complemented by the proposed "conservativeness loss", which directly embeds a conservative decision-making principle into the loss function for On-TAL. Our ActionSwitch achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex datasets, including Epic-Kitchens 100 targeting the challenging egocentric view and FineAction consisting of fine-grained actions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Gene Expression Prediction from Histology Images with Spatial Transcriptomics Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics is a novel technology that aligns histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Although groundbreaking, it struggles with gene capture yielding high corruption in acquired data. Given potential applications, recent efforts have focused on predicting transcriptomic profiles solely from histology images. However, differences in databases, preprocessing techniques, and training hyperparameters hinder a fair comparison between methods. To address these challenges, we present a systematically curated and processed database collected from 26 public sources, representing an 8.6-fold increase compared to previous works. Additionally, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer based completion technique for inferring missing gene expression, which significantly boosts the performance of transcriptomic profile predictions across all datasets. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on spatial transcriptomics.</description>

      <title>ColorMAE: Exploring data-independent masking strategies in Masked AutoEncoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked AutoEncoders (MAE) have emerged as a robust self-supervised framework, offering remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. To increase the difficulty of the pretext task and learn richer visual representations, existing works have focused on replacing standard random masking with more sophisticated strategies, such as adversarial-guided and teacher-guided masking. However, these strategies depend on the input data thus commonly increasing the model complexity and requiring additional calculations to generate the mask patterns. This raises the question: Can we enhance MAE performance beyond random masking without relying on input data or incurring additional computational costs? In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective data-independent method, termed ColorMAE, which generates different binary mask patterns by filtering random noise. Drawing inspiration from color noise in image processing, we explore four types of filters to yield mask patterns with different spatial and semantic priors. ColorMAE requires no additional learnable parameters or computational overhead in the network, yet it significantly enhances the learned representations. We provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation, demonstrating our strategy's superiority in downstream tasks compared to random masking. Notably, we report an improvement of 2.72 in mIoU in semantic segmentation tasks relative to baseline MAE implementations.</description>

      <title>Universal Facial Encoding of Codec Avatars from VR Headsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faithful real-time facial animation is essential for avatar-mediated telepresence in Virtual Reality (VR). To emulate authentic communication, avatar animation needs to be efficient and accurate: able to capture both extreme and subtle expressions within a few milliseconds to sustain the rhythm of natural conversations. The oblique and incomplete views of the face, variability in the donning of headsets, and illumination variation due to the environment are some of the unique challenges in generalization to unseen faces. In this paper, we present a method that can animate a photorealistic avatar in realtime from head-mounted cameras (HMCs) on a consumer VR headset. We present a self-supervised learning approach, based on a cross-view reconstruction objective, that enables generalization to unseen users. We present a lightweight expression calibration mechanism that increases accuracy with minimal additional cost to run-time efficiency. We present an improved parameterization for precise ground-truth generation that provides robustness to environmental variation. The resulting system produces accurate facial animation for unseen users wearing VR headsets in realtime. We compare our approach to prior face-encoding methods demonstrating significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Temporal Action Localization: Advanced S6 Modeling with Recurrent Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) is a critical task in video analysis, identifying precise start and end times of actions. Existing methods like CNNs, RNNs, GCNs, and Transformers have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies and temporal causality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel TAL architecture leveraging the Selective State Space Model (S6). Our approach integrates the Feature Aggregated Bi-S6 block, Dual Bi-S6 structure, and a recurrent mechanism to enhance temporal and channel-wise dependency modeling without increasing parameter complexity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results with mAP scores of 74.2% on THUMOS-14, 42.9% on ActivityNet, 29.6% on FineAction, and 45.8% on HACS. Ablation studies validate our method's effectiveness, showing that the Dual structure in the Stem module and the recurrent mechanism outperform traditional approaches. Our findings demonstrate the potential of S6-based models in TAL tasks, paving the way for future research.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Video-Text Understanding: Retrieval from Counterfactually Augmented Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent video-text foundation models have demonstrated strong performance on a wide variety of downstream video understanding tasks. Can these video-text models genuinely understand the contents of natural videos? Standard video-text evaluations could be misleading as many questions can be inferred merely from the objects and contexts in a single frame or biases inherent in the datasets. In this paper, we aim to better assess the capabilities of current video-text models and understand their limitations. We propose a novel evaluation task for video-text understanding, namely retrieval from counterfactually augmented data (RCAD), and a new Feint6K dataset. To succeed on our new evaluation task, models must derive a comprehensive understanding of the video from cross-frame reasoning. Analyses show that previous video-text foundation models can be easily fooled by counterfactually augmented data and are far behind human-level performance. In order to narrow the gap between video-text models and human performance on RCAD, we identify a key limitation of current contrastive approaches on video-text data and introduce LLM-teacher, a more effective approach to learn action semantics by leveraging knowledge obtained from a pretrained large language model. Experiments and analyses show that our approach successfully learn more discriminative action embeddings and improves results on Feint6K when applied to multiple video-text models. Our Feint6K dataset and project page is available at https://feint6k.github.io.</description>

      <title>Audio-visual Generalized Zero-shot Learning the Easy Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual generalized zero-shot learning is a rapidly advancing domain that seeks to understand the intricate relations between audio and visual cues within videos. The overarching goal is to leverage insights from seen classes to identify instances from previously unseen ones. Prior approaches primarily utilized synchronized auto-encoders to reconstruct audio-visual attributes, which were informed by cross-attention transformers and projected text embeddings. However, these methods fell short of effectively capturing the intricate relationship between cross-modal features and class-label embeddings inherent in pre-trained language-aligned embeddings. To circumvent these bottlenecks, we introduce a simple yet effective framework for Easy Audio-Visual Generalized Zero-shot Learning, named EZ-AVGZL, that aligns audio-visual embeddings with transformed text representations. It utilizes a single supervised text audio-visual contrastive loss to learn an alignment between audio-visual and textual modalities, moving away from the conventional approach of reconstructing cross-modal features and text embeddings. Our key insight is that while class name embeddings are well aligned with language-based audio-visual features, they don't provide sufficient class separation to be useful for zero-shot learning. To address this, our method leverages differential optimization to transform class embeddings into a more discriminative space while preserving the semantic structure of language representations. We conduct extensive experiments on VGGSound-GZSL, UCF-GZSL, and ActivityNet-GZSL benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that our EZ-AVGZL achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual generalized zero-shot learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's forests play an important role in the fight against climate change, and are in turn negatively affected by it. Effective monitoring of different tree species is essential to understanding and improving the health and biodiversity of forests. In this work, we address the challenge of tree species identification by performing semantic segmentation of trees using an aerial image dataset spanning over a year. We compare models trained on single images versus those trained on time series to assess the impact of tree phenology on segmentation performances. We also introduce a simple convolutional block for extracting spatio-temporal features from image time series, enabling the use of popular pretrained backbones and methods. We leverage the hierarchical structure of tree species taxonomy by incorporating a custom loss function that refines predictions at three levels: species, genus, and higher-level taxa. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of our methodology in exploiting the time series modality and confirm that enriching labels using taxonomic information improves the semantic segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>UCIP: A Universal Framework for Compressed Image Super-Resolution using Dynamic Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressed Image Super-resolution (CSR) aims to simultaneously super-resolve the compressed images and tackle the challenging hybrid distortions caused by compression. However, existing works on CSR usually focuses on a single compression codec, i.e., JPEG, ignoring the diverse traditional or learning-based codecs in the practical application, e.g., HEVC, VVC, HIFIC, etc. In this work, we propose the first universal CSR framework, dubbed UCIP, with dynamic prompt learning, intending to jointly support the CSR distortions of any compression codecs/modes. Particularly, an efficient dynamic prompt strategy is proposed to mine the content/spatial-aware task-adaptive contextual information for the universal CSR task, using only a small amount of prompts with spatial size 1x1. To simplify contextual information mining, we introduce the novel MLP-like framework backbone for our UCIP by adapting the Active Token Mixer (ATM) to CSR tasks for the first time, where the global information modeling is only taken in horizontal and vertical directions with offset prediction. We also build an all-in-one benchmark dataset for the CSR task by collecting the datasets with the popular 6 diverse traditional and learning-based codecs, including JPEG, HEVC, VVC, HIFIC, etc., resulting in 23 common degradations. Extensive experiments have shown the consistent and excellent performance of our UCIP on universal CSR tasks. The project can be found in https://lixinustc.github.io/UCIP.github.io</description>

      <title>HPPP: Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point Algorithms and Applications to Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preconditioned Proximal Point (PPP) algorithms provide a unified framework for splitting methods in image restoration. Recent advancements with RED (Regularization by Denoising) and PnP (Plug-and-Play) priors have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this domain, emphasizing the need for a meaningful particular solution. However, degenerate PPP algorithms typically exhibit weak convergence in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, leading to uncertain solutions. To address this issue, we propose the Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence properties of Halpern iteration to achieve a particular solution. Based on the implicit regularization defined by gradient RED, we further introduce the Gradient REgularization by Denoising via HPPP called GraRED-HP3 algorithm. The HPPP algorithm is shown to have the regularity converging to a particular solution by a toy example. Additionally, experiments in image deblurring and inpainting validate the effectiveness of GraRED-HP3, showing it surpasses classical methods such as Chambolle-Pock (CP), PPP, RED, and RED-PRO.</description>

      <title>FocusDiffuser: Perceiving Local Disparities for Camouflaged Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting objects seamlessly blended into their surroundings represents a complex task for both human cognitive capabilities and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. Currently, the majority of methodologies for detecting camouflaged objects mainly focus on utilizing discriminative models with various unique designs. However, it has been observed that generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, possess stronger capabilities for understanding various objects in complex environments; Yet their potential for the cognition and detection of camouflaged objects has not been extensively explored. In this study, we present a novel denoising diffusion model, namely FocusDiffuser, to investigate how generative models can enhance the detection and interpretation of camouflaged objects. We believe that the secret to spotting camouflaged objects lies in catching the subtle nuances in details. Consequently, our FocusDiffuser innovatively integrates specialized enhancements, notably the Boundary-Driven LookUp (BDLU) module and Cyclic Positioning (CP) module, to elevate standard diffusion models, significantly boosting the detail-oriented analytical capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that FocusDiffuser, from a generative perspective, effectively addresses the challenge of camouflaged object detection, surpassing leading models on benchmarks like CAMO, COD10K and NC4K.</description>

      <title>OE-BevSeg: An Object Informed and Environment Aware Multimodal Framework for Bird's-eye-view Vehicle Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation is becoming crucial in autonomous driving systems. It realizes ego-vehicle surrounding environment perception by projecting 2D multi-view images into 3D world space. Recently, BEV segmentation has made notable progress, attributed to better view transformation modules, larger image encoders, or more temporal information. However, there are still two issues: 1) a lack of effective understanding and enhancement of BEV space features, particularly in accurately capturing long-distance environmental features and 2) recognizing fine details of target objects. To address these issues, we propose OE-BevSeg, an end-to-end multimodal framework that enhances BEV segmentation performance through global environment-aware perception and local target object enhancement. OE-BevSeg employs an environment-aware BEV compressor. Based on prior knowledge about the main composition of the BEV surrounding environment varying with the increase of distance intervals, long-sequence global modeling is utilized to improve the model's understanding and perception of the environment. From the perspective of enriching target object information in segmentation results, we introduce the center-informed object enhancement module, using centerness information to supervise and guide the segmentation head, thereby enhancing segmentation performance from a local enhancement perspective. Additionally, we designed a multimodal fusion branch that integrates multi-view RGB image features with radar/LiDAR features, achieving significant performance improvements. Extensive experiments show that, whether in camera-only or multimodal fusion BEV segmentation tasks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results by a large margin on the nuScenes dataset for vehicle segmentation, demonstrating superior applicability in the field of autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Image Inpainting Models are Effective Tools for Instruction-guided Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the technique report for the winning solution of the CVPR2024 GenAI Media Generation Challenge Workshop's Instruction-guided Image Editing track. Instruction-guided image editing has been largely studied in recent years. The most advanced methods, such as SmartEdit and MGIE, usually combine large language models with diffusion models through joint training, where the former provides text understanding ability, and the latter provides image generation ability. However, in our experiments, we find that simply connecting large language models and image generation models through intermediary guidance such as masks instead of joint fine-tuning leads to a better editing performance and success rate. We use a 4-step process IIIE (Inpainting-based Instruction-guided Image Editing): editing category classification, main editing object identification, editing mask acquisition, and image inpainting. Results show that through proper combinations of language models and image inpainting models, our pipeline can reach a high success rate with satisfying visual quality.</description>

      <title>DFMSD: Dual Feature Masking Stage-wise Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, current mainstream feature masking distillation methods mainly function by reconstructing selectively masked regions of a student network from the feature maps of a teacher network. In these methods, attention mechanisms can help to identify spatially important regions and crucial object-aware channel clues, such that the reconstructed features are encoded with sufficient discriminative and representational power similar to teacher features. However, previous feature-masking distillation methods mainly address homogeneous knowledge distillation without fully taking into account the heterogeneous knowledge distillation scenario. In particular, the huge discrepancy between the teacher and the student frameworks within the heterogeneous distillation paradigm is detrimental to feature masking, leading to deteriorating reconstructed student features. In this study, a novel dual feature-masking heterogeneous distillation framework termed DFMSD is proposed for object detection. More specifically, a stage-wise adaptation learning module is incorporated into the dual feature-masking framework, and thus the student model can be progressively adapted to the teacher models for bridging the gap between heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, a masking enhancement strategy is combined with stage-wise learning such that object-aware masking regions are adaptively strengthened to improve feature-masking reconstruction. In addition, semantic alignment is performed at each Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) layer between the teacher and the student networks for generating consistent feature distributions. Our experiments for the object detection task demonstrate the promise of our approach, suggesting that DFMSD outperforms both the state-of-the-art heterogeneous and homogeneous distillation methods.</description>

      <title>Real-Time 3D Occupancy Prediction via Geometric-Semantic Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving (AD) due to the fine-grained geometric perception and general object recognition capabilities. However, existing methods often incur high computational costs, which contradicts the real-time demands of AD. To this end, we first evaluate the speed and memory usage of most public available methods, aiming to redirect the focus from solely prioritizing accuracy to also considering efficiency. We then identify a core challenge in achieving both fast and accurate performance: \textbf{the strong coupling between geometry and semantic}. To address this issue, 1) we propose a Geometric-Semantic Dual-Branch Network (GSDBN) with a hybrid BEV-Voxel representation. In the BEV branch, a BEV-level temporal fusion module and a U-Net encoder is introduced to extract dense semantic features. In the voxel branch, a large-kernel re-parameterized 3D convolution is proposed to refine sparse 3D geometry and reduce computation. Moreover, we propose a novel BEV-Voxel lifting module that projects BEV features into voxel space for feature fusion of the two branches. In addition to the network design, 2) we also propose a Geometric-Semantic Decoupled Learning (GSDL) strategy. This strategy initially learns semantics with accurate geometry using ground-truth depth, and then gradually mixes predicted depth to adapt the model to the predicted geometry. Extensive experiments on the widely-used Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method, which achieves a 39.4 mIoU with 20.0 FPS. This result is $\sim 3 \times$ faster and +1.9 mIoU higher compared to FB-OCC, the winner of CVPR2023 3D Occupancy Prediction Challenge. Our code will be made open-source.</description>

      <title>Learning Camouflaged Object Detection from Noisy Pseudo Label</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) methods rely heavily on large-scale pixel-annotated training sets, which are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although weakly supervised methods offer higher annotation efficiency, their performance is far behind due to the unclear visual demarcations between foreground and background in camouflaged images. In this paper, we explore the potential of using boxes as prompts in camouflaged scenes and introduce the first weakly semi-supervised COD method, aiming for budget-efficient and high-precision camouflaged object segmentation with an extremely limited number of fully labeled images. Critically, learning from such limited set inevitably generates pseudo labels with serious noisy pixels. To address this, we propose a noise correction loss that facilitates the model's learning of correct pixels in the early learning stage, and corrects the error risk gradients dominated by noisy pixels in the memorization stage, ultimately achieving accurate segmentation of camouflaged objects from noisy labels.

      <title>Attenuation-Aware Weighted Optical Flow with Medium Transmission Map for Learning-based Visual Odometry in Underwater terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of improving learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) in underwater environments by integrating principles of underwater optical imaging to manipulate optical flow estimation. Leveraging the inherent properties of underwater imaging, the novel wflow-TartanVO is introduced, enhancing the accuracy of VO systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The proposed method utilizes a normalized medium transmission map as a weight map to adjust the estimated optical flow for emphasizing regions with lower degradation and suppressing uncertain regions affected by underwater light scattering and absorption. wflow-TartanVO does not require fine-tuning of pre-trained VO models, thus promoting its adaptability to different environments and camera models. Evaluation of different real-world underwater datasets demonstrates the outperformance of wflow-TartanVO over baseline VO methods, as evidenced by the considerably reduced Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE). The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/bachzz/wflow-TartanVO</description>

      <title>Unified-EGformer: Exposure Guided Lightweight Transformer for Mixed-Exposure Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent strides made by AI in image processing, the issue of mixed exposure, pivotal in many real-world scenarios like surveillance and photography, remains inadequately addressed. Traditional image enhancement techniques and current transformer models are limited with primary focus on either overexposure or underexposure. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified-Exposure Guided Transformer (Unified-EGformer). Our proposed solution is built upon advanced transformer architectures, equipped with local pixel-level refinement and global refinement blocks for color correction and image-wide adjustments. We employ a guided attention mechanism to precisely identify exposure-compromised regions, ensuring its adaptability across various real-world conditions. U-EGformer, with a lightweight design featuring a memory footprint (peak memory) of only $\sim$1134 MB (0.1 Million parameters) and an inference time of 95 ms (9.61x faster than the average), is a viable choice for real-time applications such as surveillance and autonomous navigation. Additionally, our model is highly generalizable, requiring minimal fine-tuning to handle multiple tasks and datasets with a single architecture.</description>

      <title>The use of the symmetric finite difference in the local binary pattern (symmetric LBP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper provides a mathematical view to the binary numbers presented in the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) feature extraction process. Symmetric finite difference is often applied in numerical analysis to enhance the accuracy of approximations. Then, the paper investigates utilization of the symmetric finite difference in the LBP formulation for face detection and facial expression recognition. It introduces a novel approach that extends the standard LBP, which typically employs eight directional derivatives, to incorporate only four directional derivatives. This approach is named symmetric LBP. The number of LBP features is reduced to 16 from 256 by the use of the symmetric LBP. The study underscores the significance of the number of directions considered in the new approach. Consequently, the results obtained emphasize the importance of the research topic.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Large Model Priors for Multiple-in-One Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image restoration aims to reconstruct the latent clear images from their degraded versions. Despite the notable achievement, existing methods predominantly focus on handling specific degradation types and thus require specialized models, impeding real-world applications in dynamic degradation scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Large Model Driven Image Restoration framework (LMDIR), a novel multiple-in-one image restoration paradigm that leverages the generic priors from large multi-modal language models (MMLMs) and the pretrained diffusion models. In detail, LMDIR integrates three key prior knowledges: 1) global degradation knowledge from MMLMs, 2) scene-aware contextual descriptions generated by MMLMs, and 3) fine-grained high-quality reference images synthesized by diffusion models guided by MMLM descriptions. Standing on above priors, our architecture comprises a query-based prompt encoder, degradation-aware transformer block injecting global degradation knowledge, content-aware transformer block incorporating scene description, and reference-based transformer block incorporating fine-grained image priors. This design facilitates single-stage training paradigm to address various degradations while supporting both automatic and user-guided restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our designed method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on multiple evaluation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>HSEmotion Team at the 7th ABAW Challenge: Multi-Task Learning and Compound Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the results of the HSEmotion team in two tasks of the seventh Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) competition, namely, multi-task learning for simultaneous prediction of facial expression, valence, arousal, and detection of action units, and compound expression recognition. We propose an efficient pipeline based on frame-level facial feature extractors pre-trained in multi-task settings to estimate valence-arousal and basic facial expressions given a facial photo. We ensure the privacy-awareness of our techniques by using the lightweight architectures of neural networks, such as MT-EmotiDDAMFN, MT-EmotiEffNet, and MT-EmotiMobileFaceNet, that can run even on a mobile device without the need to send facial video to a remote server. It was demonstrated that a significant step in improving the overall accuracy is the smoothing of neural network output scores using Gaussian or box filters. It was experimentally demonstrated that such a simple post-processing of predictions from simple blending of two top visual models improves the F1-score of facial expression recognition up to 7%. At the same time, the mean Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of valence and arousal is increased by up to 1.25 times compared to each model's frame-level predictions. As a result, our final performance score on the validation set from the multi-task learning challenge is 4.5 times higher than the baseline (1.494 vs 0.32).</description>

      <title>KFD-NeRF: Rethinking Dynamic NeRF with Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce KFD-NeRF, a novel dynamic neural radiance field integrated with an efficient and high-quality motion reconstruction framework based on Kalman filtering. Our key idea is to model the dynamic radiance field as a dynamic system whose temporally varying states are estimated based on two sources of knowledge: observations and predictions. We introduce a novel plug-in Kalman filter guided deformation field that enables accurate deformation estimation from scene observations and predictions. We use a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for observations and model the motion as locally linear to calculate predictions with motion equations. To further enhance the performance of the observation MLP, we introduce regularization in the canonical space to facilitate the network's ability to learn warping for different frames. Additionally, we employ an efficient tri-plane representation for encoding the canonical space, which has been experimentally demonstrated to converge quickly with high quality. This enables us to use a shallower observation MLP, consisting of just two layers in our implementation. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real data and compare with past dynamic NeRF methods. Our KFD-NeRF demonstrates similar or even superior rendering performance within comparable computational time and achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis performance with thorough training.</description>

      <title>Safe-SD: Safe and Traceable Stable Diffusion with Text Prompt Trigger for Invisible Generative Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, stable diffusion (SD) models have typically flourished in the field of image synthesis and personalized editing, with a range of photorealistic and unprecedented images being successfully generated. As a result, widespread interest has been ignited to develop and use various SD-based tools for visual content creation. However, the exposure of AI-created content on public platforms could raise both legal and ethical risks. In this regard, the traditional methods of adding watermarks to the already generated images (i.e. post-processing) may face a dilemma (e.g., being erased or modified) in terms of copyright protection and content monitoring, since the powerful image inversion and text-to-image editing techniques have been widely explored in SD-based methods. In this work, we propose a Safe and high-traceable Stable Diffusion framework (namely Safe-SD) to adaptively implant the graphical watermarks (e.g., QR code) into the imperceptible structure-related pixels during the generative diffusion process for supporting text-driven invisible watermarking and detection. Different from the previous high-cost injection-then-detection training framework, we design a simple and unified architecture, which makes it possible to simultaneously train watermark injection and detection in a single network, greatly improving the efficiency and convenience of use. Moreover, to further support text-driven generative watermarking and deeply explore its robustness and high-traceability, we elaborately design lambda sampling and encryption algorithm to fine-tune a latent diffuser wrapped by a VAE for balancing high-fidelity image synthesis and high-traceable watermark detection. We present our quantitative and qualitative results on two representative datasets LSUN, COCO and FFHQ, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of Safe-SD and showing it significantly outperforms the previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Adapt PointFormer: 3D Point Cloud Analysis via Adapting 2D Visual Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained large-scale models have exhibited remarkable efficacy in computer vision, particularly for 2D image analysis. However, when it comes to 3D point clouds, the constrained accessibility of data, in contrast to the vast repositories of images, poses a challenge for the development of 3D pre-trained models. This paper therefore attempts to directly leverage pre-trained models with 2D prior knowledge to accomplish the tasks for 3D point cloud analysis. Accordingly, we propose the Adaptive PointFormer (APF), which fine-tunes pre-trained 2D models with only a modest number of parameters to directly process point clouds, obviating the need for mapping to images. Specifically, we convert raw point clouds into point embeddings for aligning dimensions with image tokens. Given the inherent disorder in point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of images, we then sequence the point embeddings to optimize the utilization of 2D attention priors. To calibrate attention across 3D and 2D domains and reduce computational overhead, a trainable PointFormer with a limited number of parameters is subsequently concatenated to a frozen pre-trained image model. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed APF. The source code and more details are available at https://vcc.tech/research/2024/PointFormer.</description>

      <title>Research on Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction Mechanism based on Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution reconstruction techniques entail the utilization of software algorithms to transform one or more sets of low-resolution images captured from the same scene into high-resolution images. In recent years, considerable advancement has been observed in the domain of single-image super-resolution algorithms, particularly those based on deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, the extraction of image features and nonlinear mapping methods in the reconstruction process remain challenging for existing algorithms. These issues result in the network architecture being unable to effectively utilize the diverse range of information at different levels. The loss of high-frequency details is significant, and the final reconstructed image features are overly smooth, with a lack of fine texture details. This negatively impacts the subjective visual quality of the image. The objective is to recover high-quality, high-resolution images from low-resolution images. In this work, an enhanced deep convolutional neural network model is employed, comprising multiple convolutional layers, each of which is configured with specific filters and activation functions to effectively capture the diverse features of the image. Furthermore, a residual learning strategy is employed to accelerate training and enhance the convergence of the network, while sub-pixel convolutional layers are utilized to refine the high-frequency details and textures of the image. The experimental analysis demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed model on multiple public datasets when compared with the traditional bicubic interpolation method and several other learning-based super-resolution methods. Furthermore, it proves the model's efficacy in maintaining image edges and textures.</description>

      <title>TXL-PBC: a freely accessible labeled peripheral blood cell dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study, we found that publicly BCCD and BCD datasets have significant issues such as labeling errors, insufficient sample size, and poor data quality. To address these problems, we performed sample deletion, re-labeling, and integration of these two datasets. Additionally, we introduced the PBC and Raabin-WBC datasets, and ultimately created a high-quality, sample-balanced new dataset, which we named TXL-PBC. The dataset contains 1008 training sets, 288 validation sets, and 144 test sets. Firstly, The dataset underwent strict manual annotation, automatic annotation with YOLOv8n model, and manual audit steps to ensure the accuracy and consistency of annotations. Secondly, we addresses the blood cell mislabeling problem of the original datasets. The distribution of label boundary box areas and the number of labels are better than the BCCD and BCD datasets. Moreover, we used the YOLOv8n model to train these three datasets, the performance of the TXL-PBC dataset surpass the original two datasets. Finally, we employed YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5l, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m detection models as the baseline models for TXL-PBC. This study not only enhances the quality of the blood cell dataset but also supports researchers in improving models for blood cell target detection. We published our freely accessible TXL-PBC dataset at https://github.com/lugan113/TXL-PBC\_Dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our solutions for a spectrum of automation tasks in life-saving intervention procedures within the Trauma THOMPSON (T3) Challenge, encompassing action recognition, action anticipation, and Visual Question Answering (VQA). For action recognition and anticipation, we propose a pre-processing strategy that samples and stitches multiple inputs into a single image and then incorporates momentum- and attention-based knowledge distillation to improve the performance of the two tasks. For training, we present an action dictionary-guided design, which consistently yields the most favorable results across our experiments. In the realm of VQA, we leverage object-level features and deploy co-attention networks to train both object and question features. Notably, we introduce a novel frame-question cross-attention mechanism at the network's core for enhanced performance. Our solutions achieve the $2^{nd}$ rank in action recognition and anticipation tasks and $1^{st}$ rank in the VQA task.</description>

      <title>LIDIA: Precise Liver Tumor Diagnosis on Multi-Phase Contrast-Enhanced CT via Iterative Fusion and Asymmetric Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early detection and precise diagnosis of liver tumors are tasks of critical clinical value, yet they pose significant challenges due to the high heterogeneity and variability of liver tumors. In this work, a precise LIver tumor DIAgnosis network on multi-phase contrast-enhance CT, named LIDIA, is proposed for real-world scenario. To fully utilize all available phases in contrast-enhanced CT, LIDIA first employs the iterative fusion module to aggregate variable numbers of image phases, thereby capturing the features of lesions at different phases for better tumor diagnosis. To effectively mitigate the high heterogeneity problem of liver tumors, LIDIA incorporates asymmetric contrastive learning to enhance the discriminability between different classes. To evaluate our method, we constructed a large-scale dataset comprising 1,921 patients and 8,138 lesions. LIDIA has achieved an average AUC of 93.6% across eight different types of lesions, demonstrating its effectiveness. Besides, LIDIA also demonstrated strong generalizability with an average AUC of 89.3% when tested on an external cohort of 828 patients.</description>

      <title>Multi-sentence Video Grounding for Long Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation has witnessed great success recently, but their application in generating long videos still remains challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining the temporal consistency of generated videos and the high memory cost during generation. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose a brave and new idea of Multi-sentence Video Grounding for Long Video Generation, connecting the massive video moment retrieval to the video generation task for the first time, providing a new paradigm for long video generation. The method of our work can be summarized as three steps: (i) We design sequential scene text prompts as the queries for video grounding, utilizing the massive video moment retrieval to search for video moment segments that meet the text requirements in the video database. (ii) Based on the source frames of retrieved video moment segments, we adopt video editing methods to create new video content while preserving the temporal consistency of the retrieved video. Since the editing can be conducted segment by segment, and even frame by frame, it largely reduces the memory cost. (iii) We also attempt video morphing and personalized generation methods to improve the subject consistency of long video generation, providing ablation experimental results for the subtasks of long video generation. Our approach seamlessly extends the development in image/video editing, video morphing and personalized generation, and video grounding to the long video generation, offering effective solutions for generating long videos at low memory cost.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Label Relevance Ranking via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional multi-label recognition methods often focus on label confidence, frequently overlooking the pivotal role of partial order relations consistent with human preference. To resolve these issues, we introduce a novel method for multimodal label relevance ranking, named Label Relevance Ranking with Proximal Policy Optimization (LR\textsuperscript{2}PPO), which effectively discerns partial order relations among labels. LR\textsuperscript{2}PPO first utilizes partial order pairs in the target domain to train a reward model, which aims to capture human preference intrinsic to the specific scenario. Furthermore, we meticulously design state representation and a policy loss tailored for ranking tasks, enabling LR\textsuperscript{2}PPO to boost the performance of label relevance ranking model and largely reduce the requirement of partial order annotation for transferring to new scenes. To assist in the evaluation of our approach and similar methods, we further propose a novel benchmark dataset, LRMovieNet, featuring multimodal labels and their corresponding partial order data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LR\textsuperscript{2}PPO algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, proving its effectiveness in addressing the multimodal label relevance ranking problem. Codes and the proposed LRMovieNet dataset are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ChazzyGordon/LR2PPO}.</description>

      <title>NODER: Image Sequence Regression Based on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regression on medical image sequences can capture temporal image pattern changes and predict images at missing or future time points. However, existing geodesic regression methods limit their regression performance by a strong underlying assumption of linear dynamics, while diffusion-based methods have high computational costs and lack constraints to preserve image topology. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based new framework called NODER, which leverages neural ordinary differential equations to capture complex underlying dynamics and reduces its high computational cost of handling high-dimensional image volumes by introducing the latent space. We compare our NODER with two recent regression methods, and the experimental results on ADNI and ACDC datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in 3D image regression. Our model needs only a couple of images in a sequence for prediction, which is practical, especially for clinical situations where extremely limited image time series are available for analysis. Our source code is available at https://github.com/ZedKing12138/NODER-pytorch.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) tools are increasingly popular in modern dental practice, particularly for treatment planning or comprehensive prognosis evaluation. In particular, the 2D panoramic X-ray image efficiently detects invisible caries, impacted teeth and supernumerary teeth in children, while the 3D dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in orthodontics and endodontics due to its low radiation dose. However, there is no open-access 2D public dataset for children's teeth and no open 3D dental CBCT dataset, which limits the development of automatic algorithms for segmenting teeth and analyzing diseases. The Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation (STS) Challenge, a pioneering event in tooth segmentation, was held as a part of the MICCAI 2023 ToothFairy Workshop on the Alibaba Tianchi platform. This challenge aims to investigate effective semi-supervised tooth segmentation algorithms to advance the field of dentistry. In this challenge, we provide two modalities including the 2D panoramic X-ray images and the 3D CBCT tooth volumes. In Task 1, the goal was to segment tooth regions in panoramic X-ray images of both adult and pediatric teeth. Task 2 involved segmenting tooth sections using CBCT volumes. Limited labelled images with mostly unlabelled ones were provided in this challenge prompt using semi-supervised algorithms for training. In the preliminary round, the challenge received registration and result submission by 434 teams, with 64 advancing to the final round. This paper summarizes the diverse methods employed by the top-ranking teams in the STS MICCAI 2023 Challenge.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Structural Memorization: Structural Membership Inference Attack for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, various practical applications have emerged, bringing significant convenience to society. However, model developers may misuse the unauthorized data to train diffusion models. These data are at risk of being memorized by the models, thus potentially violating citizens' privacy rights. Therefore, in order to judge whether a specific image is utilized as a member of a model's training set, Membership Inference Attack (MIA) is proposed to serve as a tool for privacy protection. Current MIA methods predominantly utilize pixel-wise comparisons as distinguishing clues, considering the pixel-level memorization characteristic of diffusion models. However, it is practically impossible for text-to-image models to memorize all the pixel-level information in massive training sets. Therefore, we move to the more advanced structure-level memorization. Observations on the diffusion process show that the structures of members are better preserved compared to those of nonmembers, indicating that diffusion models possess the capability to remember the structures of member images from training sets. Drawing on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective MIA method tailored for text-to-image diffusion models. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach. Compared to current pixel-level baselines, our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also demonstrates remarkable robustness against various distortions.</description>

      <title>Make a Strong Teacher with Label Assistance: A Novel Knowledge Distillation Approach for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel knowledge distillation approach for the semantic segmentation task. Unlike previous methods that rely on power-trained teachers or other modalities to provide additional knowledge, our approach does not require complex teacher models or information from extra sensors. Specifically, for the teacher model training, we propose to noise the label and then incorporate it into input to effectively boost the lightweight teacher performance. To ensure the robustness of the teacher model against the introduced noise, we propose a dual-path consistency training strategy featuring a distance loss between the outputs of two paths. For the student model training, we keep it consistent with the standard distillation for simplicity. Our approach not only boosts the efficacy of knowledge distillation but also increases the flexibility in selecting teacher and student models. To demonstrate the advantages of our Label Assisted Distillation (LAD) method, we conduct extensive experiments on five challenging datasets including Cityscapes, ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, COCO-Stuff 10K, and COCO-Stuff 164K, five popular models: FCN, PSPNet, DeepLabV3, STDC, and OCRNet, and results show the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. We posit that incorporating labels into the input, as demonstrated in our work, will provide valuable insights into related fields.

      <title>A Dataset and Benchmark for Shape Completion of Fruits for Agricultural Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, our agricultural production system needs to double its productivity despite a decline of human workforce in the agricultural sector. Autonomous robotic systems are one promising pathway to increase productivity by taking over labor-intensive manual tasks like fruit picking. To be effective, such systems need to monitor and interact with plants and fruits precisely, which is challenging due to the cluttered nature of agricultural environments causing, for example, strong occlusions. Thus, being able to estimate the complete 3D shapes of objects in presence of occlusions is crucial for automating operations such as fruit harvesting. In this paper, we propose the first publicly available 3D shape completion dataset for agricultural vision systems. We provide an RGB-D dataset for estimating the 3D shape of fruits. Specifically, our dataset contains RGB-D frames of single sweet peppers in lab conditions but also in a commercial greenhouse. For each fruit, we additionally collected high-precision point clouds that we use as ground truth. For acquiring the ground truth shape, we developed a measuring process that allows us to record data of real sweet pepper plants, both in the lab and in the greenhouse with high precision, and determine the shape of the sensed fruits. We release our dataset, consisting of almost 7000 RGB-D frames belonging to more than 100 different fruits. We provide segmented RGB-D frames, with camera instrinsics to easily obtain colored point clouds, together with the corresponding high-precision, occlusion-free point clouds obtained with a high-precision laser scanner. We additionally enable evaluation ofshape completion approaches on a hidden test set through a public challenge on a benchmark server.</description>

      <title>Exposure Completing for Temporally Consistent Neural High Dynamic Range Video Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) video rendering from low dynamic range (LDR) videos where frames are of alternate exposure encounters significant challenges, due to the exposure change and absence at each time stamp. The exposure change and absence make existing methods generate flickering HDR results. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm to render HDR frames via completing the absent exposure information, hence the exposure information is complete and consistent. Our approach involves interpolating neighbor LDR frames in the time dimension to reconstruct LDR frames for the absent exposures. Combining the interpolated and given LDR frames, the complete set of exposure information is available at each time stamp. This benefits the fusing process for HDR results, reducing noise and ghosting artifacts therefore improving temporal consistency. Extensive experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of absent exposure completing in HDR video rendering.

      <title>General Vision Encoder Features as Guidance in Medical Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General vision encoders like DINOv2 and SAM have recently transformed computer vision. Even though they are trained on natural images, such encoder models have excelled in medical imaging, e.g., in classification, segmentation, and registration. However, no in-depth comparison of different state-of-the-art general vision encoders for medical registration is available. In this work, we investigate how well general vision encoder features can be used in the dissimilarity metrics for medical image registration. We explore two encoders that were trained on natural images as well as one that was fine-tuned on medical data. We apply the features within the well-established B-spline FFD registration framework. In extensive experiments on cardiac cine MRI data, we find that using features as additional guidance for conventional metrics improves the registration quality.

      <title>Fully Test-Time rPPG Estimation via Synthetic Signal-Guided Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimation models have achieved promising performance on the training domain but often fail to measure the physiological signals or heart rates (HR) on test domains. Domain generalization (DG) or domain adaptation (DA) techniques are therefore adopted in the offline training stage to adapt the model to the unobserved or observed test domain by referring to all the available source domain data. However, in rPPG estimation problems, the adapted model usually confronts challenges of estimating target data with various domain information, such as different video capturing settings, individuals of different age ranges, or of different HR distributions. In contrast, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), by online adapting to unlabeled target data without referring to any source data, enables the model to adaptively estimate rPPG signals of various unseen domains. In this paper, we first propose a novel TTA-rPPG benchmark, which encompasses various domain information and HR distributions, to simulate the challenges encountered in rPPG estimation. Next, we propose a novel synthetic signal-guided rPPG estimation framework with a two-fold purpose. First, we design an effective spectral-based entropy minimization to enforce the rPPG model to learn new target domain information. Second, we develop a synthetic signal-guided feature learning, by synthesizing pseudo rPPG signals as pseudo ground-truths to guide a conditional generator to generate latent rPPG features. The synthesized rPPG signals and the generated rPPG features are used to guide the rPPG model to broadly cover various HR distributions. Our extensive experiments on the TTA-rPPG benchmark show that the proposed method achieves superior performance and outperforms previous DG and DA methods across most protocols of the proposed TTA-rPPG benchmark.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Lane Detection via Contextual Contrast and Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on two crucial issues in domain-adaptive lane detection, i.e., how to effectively learn discriminative features and transfer knowledge across domains. Existing lane detection methods usually exploit a pixel-wise cross-entropy loss to train detection models. However, the loss ignores the difference in feature representation among lanes, which leads to inefficient feature learning. On the other hand, cross-domain context dependency crucial for transferring knowledge across domains remains unexplored in existing lane detection methods. This paper proposes a method of Domain-Adaptive lane detection via Contextual Contrast and Aggregation (DACCA), consisting of two key components, i.e., cross-domain contrastive loss and domain-level feature aggregation, to realize domain-adaptive lane detection. The former can effectively differentiate feature representations among categories by taking domain-level features as positive samples. The latter fuses the domain-level and pixel-level features to strengthen cross-domain context dependency. Extensive experiments show that DACCA significantly improves the detection model's performance and outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptive lane detection methods on six datasets, especially achieving the best performance when transferring from CULane to Tusimple (92.10% accuracy), Tusimple to CULane (41.9% F1 score), OpenLane to CULane (43.0% F1 score), and CULane to OpenLane (27.6% F1 score).</description>

      <title>OAT: Object-Level Attention Transformer for Gaze Scanpath Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual search is important in our daily life. The efficient allocation of visual attention is critical to effectively complete visual search tasks. Prior research has predominantly modelled the spatial allocation of visual attention in images at the pixel level, e.g. using a saliency map. However, emerging evidence shows that visual attention is guided by objects rather than pixel intensities. This paper introduces the Object-level Attention Transformer (OAT), which predicts human scanpaths as they search for a target object within a cluttered scene of distractors. OAT uses an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder captures information about the position and appearance of the objects within an image and about the target. The decoder predicts the gaze scanpath as a sequence of object fixations, by integrating output features from both the encoder and decoder. We also propose a new positional encoding that better reflects spatial relationships between objects. We evaluated OAT on the Amazon book cover dataset and a new dataset for visual search that we collected. OAT's predicted gaze scanpaths align more closely with human gaze patterns, compared to predictions by algorithms based on spatial attention on both established metrics and a novel behavioural-based metric. Our results demonstrate the generalization ability of OAT, as it accurately predicts human scanpaths for unseen layouts and target objects.</description>

      <title>Long-Term 3D Point Tracking By Cost Volume Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term point tracking is essential to understand non-rigid motion in the physical world better. Deep learning approaches have recently been incorporated into long-term point tracking, but most prior work predominantly functions in 2D. Although these methods benefit from the well-established backbones and matching frameworks, the motions they produce do not always make sense in the 3D physical world. In this paper, we propose the first deep learning framework for long-term point tracking in 3D that generalizes to new points and videos without requiring test-time fine-tuning. Our model contains a cost volume fusion module that effectively integrates multiple past appearances and motion information via a transformer architecture, significantly enhancing overall tracking performance. In terms of 3D tracking performance, our model significantly outperforms simple scene flow chaining and previous 2D point tracking methods, even if one uses ground truth depth and camera pose to backproject 2D point tracks in a synthetic scenario.</description>

      <title>Learn to Memorize and to Forget: A Continual Learning Perspective of Dynamic SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with implicit neural representations has received extensive attention due to the expressive representation power and the innovative paradigm of continual learning. However, deploying such a system within a dynamic environment has not been well-studied. Such challenges are intractable even for conventional algorithms since observations from different views with dynamic objects involved break the geometric and photometric consistency, whereas the consistency lays the foundation for joint optimizing the camera pose and the map parameters. In this paper, we best exploit the characteristics of continual learning and propose a novel SLAM framework for dynamic environments. While past efforts have been made to avoid catastrophic forgetting by exploiting an experience replay strategy, we view forgetting as a desirable characteristic. By adaptively controlling the replayed buffer, the ambiguity caused by moving objects can be easily alleviated through forgetting. We restrain the replay of the dynamic objects by introducing a continually-learned classifier for dynamic object identification. The iterative optimization of the neural map and the classifier notably improves the robustness of the SLAM system under a dynamic environment. Experiments on challenging datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Deep Learning-Based for Enhanced Occlusion Segmentation in PICU Patient Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote patient monitoring has emerged as a prominent non-invasive method, using digital technologies and computer vision (CV) to replace traditional invasive monitoring. While neonatal and pediatric departments embrace this approach, Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) face the challenge of occlusions hindering accurate image analysis and interpretation. \textit{Objective}: In this study, we propose a hybrid approach to effectively segment common occlusions encountered in remote monitoring applications within PICUs. Our approach centers on creating a deep-learning pipeline for limited training data scenarios. \textit{Methods}: First, a combination of the well-established Google DeepLabV3+ segmentation model with the transformer-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) is devised for occlusion segmentation mask proposal and refinement. We then train and validate this pipeline using a small dataset acquired from real-world PICU settings with a Microsoft Kinect camera, achieving an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metric of 85\%. \textit{Results}: Both quantitative and qualitative analyses underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. The proposed framework yields an overall classification performance with 92.5\% accuracy, 93.8\% recall, 90.3\% precision, and 92.0\% F1-score. Consequently, the proposed method consistently improves the predictions across all metrics, with an average of 2.75\% gain in performance compared to the baseline CNN-based framework. \textit{Conclusions}: Our proposed hybrid approach significantly enhances the segmentation of occlusions in remote patient monitoring within PICU settings. This advancement contributes to improving the quality of care for pediatric patients, addressing a critical need in clinical practice by ensuring more accurate and reliable remote monitoring.</description>

      <title>Implicit Filtering for Learning Neural Signed Distance Functions from 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have shown powerful ability in fitting the shape geometry. However, inferring continuous signed distance fields from discrete unoriented point clouds still remains a challenge. The neural network typically fits the shape with a rough surface and omits fine-grained geometric details such as shape edges and corners. In this paper, we propose a novel non-linear implicit filter to smooth the implicit field while preserving high-frequency geometry details. Our novelty lies in that we can filter the surface (zero level set) by the neighbor input points with gradients of the signed distance field. By moving the input raw point clouds along the gradient, our proposed implicit filtering can be extended to non-zero level sets to keep the promise consistency between different level sets, which consequently results in a better regularization of the zero level set. We conduct comprehensive experiments in surface reconstruction from objects and complex scene point clouds, the numerical and visual comparisons demonstrate our improvements over the state-of-the-art methods under the widely used benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Open Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding via Geometry Guided Self-Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale 3D-text paired data poses a great challenge on open vocabulary 3D scene understanding, and hence it is popular to leverage internet-scale 2D data and transfer their open vocabulary capabilities to 3D models through knowledge distillation. However, the existing distillation-based 3D scene understanding approaches rely on the representation capacity of 2D models, disregarding the exploration of geometric priors and inherent representational advantages offered by 3D data. In this paper, we propose an effective approach, namely Geometry Guided Self-Distillation (GGSD), to learn superior 3D representations from 2D pre-trained models. Specifically, we first design a geometry guided distillation module to distill knowledge from 2D models, and then leverage the 3D geometric priors to alleviate the inherent noise in 2D models and enhance the representation learning process. Due to the advantages of 3D representation, the performance of the distilled 3D student model can significantly surpass that of the 2D teacher model. This motivates us to further leverage the representation advantages of 3D data through self-distillation. As a result, our proposed GGSD approach outperforms the existing open vocabulary 3D scene understanding methods by a large margin, as demonstrated by our experiments on both indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning from the Web: Language Drives Weakly-Supervised Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current weakly-supervised incremental learning for semantic segmentation (WILSS) approaches only consider replacing pixel-level annotations with image-level labels, while the training images are still from well-designed datasets. In this work, we argue that widely available web images can also be considered for the learning of new classes. To achieve this, firstly we introduce a strategy to select web images which are similar to previously seen examples in the latent space using a Fourier-based domain discriminator. Then, an effective caption-driven reharsal strategy is proposed to preserve previously learnt classes. To our knowledge, this is the first work to rely solely on web images for both the learning of new concepts and the preservation of the already learned ones in WILSS. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can reach state-of-the-art performances without using manually selected and annotated data in the incremental steps.</description>

      <title>Affordance Perception by a Knowledge-Guided Vision-Language Model with Efficient Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile robot platforms will increasingly be tasked with activities that involve grasping and manipulating objects in open world environments. Affordance understanding provides a robot with means to realise its goals and execute its tasks, e.g. to achieve autonomous navigation in unknown buildings where it has to find doors and ways to open these. In order to get actionable suggestions, robots need to be able to distinguish subtle differences between objects, as they may result in different action sequences: doorknobs require grasp and twist, while handlebars require grasp and push. In this paper, we improve affordance perception for a robot in an open-world setting. Our contribution is threefold: (1) We provide an affordance representation with precise, actionable affordances; (2) We connect this knowledge base to a foundational vision-language models (VLM) and prompt the VLM for a wider variety of new and unseen objects; (3) We apply a human-in-the-loop for corrections on the output of the VLM. The mix of affordance representation, image detection and a human-in-the-loop is effective for a robot to search for objects to achieve its goals. We have demonstrated this in a scenario of finding various doors and the many different ways to open them.</description>

      <title>Any Image Restoration with Efficient Automatic Degradation Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of mobile devices, there is a growing demand for an efficient model to restore any degraded image for better perceptual quality. However, existing models often require specific learning modules tailored for each degradation, resulting in complex architectures and high computation costs. Different from previous work, in this paper, we propose a unified manner to achieve joint embedding by leveraging the inherent similarities across various degradations for efficient and comprehensive restoration. Specifically, we first dig into the sub-latent space of each input to analyze the key components and reweight their contributions in a gated manner. The intrinsic awareness is further integrated with contextualized attention in an X-shaped scheme, maximizing local-global intertwining. Extensive comparison on benchmarking all-in-one restoration setting validates our efficiency and effectiveness, i.e., our network sets new SOTA records while reducing model complexity by approximately -82% in trainable parameters and -85\% in FLOPs. Our code will be made publicly available at:https://github.com/Amazingren/AnyIR.</description>

      <title>Removing cloud shadows from ground-based solar imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study and prediction of space weather entails the analysis of solar images showing structures of the Sun's atmosphere. When imaged from the Earth's ground, images may be polluted by terrestrial clouds which hinder the detection of solar structures. We propose a new method to remove cloud shadows, based on a U-Net architecture, and compare classical supervision with conditional GAN. We evaluate our method on two different imaging modalities, using both real images and a new dataset of synthetic clouds. Quantitative assessments are obtained through image quality indices (RMSE, PSNR, SSIM, and FID). We demonstrate improved results with regards to the traditional cloud removal technique and a sparse coding baseline, on different cloud types and textures.</description>

      <title>GeometrySticker: Enabling Ownership Claim of Recolorized Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remarkable advancements in the recolorization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have simplified the process of modifying NeRF's color attributes. Yet, with the potential of NeRF to serve as shareable digital assets, there's a concern that malicious users might alter the color of NeRF models and falsely claim the recolorized version as their own. To safeguard against such breaches of ownership, enabling original NeRF creators to establish rights over recolorized NeRF is crucial. While approaches like CopyRNeRF have been introduced to embed binary messages into NeRF models as digital signatures for copyright protection, the process of recolorization can remove these binary messages. In our paper, we present GeometrySticker, a method for seamlessly integrating binary messages into the geometry components of radiance fields, akin to applying a sticker. GeometrySticker can embed binary messages into NeRF models while preserving the effectiveness of these messages against recolorization. Our comprehensive studies demonstrate that GeometrySticker is adaptable to prevalent NeRF architectures and maintains a commendable level of robustness against various distortions.

      <title>Lightweight Uncertainty Quantification with Simplex Semantic Segmentation for Terrain Traversability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For navigation of robots, image segmentation is an important component to determining a terrain's traversability. For safe and efficient navigation, it is key to assess the uncertainty of the predicted segments. Current uncertainty estimation methods are limited to a specific choice of model architecture, are costly in terms of training time, require large memory for inference (ensembles), or involve complex model architectures (energy-based, hyperbolic, masking). In this paper, we propose a simple, light-weight module that can be connected to any pretrained image segmentation model, regardless of its architecture, with marginal additional computation cost because it reuses the model's backbone. Our module is based on maximum separation of the segmentation classes by respective prototype vectors. This optimizes the probability that out-of-distribution segments are projected in between the prototype vectors. The uncertainty value in the classification label is obtained from the distance to the nearest prototype. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our module for terrain segmentation.</description>

      <title>PICASSO: A Feed-Forward Framework for Parametric Inference of CAD Sketches via Rendering Self-Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose PICASSO, a novel framework CAD sketch parameterization from hand-drawn or precise sketch images via rendering self-supervision. Given a drawing of a CAD sketch, the proposed framework turns it into parametric primitives that can be imported into CAD software. Compared to existing methods, PICASSO enables the learning of parametric CAD sketches from either precise or hand-drawn sketch images, even in cases where annotations at the parameter level are scarce or unavailable. This is achieved by leveraging the geometric characteristics of sketches as a learning cue to pre-train a CAD parameterization network. Specifically, PICASSO comprises two primary components: (1) a Sketch Parameterization Network (SPN) that predicts a series of parametric primitives from CAD sketch images, and (2) a Sketch Rendering Network (SRN) that renders parametric CAD sketches in a differentiable manner. SRN facilitates the computation of a image-to-image loss, which can be utilized to pre-train SPN, thereby enabling zero- and few-shot learning scenarios for the parameterization of hand-drawn sketches. Extensive evaluation on the widely used SketchGraphs dataset validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>GDDS: A Single Domain Generalized Defect Detection Frame of Open World Scenario using Gather and Distribute Domain-shift Suppression Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and intelligent surface defect detection of photovoltaic modules is crucial for improving the quality of photovoltaic modules and ensuring the reliable operation of large-scale infrastructure. However, the scenario characteristics of data distribution deviation make the construction of defect detection models for open world scenarios such as photovoltaic manufacturing and power plant inspections a challenge. Therefore, we propose the Gather and Distribute Domain shift Suppression Network (GDDS). It adopts a single domain generalized method that is completely independent of the test samples to address the problem of distribution shift. Using a one-stage network as the baseline network breaks through the limitations of traditional domain generalization methods that typically use two-stage networks. It not only balances detection accuracy and speed but also simplifies the model deployment and application process. The GDDS includes two modules: DeepSpine Module and Gather and Distribute Module. Specifically, the DeepSpine Module applies a wider range of contextual information and suppresses background style shift by acquiring and concatenating multi-scale features. The Gather and Distribute Module collects and distributes global information to achieve cross layer interactive learning of multi-scale channel features and suppress defect instance shift. Furthermore, the GDDS utilizes normalized Wasserstein distance for similarity measurement, reducing measurement errors caused by bounding box position deviations. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of GDDS on the EL endogenous shift dataset and Photovoltaic inspection infrared image dataset. The experimental results showed that GDDS can adapt to defect detection in open world scenarios faster and better than other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>CycleMix: Mixing Source Domains for Domain Generalization in Style-Dependent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As deep learning-based systems have become an integral part of everyday life, limitations in their generalization ability have begun to emerge. Machine learning algorithms typically rely on the i.i.d. assumption, meaning that their training and validation data are expected to follow the same distribution, which does not necessarily hold in practice. In the case of image classification, one frequent reason that algorithms fail to generalize is that they rely on spurious correlations present in training data, such as associating image styles with target classes. These associations may not be present in the unseen test data, leading to significant degradation of their effectiveness. In this work, we attempt to mitigate this Domain Generalization (DG) problem by training a robust feature extractor which disregards features attributed to image-style but infers based on style-invariant image representations. To achieve this, we train CycleGAN models to learn the different styles present in the training data and randomly mix them together to create samples with novel style attributes to improve generalization. Experimental results on the PACS DG benchmark validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>WiNet: Wavelet-based Incremental Learning for Efficient Medical Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep image registration has demonstrated exceptional accuracy and fast inference. Recent advances have adopted either multiple cascades or pyramid architectures to estimate dense deformation fields in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, due to the cascaded nature and repeated composition/warping operations on feature maps, these methods negatively increase memory usage during training and testing. Moreover, such approaches lack explicit constraints on the learning process of small deformations at different scales, thus lacking explainability. In this study, we introduce a model-driven WiNet that incrementally estimates scale-wise wavelet coefficients for the displacement/velocity field across various scales, utilizing the wavelet coefficients derived from the original input image pair. By exploiting the properties of the wavelet transform, these estimated coefficients facilitate the seamless reconstruction of a full-resolution displacement/velocity field via our devised inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) layer. This approach avoids the complexities of cascading networks or composition operations, making our WiNet an explainable and efficient competitor with other coarse-to-fine methods. Extensive experimental results from two 3D datasets show that our WiNet is accurate and GPU efficient. The code is available at https://github.com/x-xc/WiNet .</description>

      <title>FREST: Feature RESToration for Semantic Segmentation under Multiple Adverse Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust semantic segmentation under adverse conditions is crucial in real-world applications. To address this challenging task in practical scenarios where labeled normal condition images are not accessible in training, we propose FREST, a novel feature restoration framework for source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) of semantic segmentation to adverse conditions. FREST alternates two steps: (1) learning the condition embedding space that only separates the condition information from the features and (2) restoring features of adverse condition images on the learned condition embedding space. By alternating these two steps, FREST gradually restores features where the effect of adverse conditions is reduced. FREST achieved a state of the art on two public benchmarks (i.e., ACDC and RobotCar) for SFDA to adverse conditions. Moreover, it shows superior generalization ability on unseen datasets.</description>

      <title>BEAF: Observing BEfore-AFter Changes to Evaluate Hallucination in Vision-language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) perceive the world through a combination of a visual encoder and a large language model (LLM). The visual encoder, pre-trained on large-scale vision-text datasets, provides zero-shot generalization to visual data, and the LLM endows its high reasoning ability to VLMs. It leads VLMs to achieve high performance on wide benchmarks without fine-tuning, exhibiting zero or few-shot capability. However, recent studies show that VLMs are vulnerable to hallucination. This undesirable behavior degrades reliability and credibility, thereby making users unable to fully trust the output from VLMs. To enhance trustworthiness and better tackle the hallucination of VLMs, we curate a new evaluation dataset, called the BEfore-AFter hallucination dataset (BEAF), and introduce new metrics: True Understanding (TU), IGnorance (IG), StuBbornness (SB), and InDecision (ID). Unlike prior works that focus only on constructing questions and answers, the key idea of our benchmark is to manipulate visual scene information by image editing models and to design the metrics based on scene changes. This allows us to clearly assess whether VLMs correctly understand a given scene by observing the ability to perceive changes. We also visualize image-wise object relationship by virtue of our two-axis view: vision and text. Upon evaluating VLMs with our dataset, we observed that our metrics reveal different aspects of VLM hallucination that have not been reported before.

      <title>SA-DVAE: Improving Zero-Shot Skeleton-Based Action Recognition by Disentangled Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition methods utilize projection networks to learn a shared latent space of skeleton features and semantic embeddings. The inherent imbalance in action recognition datasets, characterized by variable skeleton sequences yet constant class labels, presents significant challenges for alignment. To address the imbalance, we propose SA-DVAE -- Semantic Alignment via Disentangled Variational Autoencoders, a method that first adopts feature disentanglement to separate skeleton features into two independent parts -- one is semantic-related and another is irrelevant -- to better align skeleton and semantic features. We implement this idea via a pair of modality-specific variational autoencoders coupled with a total correction penalty. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD, and our experimental results show that SA-DAVE produces improved performance over existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/pha123661/SA-DVAE.</description>

      <title>SCAPE: A Simple and Strong Category-Agnostic Pose Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) aims to localize keypoints on an object of any category given few exemplars in an in-context manner. Prior arts involve sophisticated designs, e.g., sundry modules for similarity calculation and a two-stage framework, or takes in extra heatmap generation and supervision. We notice that CAPE is essentially a task about feature matching, which can be solved within the attention process. Therefore we first streamline the architecture into a simple baseline consisting of several pure self-attention layers and an MLP regression head -- this simplification means that one only needs to consider the attention quality to boost the performance of CAPE. Towards an effective attention process for CAPE, we further introduce two key modules: i) a global keypoint feature perceptor to inject global semantic information into support keypoints, and ii) a keypoint attention refiner to enhance inter-node correlation between keypoints. They jointly form a Simple and strong Category-Agnostic Pose Estimator (SCAPE). Experimental results show that SCAPE outperforms prior arts by 2.2 and 1.3 PCK under 1-shot and 5-shot settings with faster inference speed and lighter model capacity, excelling in both accuracy and efficiency.

      <title>Similarity over Factuality: Are we making progress on multimodal out-of-context misinformation detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation poses a significant challenge in multimodal fact-checking, where images are paired with texts that misrepresent their original context to support false narratives. Recent research in evidence-based OOC detection has seen a trend towards increasingly complex architectures, incorporating Transformers, foundation models, and large language models. In this study, we introduce a simple yet robust baseline, which assesses MUltimodal SimilaritiEs (MUSE), specifically the similarity between image-text pairs and external image and text evidence. Our results demonstrate that MUSE, when used with conventional classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron, can compete with and even surpass the state-of-the-art on the NewsCLIPpings and VERITE datasets. Furthermore, integrating MUSE in our proposed "Attentive Intermediate Transformer Representations" (AITR) significantly improved performance, by 3.3% and 7.5% on NewsCLIPpings and VERITE, respectively. Nevertheless, the success of MUSE, relying on surface-level patterns and shortcuts, without examining factuality and logical inconsistencies, raises critical questions about how we define the task, construct datasets, collect external evidence and overall, how we assess progress in the field. We release our code at: https://github.com/stevejpapad/outcontext-misinfo-progress</description>

      <title>FADE: A Task-Agnostic Upsampling Operator for Encoder-Decoder Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to develop a task-agnostic feature upsampling operator for dense prediction where the operator is required to facilitate not only region-sensitive tasks like semantic segmentation but also detail-sensitive tasks such as image matting. Prior upsampling operators often can work well in either type of the tasks, but not both. We argue that task-agnostic upsampling should dynamically trade off between semantic preservation and detail delineation, instead of having a bias between the two properties. In this paper, we present FADE, a novel, plug-and-play, lightweight, and task-agnostic upsampling operator by fusing the assets of decoder and encoder features at three levels: i) considering both the encoder and decoder feature in upsampling kernel generation; ii) controlling the per-point contribution of the encoder/decoder feature in upsampling kernels with an efficient semi-shift convolutional operator; and iii) enabling the selective pass of encoder features with a decoder-dependent gating mechanism for compensating details. To improve the practicality of FADE, we additionally study parameter- and memory-efficient implementations of semi-shift convolution. We analyze the upsampling behavior of FADE on toy data and show through large-scale experiments that FADE is task-agnostic with consistent performance improvement on a number of dense prediction tasks with little extra cost. For the first time, we demonstrate robust feature upsampling on both region- and detail-sensitive tasks successfully. Code is made available at: https://github.com/poppinace/fade</description>

      <title>Mask2Map: Vectorized HD Map Construction Using Bird's Eye View Segmentation Masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Mask2Map, a novel end-to-end online HD map construction method designed for autonomous driving applications. Our approach focuses on predicting the class and ordered point set of map instances within a scene, represented in the bird's eye view (BEV). Mask2Map consists of two primary components: the Instance-Level Mask Prediction Network (IMPNet) and the Mask-Driven Map Prediction Network (MMPNet). IMPNet generates Mask-Aware Queries and BEV Segmentation Masks to capture comprehensive semantic information globally. Subsequently, MMPNet enhances these query features using local contextual information through two submodules: the Positional Query Generator (PQG) and the Geometric Feature Extractor (GFE). PQG extracts instance-level positional queries by embedding BEV positional information into Mask-Aware Queries, while GFE utilizes BEV Segmentation Masks to generate point-level geometric features. However, we observed limited performance in Mask2Map due to inter-network inconsistency stemming from different predictions to Ground Truth (GT) matching between IMPNet and MMPNet. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Inter-network Denoising Training method, which guides the model to denoise the output affected by both noisy GT queries and perturbed GT Segmentation Masks. Our evaluation conducted on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrates that Mask2Map achieves remarkable performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, with gains of 10.1% mAP and 4.1 mAP, respectively.

      <title>GPSFormer: A Global Perception and Local Structure Fitting-based Transformer for Point Cloud Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in pre-training methods for point cloud understanding, directly capturing intricate shape information from irregular point clouds without reliance on external data remains a formidable challenge. To address this problem, we propose GPSFormer, an innovative Global Perception and Local Structure Fitting-based Transformer, which learns detailed shape information from point clouds with remarkable precision. The core of GPSFormer is the Global Perception Module (GPM) and the Local Structure Fitting Convolution (LSFConv). Specifically, GPM utilizes Adaptive Deformable Graph Convolution (ADGConv) to identify short-range dependencies among similar features in the feature space and employs Multi-Head Attention (MHA) to learn long-range dependencies across all positions within the feature space, ultimately enabling flexible learning of contextual representations. Inspired by Taylor series, we design LSFConv, which learns both low-order fundamental and high-order refinement information from explicitly encoded local geometric structures. Integrating the GPM and LSFConv as fundamental components, we construct GPSFormer, a cutting-edge Transformer that effectively captures global and local structures of point clouds. Extensive experiments validate GPSFormer's effectiveness in three point cloud tasks: shape classification, part segmentation, and few-shot learning. The code of GPSFormer is available at \url{https://github.com/changshuowang/GPSFormer}.</description>

      <title>EaDeblur-GS: Event assisted 3D Deblur Reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D deblurring reconstruction techniques have recently seen significant advancements with the development of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Although these techniques can recover relatively clear 3D reconstructions from blurry image inputs, they still face limitations in handling severe blurring and complex camera motion. To address these issues, we propose Event-assisted 3D Deblur Reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting (EaDeblur-GS), which integrates event camera data to enhance the robustness of 3DGS against motion blur. By employing an Adaptive Deviation Estimator (ADE) network to estimate Gaussian center deviations and using novel loss functions, EaDeblur-GS achieves sharp 3D reconstructions in real-time, demonstrating performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Source-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection with Low-confidence Pseudo Label Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-Free domain adaptive Object Detection (SFOD) is a promising strategy for deploying trained detectors to new, unlabeled domains without accessing source data, addressing significant concerns around data privacy and efficiency. Most SFOD methods leverage a Mean-Teacher (MT) self-training paradigm relying heavily on High-confidence Pseudo Labels (HPL). However, these HPL often overlook small instances that undergo significant appearance changes with domain shifts. Additionally, HPL ignore instances with low confidence due to the scarcity of training samples, resulting in biased adaptation toward familiar instances from the source domain. To address this limitation, we introduce the Low-confidence Pseudo Label Distillation (LPLD) loss within the Mean-Teacher based SFOD framework. This novel approach is designed to leverage the proposals from Region Proposal Network (RPN), which potentially encompasses hard-to-detect objects in unfamiliar domains. Initially, we extract HPL using a standard pseudo-labeling technique and mine a set of Low-confidence Pseudo Labels (LPL) from proposals generated by RPN, leaving those that do not overlap significantly with HPL. These LPL are further refined by leveraging class-relation information and reducing the effect of inherent noise for the LPLD loss calculation. Furthermore, we use feature distance to adaptively weight the LPLD loss to focus on LPL containing a larger foreground area. Our method outperforms previous SFOD methods on four cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LPLD loss leads to effective adaptation by reducing false negatives and facilitating the use of domain-invariant knowledge from the source model.

      <title>GlobalPointer: Large-Scale Plane Adjustment with Bi-Convex Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plane adjustment (PA) is crucial for many 3D applications, involving simultaneous pose estimation and plane recovery. Despite recent advancements, it remains a challenging problem in the realm of multi-view point cloud registration. Current state-of-the-art methods can achieve globally optimal convergence only with good initialization. Furthermore, their high time complexity renders them impractical for large-scale problems. To address these challenges, we first exploit a novel optimization strategy termed \textit{Bi-Convex Relaxation}, which decouples the original problem into two simpler sub-problems, reformulates each sub-problem using a convex relaxation technique, and alternately solves each one until the original problem converges. Building on this strategy, we propose two algorithmic variants for solving the plane adjustment problem, namely \textit{GlobalPointer} and \textit{GlobalPointer++}, based on point-to-plane and plane-to-plane errors, respectively. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method can perform large-scale plane adjustment with linear time complexity, larger convergence region, and robustness to poor initialization, while achieving similar accuracy as prior methods.

      <title>On the Discriminability of Self-Supervised Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved significant success in downstream visual tasks. However, a notable gap still exists between SSL and supervised learning (SL), especially in complex downstream tasks. In this paper, we show that the features learned by SSL methods suffer from the crowding problem, where features of different classes are not distinctly separated, and features within the same class exhibit large intra-class variance. In contrast, SL ensures a clear separation between classes. We analyze this phenomenon and conclude that SSL objectives do not constrain the relationships between different samples and their augmentations. Our theoretical analysis delves into how SSL objectives fail to enforce the necessary constraints between samples and their augmentations, leading to poor performance in complex tasks. We provide a theoretical framework showing that the performance gap between SSL and SL mainly stems from the inability of SSL methods to capture the aggregation of similar augmentations and the separation of dissimilar augmentations. To address this issue, we propose a learnable regulator called Dynamic Semantic Adjuster (DSA). DSA aggregates and separates samples in the feature space while being robust to outliers. Through extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of DSA in enhancing feature aggregation and separation, ultimately closing the performance gap between SSL and SL.</description>

      <title>SAM-Driven Weakly Supervised Nodule Segmentation with Uncertainty-Aware Cross Teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated nodule segmentation is essential for computer-assisted diagnosis in ultrasound images. Nevertheless, most existing methods depend on precise pixel-level annotations by medical professionals, a process that is both costly and labor-intensive. Recently, segmentation foundation models like SAM have shown impressive generalizability on natural images, suggesting their potential as pseudo-labelers. However, accurate prompts remain crucial for their success in medical images. In this work, we devise a novel weakly supervised framework that effectively utilizes the segmentation foundation model to generate pseudo-labels from aspect ration annotations for automatic nodule segmentation. Specifically, we develop three types of bounding box prompts based on scalable shape priors, followed by an adaptive pseudo-label selection module to fully exploit the prediction capabilities of the foundation model for nodules. We also present a SAM-driven uncertainty-aware cross-teaching strategy. This approach integrates SAM-based uncertainty estimation and label-space perturbations into cross-teaching to mitigate the impact of pseudo-label inaccuracies on model training. Extensive experiments on two clinically collected ultrasound datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>PetFace: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Animal Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated animal face identification plays a crucial role in the monitoring of behaviors, conducting of surveys, and finding of lost animals. Despite the advancements in human face identification, the lack of datasets and benchmarks in the animal domain has impeded progress. In this paper, we introduce the PetFace dataset, a comprehensive resource for animal face identification encompassing 257,484 unique individuals across 13 animal families and 319 breed categories, including both experimental and pet animals. This large-scale collection of individuals facilitates the investigation of unseen animal face verification, an area that has not been sufficiently explored in existing datasets due to the limited number of individuals. Moreover, PetFace also has fine-grained annotations such as sex, breed, color, and pattern. We provide multiple benchmarks including re-identification for seen individuals and verification for unseen individuals. The models trained on our dataset outperform those trained on prior datasets, even for detailed breed variations and unseen animal families. Our result also indicates that there is some room to improve the performance of integrated identification on multiple animal families. We hope the PetFace dataset will facilitate animal face identification and encourage the development of non-invasive animal automatic identification methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arabic Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwriting Recognition (HWR) pose unique challenges due to the cursive and context-sensitive nature of the Arabic script. This study introduces Qalam, a novel foundation model designed for Arabic OCR and HWR, built on a SwinV2 encoder and RoBERTa decoder architecture. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of just 0.80% in HWR tasks and 1.18% in OCR tasks. We train Qalam on a diverse dataset, including over 4.5 million images from Arabic manuscripts and a synthetic dataset comprising 60k image-text pairs. Notably, Qalam demonstrates exceptional handling of Arabic diacritics, a critical feature in Arabic scripts. Furthermore, it shows a remarkable ability to process high-resolution inputs, addressing a common limitation in current OCR systems. These advancements underscore Qalam's potential as a leading solution for Arabic script recognition, offering a significant leap in accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>New Capability to Look Up an ASL Sign from a Video Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Looking up an unknown sign in an ASL dictionary can be difficult. Most ASL dictionaries are organized based on English glosses, despite the fact that (1) there is no convention for assigning English-based glosses to ASL signs; and (2) there is no 1-1 correspondence between ASL signs and English words. Furthermore, what if the user does not know either the meaning of the target sign or its possible English translation(s)? Some ASL dictionaries enable searching through specification of articulatory properties, such as handshapes, locations, movement properties, etc. However, this is a cumbersome process and does not always result in successful lookup. Here we describe a new system, publicly shared on the Web, to enable lookup of a video of an ASL sign (e.g., a webcam recording or a clip from a continuous signing video). The user submits a video for analysis and is presented with the five most likely sign matches, in decreasing order of likelihood, so that the user can confirm the selection and then be taken to our ASLLRP Sign Bank entry for that sign. Furthermore, this video lookup is also integrated into our newest version of SignStream(R) software to facilitate linguistic annotation of ASL video data, enabling the user to directly look up a sign in the video being annotated, and, upon confirmation of the match, to directly enter into the annotation the gloss and features of that sign, greatly increasing the efficiency and consistency of linguistic annotations of ASL video data.</description>

      <title>Connecting Consistency Distillation to Score Distillation for Text-to-3D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have significantly improved generation quality, issues like limited level of detail and low fidelity still persist, which requires further improvement. To understand the essence of those issues, we thoroughly analyze current score distillation methods by connecting theories of consistency distillation to score distillation. Based on the insights acquired through analysis, we propose an optimization framework, Guided Consistency Sampling (GCS), integrated with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to alleviate those issues. Additionally, we have observed the persistent oversaturation in the rendered views of generated 3D assets. From experiments, we find that it is caused by unwanted accumulated brightness in 3DGS during optimization. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Brightness-Equalized Generation (BEG) scheme in 3DGS rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates 3D assets with more details and higher fidelity than state-of-the-art methods. The codes are released at https://github.com/LMozart/ECCV2024-GCS-BEG.</description>

      <title>Robust Calibration of Large Vision-Language Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical issue of miscalibration in CLIP-based model adaptation, particularly in the challenging scenario of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, which has been overlooked in the existing literature on CLIP adaptation. We empirically demonstrate that popular CLIP adaptation approaches, such as Adapters, Prompt Learning, and Test-Time Adaptation, substantially degrade the calibration capabilities of the zero-shot baseline in the presence of distributional drift. We identify the increase in logit ranges as the underlying cause of miscalibration of CLIP adaptation methods, contrasting with previous work on calibrating fully-supervised models. Motivated by these observations, we present a simple and model-agnostic solution to mitigate miscalibration, by scaling the logit range of each sample to its zero-shot prediction logits. We explore three different alternatives to achieve this, which can be either integrated during adaptation or directly used at inference time. Comprehensive experiments on popular OOD classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in mitigating miscalibration while maintaining discriminative performance, whose improvements are consistent across the three families of these increasingly popular approaches.

      <description>arXiv:2407.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric feature grid encodings have gained significant attention as an encoding approach for neural fields since they allow for much smaller MLPs, which significantly decreases the inference time of the models. In this work, we propose MeshFeat, a parametric feature encoding tailored to meshes, for which we adapt the idea of multi-resolution feature grids from Euclidean space. We start from the structure provided by the given vertex topology and use a mesh simplification algorithm to construct a multi-resolution feature representation directly on the mesh. The approach allows the usage of small MLPs for neural fields on meshes, and we show a significant speed-up compared to previous representations while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality for texture reconstruction and BRDF representation. Given its intrinsic coupling to the vertices, the method is particularly well-suited for representations on deforming meshes, making it a good fit for object animation.</description>

      <title>EarthMarker: A Visual Prompt Learning Framework for Region-level and Point-level Remote Sensing Imagery Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in visual prompting in the natural image area have allowed users to interact with artificial intelligence (AI) tools through various visual marks such as box, point, and free-form shapes. However, due to the significant difference between the natural and remote sensing (RS) images, existing visual prompting models face challenges in RS scenarios. Moreover, RS MLLMs mainly focus on interpreting image-level RS data and only support interaction with language instruction, restricting flexibility applications in the real world. To address those limitations, a novel visual prompting model named EarthMarker is proposed, which excels in image-level, region-level, and point-level RS imagery interpretation. Specifically, the visual prompts alongside images and text instruction input into the large language model (LLM), adapt models toward specific predictions and tasks. Subsequently, a sharing visual encoding method is introduced to refine multi-scale image features and visual prompt information uniformly. Furthermore, to endow the EarthMarker with versatile multi-granularity visual perception abilities, the cross-domain phased learning strategy is developed, and the disjoint parameters are optimized in a lightweight manner by leveraging both the natural and RS domain-specific knowledge. In addition, to tackle the lack of RS visual prompting data, a dataset named RSVP featuring multi-modal fine-grained visual prompting instruction is constructed. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the proposed EarthMarker's competitive performance, representing a significant advance in multi-granularity RS imagery interpretation under the visual prompting learning framework.</description>

      <title>Training-free Composite Scene Generation for Layout-to-Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly advanced the generation of high-fidelity, photo-realistic images from textual descriptions. Yet, these models often struggle with interpreting spatial arrangements from text, hindering their ability to produce images with precise spatial configurations. To bridge this gap, layout-to-image generation has emerged as a promising direction. However, training-based approaches are limited by the need for extensively annotated datasets, leading to high data acquisition costs and a constrained conceptual scope. Conversely, training-free methods face challenges in accurately locating and generating semantically similar objects within complex compositions. This paper introduces a novel training-free approach designed to overcome adversarial semantic intersections during the diffusion conditioning phase. By refining intra-token loss with selective sampling and enhancing the diffusion process with attention redistribution, we propose two innovative constraints: 1) an inter-token constraint that resolves token conflicts to ensure accurate concept synthesis; and 2) a self-attention constraint that improves pixel-to-pixel relationships. Our evaluations confirm the effectiveness of leveraging layout information for guiding the diffusion process, generating content-rich images with enhanced fidelity and complexity.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning-based imaging tools across various clinical sites poses significant challenges due to inherent domain shifts and regulatory hurdles associated with site-specific fine-tuning. For histopathology, stain normalization techniques can mitigate discrepancies, but they often fall short of eliminating inter-site variations. Therefore, we present Data Alchemy, an explainable stain normalization method combined with test time data calibration via a template learning framework to overcome barriers in cross-site analysis. Data Alchemy handles shifts inherent to multi-site data and minimizes them without needing to change the weights of the normalization or classifier networks. Our approach extends to unseen sites in various clinical settings where data domain discrepancies are unknown. Extensive experiments highlight the efficacy of our framework in tumor classification in hematoxylin and eosin-stained patches. Our explainable normalization method boosts classification tasks' area under the precision-recall curve(AUPR) by 0.165, 0.545 to 0.710. Additionally, Data Alchemy further reduces the multisite classification domain gap, by improving the 0.710 AUPR an additional 0.142, elevating classification performance further to 0.852, from 0.545. Our Data Alchemy framework can popularize precision medicine with minimal operational overhead by allowing for the seamless integration of pre-trained deep learning-based clinical tools across multiple sites.</description>

      <title>Beyond Augmentation: Empowering Model Robustness under Extreme Capture Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Person Re-identification (re-ID) in computer vision aims to recognize and track individuals across different cameras. While previous research has mainly focused on challenges like pose variations and lighting changes, the impact of extreme capture conditions is often not adequately addressed. These extreme conditions, including varied lighting, camera styles, angles, and image distortions, can significantly affect data distribution and re-ID accuracy.
  Current research typically improves model generalization under normal shooting conditions through data augmentation techniques such as adjusting brightness and contrast. However, these methods pay less attention to the robustness of models under extreme shooting conditions. To tackle this, we propose a multi-mode synchronization learning (MMSL) strategy . This approach involves dividing images into grids, randomly selecting grid blocks, and applying data augmentation methods like contrast and brightness adjustments. This process introduces diverse transformations without altering the original image structure, helping the model adapt to extreme variations. This method improves the model's generalization under extreme conditions and enables learning diverse features, thus better addressing the challenges in re-ID. Extensive experiments on a simulated test set under extreme conditions have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. This approach is crucial for enhancing model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios, supporting the future development of person re-identification technology.</description>

      <title>Open-Vocabulary 3D Semantic Segmentation with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models which are pre-trained on large-scale image-caption pairs for open-vocabulary 3D semantic understanding. We propose a novel method, namely Diff2Scene, which leverages frozen representations from text-image generative models, along with salient-aware and geometric-aware masks, for open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation and visual grounding tasks. Diff2Scene gets rid of any labeled 3D data and effectively identifies objects, appearances, materials, locations and their compositions in 3D scenes. We show that it outperforms competitive baselines and achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. In particular, Diff2Scene improves the state-of-the-art method on ScanNet200 by 12%.</description>

      <title>Beyond Dropout: Robust Convolutional Neural Networks Based on Local Feature Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the contemporary of deep learning, where models often grapple with the challenge of simultaneously achieving robustness against adversarial attacks and strong generalization capabilities, this study introduces an innovative Local Feature Masking (LFM) strategy aimed at fortifying the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on both fronts. During the training phase, we strategically incorporate random feature masking in the shallow layers of CNNs, effectively alleviating overfitting issues, thereby enhancing the model's generalization ability and bolstering its resilience to adversarial attacks. LFM compels the network to adapt by leveraging remaining features to compensate for the absence of certain semantic features, nurturing a more elastic feature learning mechanism. The efficacy of LFM is substantiated through a series of quantitative and qualitative assessments, collectively showcasing a consistent and significant improvement in CNN's generalization ability and resistance against adversarial attacks--a phenomenon not observed in current and prior methodologies. The seamless integration of LFM into established CNN frameworks underscores its potential to advance both generalization and adversarial robustness within the deep learning paradigm. Through comprehensive experiments, including robust person re-identification baseline generalization experiments and adversarial attack experiments, we demonstrate the substantial enhancements offered by LFM in addressing the aforementioned challenges. This contribution represents a noteworthy stride in advancing robust neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>MeshSegmenter: Zero-Shot Mesh Semantic Segmentation via Texture Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MeshSegmenter, a simple yet effective framework designed for zero-shot 3D semantic segmentation. This model successfully extends the powerful capabilities of 2D segmentation models to 3D meshes, delivering accurate 3D segmentation across diverse meshes and segment descriptions. Specifically, our model leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) model to segment the target regions from images rendered from the 3D shape. In light of the importance of the texture for segmentation, we also leverage the pretrained stable diffusion model to generate images with textures from 3D shape, and leverage SAM to segment the target regions from images with textures. Textures supplement the shape for segmentation and facilitate accurate 3D segmentation even in geometrically non-prominent areas, such as segmenting a car door within a car mesh. To achieve the 3D segments, we render 2D images from different views and conduct segmentation for both textured and untextured images. Lastly, we develop a multi-view revoting scheme that integrates 2D segmentation results and confidence scores from various views onto the 3D mesh, ensuring the 3D consistency of segmentation results and eliminating inaccuracies from specific perspectives. Through these innovations, MeshSegmenter offers stable and reliable 3D segmentation results both quantitatively and qualitatively, highlighting its potential as a transformative tool in the field of 3D zero-shot segmentation.

      <title>PASTA: Controllable Part-Aware Shape Generation with Autoregressive Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased demand for tools that automate the 3D content creation process led to tremendous progress in deep generative models that can generate diverse 3D objects of high fidelity. In this paper, we present PASTA, an autoregressive transformer architecture for generating high quality 3D shapes. PASTA comprises two main components: An autoregressive transformer that generates objects as a sequence of cuboidal primitives and a blending network, implemented with a transformer decoder that composes the sequences of cuboids and synthesizes high quality meshes for each object. Our model is trained in two stages: First we train our autoregressive generative model using only annotated cuboidal parts as supervision and next, we train our blending network using explicit 3D supervision, in the form of watertight meshes. Evaluations on various ShapeNet objects showcase the ability of our model to perform shape generation from diverse inputs \eg from scratch, from a partial object, from text and images, as well size-guided generation, by explicitly conditioning on a bounding box that defines the object's boundaries. Moreover, as our model considers the underlying part-based structure of a 3D object, we are able to select a specific part and produce shapes with meaningful variations of this part. As evidenced by our experiments, our model generates 3D shapes that are both more realistic and diverse than existing part-based and non part-based methods, while at the same time is simpler to implement and train.</description>

      <title>HPix: Generating Vector Maps from Satellite Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector maps find widespread utility across diverse domains due to their capacity to not only store but also represent discrete data boundaries such as building footprints, disaster impact analysis, digitization, urban planning, location points, transport links, and more. Although extensive research exists on identifying building footprints and road types from satellite imagery, the generation of vector maps from such imagery remains an area with limited exploration. Furthermore, conventional map generation techniques rely on labor-intensive manual feature extraction or rule-based approaches, which impose inherent limitations. To surmount these limitations, we propose a novel method called HPix, which utilizes modified Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate vector tile map from satellite images. HPix incorporates two hierarchical frameworks: one operating at the global level and the other at the local level, resulting in a comprehensive model. Through empirical evaluations, our proposed approach showcases its effectiveness in producing highly accurate and visually captivating vector tile maps derived from satellite images. We further extend our study's application to include mapping of road intersections and building footprints cluster based on their area.</description>

      <title>Cross-Task Attack: A Self-Supervision Generative Framework Based on Attention Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on artificial intelligence (AI) systems helps discover model shortcomings, enabling the construction of a more robust system. Most existing adversarial attack methods only concentrate on single-task single-model or single-task cross-model scenarios, overlooking the multi-task characteristic of artificial intelligence systems. As a result, most of the existing attacks do not pose a practical threat to a comprehensive and collaborative AI system. However, implementing cross-task attacks is highly demanding and challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining the real labels of different tasks for the same picture and harmonizing the loss functions across different tasks. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised Cross-Task Attack framework (CTA), which utilizes co-attention and anti-attention maps to generate cross-task adversarial perturbation. Specifically, the co-attention map reflects the area to which different visual task models pay attention, while the anti-attention map reflects the area that different visual task models neglect. CTA generates cross-task perturbations by shifting the attention area of samples away from the co-attention map and closer to the anti-attention map. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple vision tasks and the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design for adversarial attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of semantic and covariate out-of-distribution (OOD) examples is a critical yet overlooked challenge in digital pathology (DP). Recently, substantial insight and methods on OOD detection were presented by the ML community, but how do they fare in DP applications? To this end, we establish a benchmark study, our highlights being: 1) the adoption of proper evaluation protocols, 2) the comparison of diverse detectors in both a single and multi-model setting, and 3) the exploration into advanced ML settings like transfer learning (ImageNet vs. DP pre-training) and choice of architecture (CNNs vs. transformers). Through our comprehensive experiments, we contribute new insights and guidelines, paving the way for future research and discussion.</description>

      <title>Attention Based Simple Primitives for Open World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to predict unknown compositions made up of attribute and object pairs. Predicting compositions unseen during training is a challenging task. We are exploring Open World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (OW-CZSL) in this study, where our test space encompasses all potential combinations of attributes and objects. Our approach involves utilizing the self-attention mechanism between attributes and objects to achieve better generalization from seen to unseen compositions. Utilizing a self-attention mechanism facilitates the model's ability to identify relationships between attribute and objects. The similarity between the self-attended textual and visual features is subsequently calculated to generate predictions during the inference phase. The potential test space may encompass implausible object-attribute combinations arising from unrestricted attribute-object pairings. To mitigate this issue, we leverage external knowledge from ConceptNet to restrict the test space to realistic compositions. Our proposed model, Attention-based Simple Primitives (ASP), demonstrates competitive performance, achieving results comparable to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>HazeCLIP: Towards Language Guided Real-World Image Dehazing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods have achieved remarkable performance in single image dehazing, particularly on synthetic datasets. However, they often struggle with real-world hazy images due to domain shift, limiting their practical applicability. This paper introduces HazeCLIP, a language-guided adaptation framework designed to enhance the real-world performance of pre-trained dehazing networks. Inspired by the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model's ability to distinguish between hazy and clean images, we utilize it to evaluate dehazing results. Combined with a region-specific dehazing technique and tailored prompt sets, CLIP model accurately identifies hazy areas, providing a high-quality, human-like prior that guides the fine-tuning process of pre-trained networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HazeCLIP achieves the state-of-the-art performance in real-word image dehazing, evaluated through both visual quality and no-reference quality assessments.

      <title>MaRINeR: Enhancing Novel Views by Matching Rendered Images with Nearby References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rendering realistic images from 3D reconstruction is an essential task of many Computer Vision and Robotics pipelines, notably for mixed-reality applications as well as training autonomous agents in simulated environments. However, the quality of novel views heavily depends of the source reconstruction which is often imperfect due to noisy or missing geometry and appearance. Inspired by the recent success of reference-based super-resolution networks, we propose MaRINeR, a refinement method that leverages information of a nearby mapping image to improve the rendering of a target viewpoint. We first establish matches between the raw rendered image of the scene geometry from the target viewpoint and the nearby reference based on deep features, followed by hierarchical detail transfer. We show improved renderings in quantitative metrics and qualitative examples from both explicit and implicit scene representations. We further employ our method on the downstream tasks of pseudo-ground-truth validation, synthetic data enhancement and detail recovery for renderings of reduced 3D reconstructions.</description>

      <title>General Geometry-aware Weakly Supervised 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D object detection is an indispensable component for scene understanding. However, the annotation of large-scale 3D datasets requires significant human effort. To tackle this problem, many methods adopt weakly supervised 3D object detection that estimates 3D boxes by leveraging 2D boxes and scene/class-specific priors. However, these approaches generally depend on sophisticated manual priors, which is hard to generalize to novel categories and scenes. In this paper, we are motivated to propose a general approach, which can be easily adapted to new scenes and/or classes. A unified framework is developed for learning 3D object detectors from RGB images and associated 2D boxes. In specific, we propose three general components: prior injection module to obtain general object geometric priors from LLM model, 2D space projection constraint to minimize the discrepancy between the boundaries of projected 3D boxes and their corresponding 2D boxes on the image plane, and 3D space geometry constraint to build a Point-to-Box alignment loss to further refine the pose of estimated 3D boxes. Experiments on KITTI and SUN-RGBD datasets demonstrate that our method yields surprisingly high-quality 3D bounding boxes with only 2D annotation.

      <description>arXiv:2407.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the task of identifying situations of distracted driving through analysis of in-car videos. To tackle this challenge we introduce a multi-task video transformer that predicts both distracted actions and driver pose. Leveraging VideoMAEv2, a large pre-trained architecture, our approach incorporates semantic information from human keypoint locations to enhance action recognition and decrease computational overhead by minimizing the number of spatio-temporal tokens. By guiding token selection with pose and class information, we notably reduce the model's computational requirements while preserving the baseline accuracy. Our model surpasses existing state-of-the art results in driver action recognition while exhibiting superior efficiency compared to current video transformer-based approaches.</description>

      <title>LogoSticker: Inserting Logos into Diffusion Models for Customized Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image model customization have underscored the importance of integrating new concepts with a few examples. Yet, these progresses are largely confined to widely recognized subjects, which can be learned with relative ease through models' adequate shared prior knowledge. In contrast, logos, characterized by unique patterns and textual elements, are hard to establish shared knowledge within diffusion models, thus presenting a unique challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce the task of logo insertion. Our goal is to insert logo identities into diffusion models and enable their seamless synthesis in varied contexts. We present a novel two-phase pipeline LogoSticker to tackle this task. First, we propose the actor-critic relation pre-training algorithm, which addresses the nontrivial gaps in models' understanding of the potential spatial positioning of logos and interactions with other objects. Second, we propose a decoupled identity learning algorithm, which enables precise localization and identity extraction of logos. LogoSticker can generate logos accurately and harmoniously in diverse contexts. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of LogoSticker over customization methods and large models such as DALLE~3. \href{https://mingkangz.github.io/logosticker}{Project page}.</description>

Traditional diagnostic methods rely on subjective assessments, necessitating objective approaches for accurate diagnosis. Our study investigates the use of facial action units (AUs) and emotions as biomarkers for depression. We analyzed facial expressions from video data of participants classified with or without depression. Our methodology involved detailed feature extraction, mean intensity comparisons of key AUs, and the application of time series classification models. Furthermore, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and various clustering algorithms to explore the variability in emotional expression patterns. Results indicate significant differences in the intensities of AUs associated with sadness and happiness between the groups, highlighting the potential of facial analysis in depression assessment.</description>

      <title>Streetscapes: Large-scale Consistent Street View Generation Using Autoregressive Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for generating Streetscapes-long sequences of views through an on-the-fly synthesized city-scale scene. Our generation is conditioned by language input (e.g., city name, weather), as well as an underlying map/layout hosting the desired trajectory. Compared to recent models for video generation or 3D view synthesis, our method can scale to much longer-range camera trajectories, spanning several city blocks, while maintaining visual quality and consistency. To achieve this goal, we build on recent work on video diffusion, used within an autoregressive framework that can easily scale to long sequences. In particular, we introduce a new temporal imputation method that prevents our autoregressive approach from drifting from the distribution of realistic city imagery. We train our Streetscapes system on a compelling source of data-posed imagery from Google Street View, along with contextual map data-which allows users to generate city views conditioned on any desired city layout, with controllable camera poses.

      <title>SegPoint: Segment Any Point Cloud via Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D point cloud segmentation, existing methods primarily address specific tasks and depend on explicit instructions to identify targets, lacking the capability to infer and understand implicit user intentions in a unified framework. In this work, we propose a model, called SegPoint, that leverages the reasoning capabilities of a multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM) to produce point-wise segmentation masks across a diverse range of tasks: 1) 3D instruction segmentation, 2) 3D referring segmentation, 3) 3D semantic segmentation, and 4) 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To advance 3D instruction research, we introduce a new benchmark, Instruct3D, designed to evaluate segmentation performance from complex and implicit instructional texts, featuring 2,565 point cloud-instruction pairs. Our experimental results demonstrate that SegPoint achieves competitive performance on established benchmarks such as ScanRefer for referring segmentation and ScanNet for semantic segmentation, while delivering outstanding outcomes on the Instruct3D dataset. To our knowledge, SegPoint is the first model to address these varied segmentation tasks within a single framework, achieving satisfactory performance.</description>

      <title>Shape of Motion: 4D Reconstruction from a Single Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular dynamic reconstruction is a challenging and long-standing vision problem due to the highly ill-posed nature of the task. Existing approaches are limited in that they either depend on templates, are effective only in quasi-static scenes, or fail to model 3D motion explicitly. In this work, we introduce a method capable of reconstructing generic dynamic scenes, featuring explicit, full-sequence-long 3D motion, from casually captured monocular videos. We tackle the under-constrained nature of the problem with two key insights: First, we exploit the low-dimensional structure of 3D motion by representing scene motion with a compact set of SE3 motion bases. Each point's motion is expressed as a linear combination of these bases, facilitating soft decomposition of the scene into multiple rigidly-moving groups. Second, we utilize a comprehensive set of data-driven priors, including monocular depth maps and long-range 2D tracks, and devise a method to effectively consolidate these noisy supervisory signals, resulting in a globally consistent representation of the dynamic scene. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for both long-range 3D/2D motion estimation and novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes.

      <title>Visual Haystacks: Answering Harder Questions About Sets of Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in the field of single-image visual question answering. However, these models face substantial challenges when tasked with queries that span extensive collections of images, similar to real-world scenarios like searching through large photo albums, finding specific information across the internet, or monitoring environmental changes through satellite imagery. This paper explores the task of Multi-Image Visual Question Answering (MIQA): given a large set of images and a natural language query, the task is to generate a relevant and grounded response. We propose a new public benchmark, dubbed "Visual Haystacks (VHs)," specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' capabilities in visual retrieval and reasoning over sets of unrelated images, where we perform comprehensive evaluations demonstrating that even robust closed-source models struggle significantly. Towards addressing these shortcomings, we introduce MIRAGE (Multi-Image Retrieval Augmented Generation), a novel retrieval/QA framework tailored for LMMs that confronts the challenges of MIQA with marked efficiency and accuracy improvements over baseline methods. Our evaluation shows that MIRAGE surpasses closed-source GPT-4o models by up to 11% on the VHs benchmark and offers up to 3.4x improvements in efficiency over text-focused multi-stage approaches.</description>

      <title>Addressing Imbalance for Class Incremental Learning in Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks have made significant breakthroughs in medical image classification, under the assumption that training samples from all classes are simultaneously available. However, in real-world medical scenarios, there's a common need to continuously learn about new diseases, leading to the emerging field of class incremental learning (CIL) in the medical domain. Typically, CIL suffers from catastrophic forgetting when trained on new classes. This phenomenon is mainly caused by the imbalance between old and new classes, and it becomes even more challenging with imbalanced medical datasets. In this work, we introduce two simple yet effective plug-in methods to mitigate the adverse effects of the imbalance. First, we propose a CIL-balanced classification loss to mitigate the classifier bias toward majority classes via logit adjustment. Second, we propose a distribution margin loss that not only alleviates the inter-class overlap in embedding space but also enforces the intra-class compactness. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (CCH5000, HAM10000, and EyePACS). The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Model Merging for Multi-target Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study multi-target domain adaptation of scene understanding models. While previous methods achieved commendable results through inter-domain consistency losses, they often assumed unrealistic simultaneous access to images from all target domains, overlooking constraints such as data transfer bandwidth limitations and data privacy concerns. Given these challenges, we pose the question: How to merge models adapted independently on distinct domains while bypassing the need for direct access to training data? Our solution to this problem involves two components, merging model parameters and merging model buffers (i.e., normalization layer statistics). For merging model parameters, empirical analyses of mode connectivity surprisingly reveal that linear merging suffices when employing the same pretrained backbone weights for adapting separate models. For merging model buffers, we model the real-world distribution with a Gaussian prior and estimate new statistics from the buffers of separately trained models. Our method is simple yet effective, achieving comparable performance with data combination training baselines, while eliminating the need for accessing training data.

      <title>GroupMamba: Parameter-Efficient and Accurate Group Visual State Space Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in state-space models (SSMs) have showcased effective performance in modeling long-range dependencies with subquadratic complexity. However, pure SSM-based models still face challenges related to stability and achieving optimal performance on computer vision tasks. Our paper addresses the challenges of scaling SSM-based models for computer vision, particularly the instability and inefficiency of large model sizes. To address this, we introduce a Modulated Group Mamba layer which divides the input channels into four groups and applies our proposed SSM-based efficient Visual Single Selective Scanning (VSSS) block independently to each group, with each VSSS block scanning in one of the four spatial directions. The Modulated Group Mamba layer also wraps the four VSSS blocks into a channel modulation operator to improve cross-channel communication. Furthermore, we introduce a distillation-based training objective to stabilize the training of large models, leading to consistent performance gains. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the merits of the proposed contributions, leading to superior performance over existing methods for image classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection, instance segmentation on MS-COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our tiny variant with 23M parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance with a classification top-1 accuracy of 83.3% on ImageNet-1K, while being 26% efficient in terms of parameters, compared to the best existing Mamba design of same model size.

      <description>arXiv:2407.12792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose C-LAIfO, a computationally efficient algorithm designed for imitation learning from videos, even in the presence of visual mismatch between agent and expert domains. We analyze the problem of imitation from expert videos with visual discrepancies, and introduce a solution for robust latent space estimation using contrastive learning and data augmentation. Provided a visually robust latent space, our algorithm performs imitation entirely within this space using off-policy adversarial imitation learning. We conduct a thorough ablation study to justify our design choices and test C-LAIfO on high-dimensional continuous robotic tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how C-LAIfO can be combined with other reward signals to facilitate learning on a set of challenging hand manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. Our experiments show improved performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of C-LAIfO. To ensure reproducibility, we provide open access to our code.</description>

Abstract: With the ongoing rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems in high-stakes domains, ensuring the trustworthiness, safety, and observability of these systems has become crucial. It is essential to evaluate and monitor AI systems not only for accuracy and quality-related metrics but also for robustness, bias, security, interpretability, and other responsible AI dimensions. We focus on large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI models, which present additional challenges such as hallucinations, harmful and manipulative content, and copyright infringement. In this survey article accompanying our KDD 2024 tutorial, we highlight a wide range of harms associated with generative AI systems, and survey state of the art approaches (along with open challenges) to address these harms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing deep learning-based surrogate models facilitate efficient data generation, but fall short in uncertainty quantification, efficient parameter space exploration, and reverse prediction. In our work, we introduce SurroFlow, a novel normalizing flow-based surrogate model, to learn the invertible transformation between simulation parameters and simulation outputs. The model not only allows accurate predictions of simulation outcomes for a given simulation parameter but also supports uncertainty quantification in the data generation process. Additionally, it enables efficient simulation parameter recommendation and exploration. We integrate SurroFlow and a genetic algorithm as the backend of a visual interface to support effective user-guided ensemble simulation exploration and visualization. Our framework significantly reduces the computational costs while enhancing the reliability and exploration capabilities of scientific surrogate models.</description>

      <title>KiGRAS: Kinematic-Driven Generative Model for Realistic Agent Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory generation is a pivotal task in autonomous driving. Recent studies have introduced the autoregressive paradigm, leveraging the state transition model to approximate future trajectory distributions. This paradigm closely mirrors the real-world trajectory generation process and has achieved notable success. However, its potential is limited by the ineffective representation of realistic trajectories within the redundant state space. To address this limitation, we propose the Kinematic-Driven Generative Model for Realistic Agent Simulation (KiGRAS). Instead of modeling in the state space, KiGRAS factorizes the driving scene into action probability distributions at each time step, providing a compact space to represent realistic driving patterns. By establishing physical causality from actions (cause) to trajectories (effect) through the kinematic model, KiGRAS eliminates massive redundant trajectories. All states derived from actions in the cause space are constrained to be physically feasible. Furthermore, redundant trajectories representing identical action sequences are mapped to the same representation, reflecting their underlying actions. This approach significantly reduces task complexity and ensures physical feasibility. KiGRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in Waymo's SimAgents Challenge, ranking first on the WOMD leaderboard with significantly fewer parameters than other models. The video documentation is available at \url{https://kigras-mach.github.io/KiGRAS/}.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Veil of Similarity: Quantifying Semantic Continuity in Explainable AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel metric for measuring semantic continuity in Explainable AI methods and machine learning models. We posit that for models to be truly interpretable and trustworthy, similar inputs should yield similar explanations, reflecting a consistent semantic understanding. By leveraging XAI techniques, we assess semantic continuity in the task of image recognition. We conduct experiments to observe how incremental changes in input affect the explanations provided by different XAI methods. Through this approach, we aim to evaluate the models' capability to generalize and abstract semantic concepts accurately and to evaluate different XAI methods in correctly capturing the model behaviour. This paper contributes to the broader discourse on AI interpretability by proposing a quantitative measure for semantic continuity for XAI methods, offering insights into the models' and explainers' internal reasoning processes, and promoting more reliable and transparent AI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While rendering and animation of photorealistic 3D human body models have matured and reached an impressive quality over the past years, modeling the spatial audio associated with such full body models has been largely ignored so far. In this work, we present a framework that allows for high-quality spatial audio generation, capable of rendering the full 3D soundfield generated by a human body, including speech, footsteps, hand-body interactions, and others. Given a basic audio-visual representation of the body in form of 3D body pose and audio from a head-mounted microphone, we demonstrate that we can render the full acoustic scene at any point in 3D space efficiently and accurately. To enable near-field and realtime rendering of sound, we borrow the idea of volumetric primitives from graphical neural rendering and transfer them into the acoustic domain. Our acoustic primitives result in an order of magnitude smaller soundfield representations and overcome deficiencies in near-field rendering compared to previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Denoising of OCT Images Using Residual U-Net: A Cross-Modality Approach on PSOCT and ASOCT for Clinical Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging is pivotal in diagnosing ophthalmic conditions by providing detailed cross-sectional images of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye. Nonetheless, speckle noise and other imaging artifacts inherent to OCT impede the accuracy of diagnosis significantly. In this study, we proposed an enhanced denoising model using a Residual U-Net architecture that effectively diminishes noise and improves image clarity across both Anterior Segment OCT (ASOCT) and polarization-sensitive OCT (PSOCT) images. Our approach demonstrated substantial improvements in image quality metrics: the Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) was 34.343 $\pm$ 1.113 for PSOCT images, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values were 0.885 $\pm$ 0.030, indicating enhanced preservation of tissue integrity and textural details. For ASOCT images, we observed the PSNR to be 23.525 $\pm$ 0.872 dB and SSIM 0.407 $\pm$ 0.044, reflecting significant enhancements in visual quality and structural accuracy. These metrics substantiate the models efficacy in not only reducing noise but also in maintaining crucial anatomical features, thereby enabling more precise and efficient clinical evaluations. The dual functionality across both ASOCT and PSOCT modalities underscores the versatility and potential for broad application in clinical settings, optimizing diagnostic processes and reducing the necessity for prolonged imaging sessions.</description>

      <title>CC-DCNet: Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network with Contrastive Constraints for Identifying Lung Cancer Subtypes on Multi-modality Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate diagnosis of pathological subtypes of lung cancer is of paramount importance for follow-up treatments and prognosis managements. Assessment methods utilizing deep learning technologies have introduced novel approaches for clinical diagnosis. However, the majority of existing models rely solely on single-modality image input, leading to limited diagnostic accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning network designed to accurately classify lung cancer subtype with multi-dimensional and multi-modality images, i.e., CT and pathological images. The strength of the proposed model lies in its ability to dynamically process both paired CT-pathological image sets as well as independent CT image sets, and consequently optimize the pathology-related feature extractions from CT images. This adaptive learning approach enhances the flexibility in processing multi-dimensional and multi-modality datasets and results in performance elevating in the model testing phase. We also develop a contrastive constraint module, which quantitatively maps the cross-modality associations through network training, and thereby helps to explore the "gold standard" pathological information from the corresponding CT scans. To evaluate the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalization ability of our model, we conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale multi-center dataset and compared our model with a series of state-of-the-art classification models. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of our model for lung cancer subtype classification, showcasing significant improvements in accuracy metrics such as ACC, AUC, and F1-score.</description>

      <title>PG-Attack: A Precision-Guided Adversarial Attack Framework Against Vision Foundation Models for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision foundation models are increasingly employed in autonomous driving systems due to their advanced capabilities. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks to the reliability and safety of autonomous vehicles. Adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the vehicle's perception of its surroundings, leading to erroneous decisions and potentially catastrophic consequences. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Precision-Guided Adversarial Attack (PG-Attack) framework that combines two techniques: Precision Mask Perturbation Attack (PMP-Attack) and Deceptive Text Patch Attack (DTP-Attack). PMP-Attack precisely targets the attack region to minimize the overall perturbation while maximizing its impact on the target object's representation in the model's feature space. DTP-Attack introduces deceptive text patches that disrupt the model's understanding of the scene, further enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Our experiments demonstrate that PG-Attack successfully deceives a variety of advanced multi-modal large models, including GPT-4V, Qwen-VL, and imp-V1. Additionally, we won First-Place in the CVPR 2024 Workshop Challenge: Black-box Adversarial Attacks on Vision Foundation Models and codes are available at https://github.com/fuhaha824/PG-Attack.</description>

      <title>LSD3K: A Benchmark for Smoke Removal from Laparoscopic Surgery Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smoke generated by surgical instruments during laparoscopic surgery can obscure the visual field, impairing surgeons' ability to perform operations accurately and safely. Thus, smoke removal task for laparoscopic images is highly desirable. Despite laparoscopic image desmoking has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years and several algorithms have emerged, the lack of publicly available high-quality benchmark datasets is the main bottleneck to hamper the development progress of this task. To advance this field, we construct a new high-quality dataset for Laparoscopic Surgery image Desmoking, named LSD3K, consisting of 3,000 paired synthetic non-homogeneous smoke images. In this paper, we provide a dataset generation pipeline, which includes modeling smoke shape using Blender, collecting ground-truth images from the Cholec80 dataset, random sampling of smoke masks and etc. Based on the proposed benchmark, we further conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the existing representative desmoking algorithms. The proposed dataset is publicly available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v0U5_3S4nJpaUiP898Q0pc-MfEAtnbOq/view?usp=sharing</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based Bi-dimensional Aggregation Network for SAR Image Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image change detection is critical in remote sensing image analysis. Recently, the attention mechanism has been widely used in change detection tasks. However, existing attention mechanisms often employ down-sampling operations such as average pooling on the Key and Value components to enhance computational efficiency. These irreversible operations result in the loss of high-frequency components and other important information. To address this limitation, we develop Wavelet-based Bi-dimensional Aggregation Network (WBANet) for SAR image change detection. We design a wavelet-based self-attention block that includes discrete wavelet transform and inverse discrete wavelet transform operations on Key and Value components. Hence, the feature undergoes downsampling without any loss of information, while simultaneously enhancing local contextual awareness through an expanded receptive field. Additionally, we have incorporated a bi-dimensional aggregation module that boosts the non-linear representation capability by merging spatial and channel information via broadcast mechanism. Experimental results on three SAR datasets demonstrate that our WBANet significantly outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our WBANet achieves 98.33\%, 96.65\%, and 96.62\% of percentage of correct classification (PCC) on the respective datasets, highlighting its superior performance.

      <title>A Master-Follower Teleoperation System for Robotic Catheterization: Design, Characterization, and Tracking Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimally invasive robotic surgery has gained significant attention over the past two decades. Telerobotic systems, combined with robot-mediated minimally invasive techniques, have enabled surgeons and clinicians to mitigate radiation exposure for medical staff and extend medical services to remote and hard-to-reach areas. To enhance these services, teleoperated robotic surgery systems incorporating master and follower devices should offer transparency, enabling surgeons and clinicians to remotely experience a force interaction similar to the one the follower device experiences with patients' bodies. This paper presents the design and development of a three-degree-of-freedom master-follower teleoperated system for robotic catheterization. To resemble manual intervention by clinicians, the follower device features a grip-insert-release mechanism to eliminate catheter buckling and torsion during operation. The bidirectionally navigable ablation catheter is statically characterized for force-interactive medical interventions. The system's performance is evaluated through approaching and open-loop path tracking over typical circular, infinity-like, and spiral paths. Path tracking errors are presented as mean Euclidean error (MEE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The MEE ranges from 0.64 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.53 cm (spiral path). The MAE also ranges from 0.81 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.92 cm (spiral path). The results indicate that while the system's precision and accuracy with an open-loop controller meet the design targets, closed-loop controllers are necessary to address the catheter's hysteresis and dead zone, and system nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Learned HDR Image Compression for Perceptually Optimal Storage and Display</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) capture and display have seen significant growth in popularity driven by the advancements in technology and increasing consumer demand for superior image quality. As a result, HDR image compression is crucial to fully realize the benefits of HDR imaging without suffering from large file sizes and inefficient data handling. Conventionally, this is achieved by introducing a residual/gain map as additional metadata to bridge the gap between HDR and low dynamic range (LDR) images, making the former compatible with LDR image codecs but offering suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In this work, we initiate efforts towards end-to-end optimized HDR image compression for perceptually optimal storage and display. Specifically, we learn to compress an HDR image into two bitstreams: one for generating an LDR image to ensure compatibility with legacy LDR displays, and another as side information to aid HDR image reconstruction from the output LDR image. To measure the perceptual quality of output HDR and LDR images, we use two recently proposed image distortion metrics, both validated against human perceptual data of image quality and with reference to the uncompressed HDR image. Through end-to-end optimization for rate-distortion performance, our method dramatically improves HDR and LDR image quality at all bit rates.</description>

      <title>Methods to Measure the Broncho-Arterial Ratio and Wall Thickness in the Right Lower Lobe for Defining Radiographic Reversibility of Bronchiectasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diagnosis of bronchiectasis requires measuring abnormal bronchial dilation. It is confirmed using a chest CT scan, where the key feature is an increased broncho-arterial ratio (BAR) (&gt;0.8 in children), often with bronchial wall thickening. Image processing methods facilitate quicker interpretation and detailed evaluations by lobes and segments. Challenges like inclined nature, oblique orientation, and partial volume effect make it difficult to obtain accurate measurements in the upper and middle lobes using the same algorithms. Therefore, accurate detection and measurement of airway and artery regions for BAR and wall thickness in each lobe require different image processing/machine learning methods. We propose methods for: 1. Separating the right lower lobe (RLL) region from full-length CT scans using the tracheal bifurcation (Carina) point as a central marker; 2. Locating the inner diameter of airways and outer diameter of arteries for BAR measurement; and 3. Measuring airway wall thickness (WT) by identifying the outer and inner diameters of airway boundaries. Analysis of 13 HRCT scans with varying thicknesses (0.67mm, 1mm, 2mm) shows the tracheal bifurcation frame can be detected accurately, with a deviation of +/- 2 frames in some cases. A Windows app was developed for measuring inner airway diameter, artery diameter, BAR, and wall thickness, allowing users to draw boundaries around visible BA pairs in the RLL region. Measurements of 10 BA pairs revealed accurate results comparable to those of a human reader, with deviations of +/- 0.10-0.15mm. Additional studies and validation are needed to consolidate inter- and intra-rater variability and enhance the methods.</description>

      <title>Improved Esophageal Varices Assessment from Non-Contrast CT Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Esophageal varices (EV), a serious health concern resulting from portal hypertension, are traditionally diagnosed through invasive endoscopic procedures. Despite non-contrast computed tomography (NC-CT) imaging being a less expensive and non-invasive imaging modality, it has yet to gain full acceptance as a primary clinical diagnostic tool for EV evaluation. To overcome existing diagnostic challenges, we present the Multi-Organ-cOhesion-Network (MOON), a novel framework enhancing the analysis of critical organ features in NC-CT scans for effective assessment of EV. Drawing inspiration from the thorough assessment practices of radiologists, MOON establishes a cohesive multiorgan analysis model that unifies the imaging features of the related organs of EV, namely esophagus, liver, and spleen. This integration significantly increases the diagnostic accuracy for EV. We have compiled an extensive NC-CT dataset of 1,255 patients diagnosed with EV, spanning three grades of severity. Each case is corroborated by endoscopic diagnostic results. The efficacy of MOON has been substantiated through a validation process involving multi-fold cross-validation on 1,010 cases and an independent test on 245 cases, exhibiting superior diagnostic performance compared to methods focusing solely on the esophagus (for classifying severe grade: AUC of 0.864 versus 0.803, and for moderate to severe grades: AUC of 0.832 versus 0.793). To our knowledge, MOON is the first work to incorporate a synchronized multi-organ NC-CT analysis for EV assessment, providing a more acceptable and minimally invasive alternative for patients compared to traditional endoscopy.</description>

      <title>URCDM: Ultra-Resolution Image Synthesis in Histopathology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagnosing medical conditions from histopathology data requires a thorough analysis across the various resolutions of Whole Slide Images (WSI). However, existing generative methods fail to consistently represent the hierarchical structure of WSIs due to a focus on high-fidelity patches. To tackle this, we propose Ultra-Resolution Cascaded Diffusion Models (URCDMs) which are capable of synthesising entire histopathology images at high resolutions whilst authentically capturing the details of both the underlying anatomy and pathology at all magnification levels. We evaluate our method on three separate datasets, consisting of brain, breast and kidney tissue, and surpass existing state-of-the-art multi-resolution models. Furthermore, an expert evaluation study was conducted, demonstrating that URCDMs consistently generate outputs across various resolutions that trained evaluators cannot distinguish from real images. All code and additional examples can be found on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Conformal Performance Range Prediction for Segmentation Output Quality Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have introduced methods to estimate segmentation performance without ground truth, relying solely on neural network softmax outputs. These techniques hold potential for intuitive output quality control. However, such performance estimates rely on calibrated softmax outputs, which is often not the case in modern neural networks. Moreover, the estimates do not take into account inherent uncertainty in segmentation tasks. These limitations may render precise performance predictions unattainable, restricting the practical applicability of performance estimation methods. To address these challenges, we develop a novel approach for predicting performance ranges with statistical guarantees of containing the ground truth with a user specified probability. Our method leverages sampling-based segmentation uncertainty estimation to derive heuristic performance ranges, and applies split conformal prediction to transform these estimates into rigorous prediction ranges that meet the desired guarantees. We demonstrate our approach on the FIVES retinal vessel segmentation dataset and compare five commonly used sampling-based uncertainty estimation techniques. Our results show that it is possible to achieve the desired coverage with small prediction ranges, highlighting the potential of performance range prediction as a valuable tool for output quality control.</description>

      <title>DiffuX2CT: Diffusion Learning to Reconstruct CT Images from Biplanar X-Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely utilized in clinical settings because it delivers detailed 3D images of the human body. However, performing CT scans is not always feasible due to radiation exposure and limitations in certain surgical environments. As an alternative, reconstructing CT images from ultra-sparse X-rays offers a valuable solution and has gained significant interest in scientific research and medical applications. However, it presents great challenges as it is inherently an ill-posed problem, often compromised by artifacts resulting from overlapping structures in X-ray images. In this paper, we propose DiffuX2CT, which models CT reconstruction from orthogonal biplanar X-rays as a conditional diffusion process. DiffuX2CT is established with a 3D global coherence denoising model with a new, implicit conditioning mechanism. We realize the conditioning mechanism by a newly designed tri-plane decoupling generator and an implicit neural decoder. By doing so, DiffuX2CT achieves structure-controllable reconstruction, which enables 3D structural information to be recovered from 2D X-rays, therefore producing faithful textures in CT images. As an extra contribution, we collect a real-world lumbar CT dataset, called LumbarV, as a new benchmark to verify the clinical significance and performance of CT reconstruction from X-rays. Extensive experiments on this dataset and three more publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Hyp2Nav: Hyperbolic Planning and Curiosity for Crowd Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly becoming a strong fixture in social environments. Effective crowd navigation requires not only safe yet fast planning, but should also enable interpretability and computational efficiency for working in real-time on embedded devices. In this work, we advocate for hyperbolic learning to enable crowd navigation and we introduce Hyp2Nav. Different from conventional reinforcement learning-based crowd navigation methods, Hyp2Nav leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic geometry to better encode the hierarchical nature of decision-making processes in navigation tasks. We propose a hyperbolic policy model and a hyperbolic curiosity module that results in effective social navigation, best success rates, and returns across multiple simulation settings, using up to 6 times fewer parameters than competitor state-of-the-art models. With our approach, it becomes even possible to obtain policies that work in 2-dimensional embedding spaces, opening up new possibilities for low-resource crowd navigation and model interpretability. Insightfully, the internal hyperbolic representation of Hyp2Nav correlates with how much attention the robot pays to the surrounding crowds, e.g. due to multiple people occluding its pathway or to a few of them showing colliding plans, rather than to its own planned route.</description>

      <title>Aligning Sight and Sound: Advanced Sound Source Localization Through Audio-Visual Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on learning-based sound source localization have mainly focused on the localization performance perspective. However, prior work and existing benchmarks overlook a crucial aspect: cross-modal interaction, which is essential for interactive sound source localization. Cross-modal interaction is vital for understanding semantically matched or mismatched audio-visual events, such as silent objects or off-screen sounds. In this paper, we first comprehensively examine the cross-modal interaction of existing methods, benchmarks, evaluation metrics, and cross-modal understanding tasks. Then, we identify the limitations of previous studies and make several contributions to overcome the limitations. First, we introduce a new synthetic benchmark for interactive sound source localization. Second, we introduce new evaluation metrics to rigorously assess sound source localization methods, focusing on accurately evaluating both localization performance and cross-modal interaction ability. Third, we propose a learning framework with a cross-modal alignment strategy to enhance cross-modal interaction. Lastly, we evaluate both interactive sound source localization and auxiliary cross-modal retrieval tasks together to thoroughly assess cross-modal interaction capabilities and benchmark competing methods. Our new benchmarks and evaluation metrics reveal previously overlooked issues in sound source localization studies. Our proposed novel method, with enhanced cross-modal alignment, shows superior sound source localization performance. This work provides the most comprehensive analysis of sound source localization to date, with extensive validation of competing methods on both existing and new benchmarks using new and standard evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Shaded Route Planning Using Active Segmentation and Identification of Satellite Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heatwaves pose significant health risks, particularly due to prolonged exposure to high summer temperatures. Vulnerable groups, especially pedestrians and cyclists on sun-exposed sidewalks, motivate the development of a route planning method that incorporates somatosensory temperature effects through shade ratio consideration. This paper is the first to introduce a pipeline that utilizes segmentation foundation models to extract shaded areas from high-resolution satellite images. These areas are then integrated into a multi-layered road map, enabling users to customize routes based on a balance between distance and shade exposure, thereby enhancing comfort and health during outdoor activities. Specifically, we construct a graph-based representation of the road map, where links indicate connectivity and are updated with shade ratio data for dynamic route planning. This system is already implemented online, with a video demonstration, and will be specifically adapted to assist travelers during the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.</description>

      <title>GAP9Shield: A 150GOPS AI-capable Ultra-low Power Module for Vision and Ranging Applications on Nano-drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of AI and digital signal processing technologies, combined with affordable energy-efficient processors, has propelled the development of both hardware and software for drone applications. Nano-drones, which fit into the palm of the hand, are suitable for indoor environments and safe for human interaction; however, they often fail to deliver the required performance for complex tasks due to the lack of hardware providing sufficient sensing and computing performance. Addressing this gap, we present the GAP9Shield, a nano-drone-compatible module powered by the GAP9, a 150GOPS-capable SoC. The system also includes a 5MP OV5647 camera for high-definition imaging, a WiFi-BLE NINA module, and a 5D VL53L1-based ranging subsystem, which enhances obstacle avoidance capabilities. In comparison with similarly targeted state-of-the-art systems, GAP9Shield provides a 20% higher sample rate (RGB images) while offering a 20% weight reduction. In this paper, we also highlight the energy efficiency and processing power capabilities of GAP9 for object detection (YOLO), localization, and mapping, which can run within a power envelope of below 100 mW and at low latency (as 17 ms for object detection), highlighting the transformative potential of GAP9 for the new generation of nano-drone applications.</description>

Abstract: A novel evaluation study of the most appropriate round function for nearest-neighbor (NN) image interpolation is presented. Evaluated rounding functions are selected among the five rounding rules defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 754-2008 standard. Both full- and no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are used to study and evaluate the influence of rounding functions on NN interpolation image quality. The concept of achieved occurrences over targeted occurrences is used to determine the percentage of achieved occurrences based on the number of test images used. Inferential statistical analysis is applied to deduce from a small number of images and draw a conclusion of the behavior of each rounding function on a bigger number of images. Under the normal distribution and at the level of confidence equals to 95%, the maximum and minimum achievable occurrences by each evaluated rounding function are both provided based on the inferential analysis-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances of Continual Learning in Computer Vision: An Overview</title>

Abstract: In contrast to batch learning where all training data is available at once, continual learning represents a family of methods that accumulate knowledge and learn continuously with data available in sequential order. Similar to the human learning process with the ability of learning, fusing, and accumulating new knowledge coming at different time steps, continual learning is considered to have high practical significance. Hence, continual learning has been studied in various artificial intelligence tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the recent progress of continual learning in computer vision. In particular, the works are grouped by their representative techniques, including regularization, knowledge distillation, memory, generative replay, parameter isolation, and a combination of the above techniques. For each category of these techniques, both its characteristics and applications in computer vision are presented. At the end of this overview, several subareas, where continuous knowledge accumulation is potentially helpful while continual learning has not been well studied, are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the Viability of Monocular Depth Pre-training for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13987v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of whether pre-training on geometric tasks is viable for downstream transfer to semantic tasks is important for two reasons, one practical and the other scientific. If the answer is positive, we may be able to reduce pre-training cost and bias from human annotators significantly. If the answer is negative, it may shed light on the role of embodiment in the emergence of language and other cognitive functions in evolutionary history. To frame the question in a way that is testable with current means, we pre-train a model on a geometric task, and test whether that can be used to prime a notion of 'object' that enables inference of semantics as soon as symbols (labels) are assigned. We choose monocular depth prediction as the geometric task, and semantic segmentation as the downstream semantic task, and design a collection of empirical tests by exploring different forms of supervision, training pipelines, and data sources for both depth pre-training and semantic fine-tuning. We find that monocular depth is a viable form of pre-training for semantic segmentation, validated by improvements over common baselines. Based on the findings, we propose several possible mechanisms behind the improvements, including their relation to dataset size, resolution, architecture, in/out-of-domain source data, and validate them through a wide range of ablation studies. We also find that optical flow, which at first glance may seem as good as depth prediction since it optimizes the same photometric reprojection error, is considerably less effective, as it does not explicitly aim to infer the latent structure of the scene, but rather the raw phenomenology of temporally adjacent images.</description>

      <title>A Coarse-to-Fine Place Recognition Approach using Attention-guided Descriptors and Overlap Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Place recognition is a challenging but crucial task in robotics. Current description-based methods may be limited by representation capabilities, while pairwise similarity-based methods require exhaustive searches, which is time-consuming. In this paper, we present a novel coarse-to-fine approach to address these problems, which combines BEV (Bird's Eye View) feature extraction, coarse-grained matching and fine-grained verification. In the coarse stage, our approach utilizes an attention-guided network to generate attention-guided descriptors. We then employ a fast affinity-based candidate selection process to identify the Top-K most similar candidates. In the fine stage, we estimate pairwise overlap among the narrowed-down place candidates to determine the final match. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released publicly soon.</description>

      <title>Adjusting Logit in Gaussian Form for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is not uncommon that real-world data are distributed with a long tail. For such data, the learning of deep neural networks becomes challenging because it is hard to classify tail classes correctly. In the literature, several existing methods have addressed this problem by reducing classifier bias, provided that the features obtained with long-tailed data are representative enough. However, we find that training directly on long-tailed data leads to uneven embedding space. That is, the embedding space of head classes severely compresses that of tail classes, which is not conducive to subsequent classifier learning. This paper therefore studies the problem of long-tailed visual recognition from the perspective of feature level. We introduce feature augmentation to balance the embedding distribution. The features of different classes are perturbed with varying amplitudes in Gaussian form. Based on these perturbed features, two novel logit adjustment methods are proposed to improve model performance at a modest computational overhead. Subsequently, the distorted embedding spaces of all classes can be calibrated. In such balanced-distributed embedding spaces, the biased classifier can be eliminated by simply retraining the classifier with class-balanced sampling data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art ones.

      <title>NCL++: Nested Collaborative Learning for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-tailed visual recognition has received increasing attention in recent years. Due to the extremely imbalanced data distribution in long-tailed learning, the learning process shows great uncertainties. For example, the predictions of different experts on the same image vary remarkably despite the same training settings. To alleviate the uncertainty, we propose a Nested Collaborative Learning (NCL++) which tackles the long-tailed learning problem by a collaborative learning. To be specific, the collaborative learning consists of two folds, namely inter-expert collaborative learning (InterCL) and intra-expert collaborative learning (IntraCL). In-terCL learns multiple experts collaboratively and concurrently, aiming to transfer the knowledge among different experts. IntraCL is similar to InterCL, but it aims to conduct the collaborative learning on multiple augmented copies of the same image within the single expert. To achieve the collaborative learning in long-tailed learning, the balanced online distillation is proposed to force the consistent predictions among different experts and augmented copies, which reduces the learning uncertainties. Moreover, in order to improve the meticulous distinguishing ability on the confusing categories, we further propose a Hard Category Mining (HCM), which selects the negative categories with high predicted scores as the hard categories. Then, the collaborative learning is formulated in a nested way, in which the learning is conducted on not just all categories from a full perspective but some hard categories from a partial perspective. Extensive experiments manifest the superiority of our method with outperforming the state-of-the-art whether with using a single model or an ensemble. The code will be publicly released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Talking face generation aims to create realistic videos with accurate lip synchronization and high visual quality, using given audio and reference video while preserving identity and visual characteristics. In this paper, we start by identifying several issues with existing synchronization learning methods. These involve unstable training, lip synchronization, and visual quality issues caused by lip-sync loss, SyncNet, and lip leaking from the identity reference. To address these issues, we first tackle the lip leaking problem by introducing a silent-lip generator, which changes the lips of the identity reference to alleviate leakage. We then introduce stabilized synchronization loss and AVSyncNet to overcome problems caused by lip-sync loss and SyncNet. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and lip synchronization. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate our individual contributions and their cohesive effects.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Distribution Mismatch in Quantizing Image Super-Resolution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although quantization has emerged as a promising approach to reducing computational complexity across various high-level vision tasks, it inevitably leads to accuracy loss in image super-resolution (SR) networks. This is due to the significantly divergent feature distributions across different channels and input images of the SR networks, which complicates the selection of a fixed quantization range. Existing works address this distribution mismatch problem by dynamically adapting quantization ranges to the varying distributions during test time. However, such a dynamic adaptation incurs additional computational costs during inference. In contrast, we propose a new quantization-aware training scheme that effectively Overcomes the Distribution Mismatch problem in SR networks without the need for dynamic adaptation. Intuitively, this mismatch can be mitigated by regularizing the distance between the feature and a fixed quantization range. However, we observe that such regularization can conflict with the reconstruction loss during training, negatively impacting SR accuracy. Therefore, we opt to regularize the mismatch only when the gradients of the regularization are aligned with those of the reconstruction loss. Additionally, we introduce a layer-wise weight clipping correction scheme to determine a more suitable quantization range for layer-wise weights. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the distribution mismatch and achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Feature Learning Using Co-Tuplet Loss for Offline Handwritten Signature Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Handwritten signature verification, crucial for legal and financial institutions, faces challenges including inter-writer similarity, intra-writer variations, and limited signature samples. To address these, we introduce a MultiScale Signature feature learning Network (MS-SigNet) with a novel metric learning loss called the co-tuplet loss, designed for offline handwritten signature verification. MS-SigNet learns both global and regional signature features from multiple spatial scales, enhancing feature discrimination. This approach effectively distinguishes genuine signatures from skilled forgeries by capturing overall strokes and detailed local differences. The co-tuplet loss, focusing on multiple positive and negative examples, overcomes the limitations of typical metric learning losses by addressing inter-writer similarity and intra-writer variations and emphasizing informative examples. We also present HanSig, a large-scale Chinese signature dataset (available at https://github.com/hsinmin/HanSig) to support robust system development. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets in different languages demonstrate the promising performance of our method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>SkipcrossNets: Adaptive Skip-cross Fusion for Road Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is increasingly being used for autonomous driving tasks, as different modalities provide unique information for feature extraction. However, the existing two-stream networks are only fused at a specific network layer, which requires a lot of manual attempts to set up. As the CNN goes deeper, the two modal features become more and more advanced and abstract, and the fusion occurs at the feature level with a large gap, which can easily hurt the performance. To reduce the loss of height and depth information during the process of projecting point clouds into 2D space, we utilize calibration parameters to project the point cloud into Altitude Difference Images (ADIs), which exhibit more distinct road features. In this study, we propose a novel fusion architecture called Skip-cross Networks (SkipcrossNets), which combine adaptively ADIs and camera images without being bound to a certain fusion epoch. Specifically, skip-cross fusion strategy connects each layer to each layer in a feed-forward manner, and for each layer, the feature maps of all previous layers are used as input and its own feature maps are used as input to all subsequent layers for the other modality, enhancing feature propagation and multi-modal features fusion. This strategy facilitates selection of the most similar feature layers from two modalities, enhancing feature reuse and providing complementary effects for sparse point cloud features. The advantages of skip-cross fusion strategy is demonstrated through application to the KITTI and A2D2 datasets, achieving a MaxF score of 96.85% on KITTI and an F1 score of 84.84% on A2D2. The model parameters require only 2.33 MB of memory at a speed of 68.24 FPS, which can be viable for mobile terminals and embedded devices.</description>

      <title>Realistic Unsupervised CLIP Fine-tuning with Universal Entropy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of vision-language models, such as CLIP, has spurred a significant research effort towards their application for downstream supervised learning tasks. Although some previous studies have explored the unsupervised fine-tuning of CLIP, they often rely on prior knowledge in the form of class names associated with ground truth labels. This paper explores a realistic unsupervised fine-tuning scenario, considering the presence of out-of-distribution samples from unknown classes within the unlabeled data. In particular, we focus on simultaneously enhancing out-of-distribution detection and the recognition of instances associated with known classes. To tackle this problem, we present a simple, efficient, and effective approach called Universal Entropy Optimization (UEO). UEO leverages sample-level confidence to approximately minimize the conditional entropy of confident instances and maximize the marginal entropy of less confident instances. Apart from optimizing the textual prompt, UEO incorporates optimization of channel-wise affine transformations within the visual branch of CLIP. Extensive experiments across 15 domains and 4 different types of prior knowledge validate the effectiveness of UEO compared to baseline methods. The code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/tim-learn/UEO}.</description>

      <title>Bridging Sensor Gaps via Attention Gated Tuning for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-hungry HSI classification methods require high-quality labeled HSIs, which are often costly to obtain. This characteristic limits the performance potential of data-driven methods when dealing with limited annotated samples. Bridging the domain gap between data acquired from different sensors allows us to utilize abundant labeled data across sensors to break this bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-Gated Tuning (AGT) strategy and a triplet-structured transformer model, Tri-Former, to address this issue. The AGT strategy serves as a bridge, allowing us to leverage existing labeled HSI datasets, even RGB datasets to enhance the performance on new HSI datasets with limited samples. Instead of inserting additional parameters inside the basic model, we train a lightweight auxiliary branch that takes intermediate features as input from the basic model and makes predictions. The proposed AGT resolves conflicts between heterogeneous and even cross-modal data by suppressing the disturbing information and enhances the useful information through a soft gate. Additionally, we introduce Tri-Former, a triplet-structured transformer with a spectral-spatial separation design that enhances parameter utilization and computational efficiency, enabling easier and flexible fine-tuning. Comparison experiments conducted on three representative HSI datasets captured by different sensors demonstrate the proposed Tri-Former achieves better performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Homologous, heterologous and cross-modal tuning experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed AGT.

Abstract: Generating creative combinatorial objects from two seemingly unrelated object texts is a challenging task in text-to-image synthesis, often hindered by a focus on emulating existing data distributions. In this paper, we develop a straightforward yet highly effective method, called \textbf{balance swap-sampling}. First, we propose a swapping mechanism that generates a novel combinatorial object image set by randomly exchanging intrinsic elements of two text embeddings through a cutting-edge diffusion model. Second, we introduce a balance swapping region to efficiently sample a small subset from the newly generated image set by balancing CLIP distances between the new images and their original generations, increasing the likelihood of accepting the high-quality combinations. Last, we employ a segmentation method to compare CLIP distances among the segmented components, ultimately selecting the most promising object from the sampled subset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent SOTA T2I methods. Surprisingly, our results even rival those of human artists, such as frog-broccoli.</description>

      <title>Energy-Calibrated VAE with Test Time Free Lunch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04071v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel generative model that utilizes a conditional Energy-Based Model (EBM) for enhancing Variational Autoencoder (VAE), termed Energy-Calibrated VAE (EC-VAE). Specifically, VAEs often suffer from blurry generated samples due to the lack of a tailored training on the samples generated in the generative direction. On the other hand, EBMs can generate high-quality samples but require expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. To address these issues, we introduce a conditional EBM for calibrating the generative direction of VAE during training, without requiring it for the generation at test time. In particular, we train EC-VAE upon both the input data and the calibrated samples with adaptive weight to enhance efficacy while avoiding MCMC sampling at test time. Furthermore, we extend the calibration idea of EC-VAE to variational learning and normalizing flows, and apply EC-VAE to an additional application of zero-shot image restoration via neural transport prior and range-null theory. We evaluate the proposed method with two applications, including image generation and zero-shot image restoration, and the experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance over single-step non-adversarial generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/DJ-LYH/EC-VAE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable results in generating 2D images and small-scale 3D objects. However, their application to the synthesis of large-scale 3D scenes has been rarely explored. This is mainly due to the inherent complexity and bulky size of 3D scenery data, particularly outdoor scenes, and the limited availability of comprehensive real-world datasets, which makes training a stable scene diffusion model challenging. In this work, we explore how to effectively generate large-scale 3D scenes using the coarse-to-fine paradigm. We introduce a framework, the Pyramid Discrete Diffusion model (PDD), which employs scale-varied diffusion models to progressively generate high-quality outdoor scenes. Experimental results of PDD demonstrate our successful exploration in generating 3D scenes both unconditionally and conditionally. We further showcase the data compatibility of the PDD model, due to its multi-scale architecture: a PDD model trained on one dataset can be easily fine-tuned with another dataset.

      <description>arXiv:2311.17717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models aims to disable pre-trained diffusion models from generating images related to a target concept. To perform reliable concept erasure, the properties of robustness and locality are desirable. The former refrains the model from producing images associated with the target concept for any paraphrased or learned prompts, while the latter preserves its ability in generating images with non-target concepts. In this paper, we propose Reliable Concept Erasing via Lightweight Erasers (Receler). It learns a lightweight Eraser to perform concept erasing while satisfying the above desirable properties through the proposed concept-localized regularization and adversarial prompt learning scheme. Experiments with various concepts verify the superiority of Receler over previous methods.</description>

      <title>PALM: Predicting Actions through Language Models</title>

Abstract: Understanding human activity is a crucial yet intricate task in egocentric vision, a field that focuses on capturing visual perspectives from the camera wearer's viewpoint. Traditional methods heavily rely on representation learning that is trained on a large amount of video data. However, a major challenge arises from the difficulty of obtaining effective video representation. This difficulty stems from the complex and variable nature of human activities, which contrasts with the limited availability of data. In this study, we introduce PALM, an approach that tackles the task of long-term action anticipation, which aims to forecast forthcoming sequences of actions over an extended period. Our method PALM incorporates an action recognition model to track previous action sequences and a vision-language model to articulate relevant environmental details. By leveraging the context provided by these past events, we devise a prompting strategy for action anticipation using large language models (LLMs). Moreover, we implement maximal marginal relevance for example selection to facilitate in-context learning of the LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that PALM surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in the task of long-term action anticipation on the Ego4D benchmark. We further validate PALM on two additional benchmarks, affirming its capacity for generalization across intricate activities with different sets of taxonomies.</description>

      <title>BAM-DETR: Boundary-Aligned Moment Detection Transformer for Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to localize moments relevant to a language description. Recently, DETR-like approaches achieved notable progress by predicting the center and length of a target moment. However, they suffer from the issue of center misalignment raised by the inherent ambiguity of moment centers, leading to inaccurate predictions. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel boundary-oriented moment formulation. In our paradigm, the model no longer needs to find the precise center but instead suffices to predict any anchor point within the interval, from which the boundaries are directly estimated. Based on this idea, we design a boundary-aligned moment detection transformer, equipped with a dual-pathway decoding process. Specifically, it refines the anchor and boundaries within parallel pathways using global and boundary-focused attention, respectively. This separate design allows the model to focus on desirable regions, enabling precise refinement of moment predictions. Further, we propose a quality-based ranking method, ensuring that proposals with high localization qualities are prioritized over incomplete ones. Experiments on three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Pilhyeon/BAM-DETR.</description>

      <title>Sparse Beats Dense: Rethinking Supervision in Radar-Camera Depth Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely believed that sparse supervision is worse than dense supervision in the field of depth completion, but the underlying reasons for this are rarely discussed. To this end, we revisit the task of radar-camera depth completion and present a new method with sparse LiDAR supervision to outperform previous dense LiDAR supervision methods in both accuracy and speed. Specifically, when trained by sparse LiDAR supervision, depth completion models usually output depth maps containing significant stripe-like artifacts. We find that such a phenomenon is caused by the implicitly learned positional distribution pattern from sparse LiDAR supervision, termed as LiDAR Distribution Leakage (LDL) in this paper. Based on such understanding, we present a novel Disruption-Compensation radar-camera depth completion framework to address this issue. The Disruption part aims to deliberately disrupt the learning of LiDAR distribution from sparse supervision, while the Compensation part aims to leverage 3D spatial and 2D semantic information to compensate for the information loss of previous disruptions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that by reducing the impact of LDL, our framework with sparse supervision outperforms the state-of-the-art dense supervision methods with 11.6% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE)} and 1.6x speedup in Frame Per Second (FPS)}.

      <title>Deep Generative Attacks and Countermeasures for Data-Driven Offline Signature Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerabilities of data-driven offline signature verification (DASV) systems to generative attacks and proposes robust countermeasures. Specifically, we explore the efficacy of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) in creating deceptive signatures that challenge DASV systems. Using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to evaluate the quality of forged signatures, we assess their impact on DASV systems built with Xception, ResNet152V2, and DenseNet201 architectures. Initial results showed False Accept Rates (FARs) ranging from 0% to 5.47% across all models and datasets. However, exposure to synthetic signatures significantly increased FARs, with rates ranging from 19.12% to 61.64%. The proposed countermeasure, i.e., retraining the models with real + synthetic datasets, was very effective, reducing FARs between 0% and 0.99%. These findings emphasize the necessity of investigating vulnerabilities in security systems like DASV and reinforce the role of generative methods in enhancing the security of data-driven systems.</description>

      <title>PixelLM: Pixel Reasoning with Large Multimodal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress, generating pixel-level masks for image reasoning tasks involving multiple open-world targets remains a challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce PixelLM, an effective and efficient LMM for pixel-level reasoning and understanding. Central to PixelLM is a novel, lightweight pixel decoder and a comprehensive segmentation codebook. The decoder efficiently produces masks from the hidden embeddings of the codebook tokens, which encode detailed target-relevant information. With this design, PixelLM harmonizes with the structure of popular LMMs and avoids the need for additional costly segmentation models. Furthermore, we propose a target refinement loss to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between multiple targets, leading to substantially improved mask quality. To advance research in this area, we construct MUSE, a high-quality multi-target reasoning segmentation benchmark. PixelLM excels across various pixel-level image reasoning and understanding tasks, outperforming well-established methods in multiple benchmarks, including MUSE, single- and multi-referring segmentation. Comprehensive ablations confirm the efficacy of each proposed component. All code, models, and datasets will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>MinD-3D: Reconstruct High-quality 3D objects in Human Brain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Recon3DMind, an innovative task aimed at reconstructing 3D visuals from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals, marking a significant advancement in the fields of cognitive neuroscience and computer vision. To support this pioneering task, we present the fMRI-Shape dataset, which includes data from 14 participants and features 360-degree videos of 3D objects to enable comprehensive fMRI signal capture across various settings, thereby laying a foundation for future research. Furthermore, we propose MinD-3D, a novel and effective three-stage framework specifically designed to decode the brain's 3D visual information from fMRI signals, demonstrating the feasibility of this challenging task. The framework begins by extracting and aggregating features from fMRI frames through a neuro-fusion encoder, subsequently employs a feature bridge diffusion model to generate visual features, and ultimately recovers the 3D object via a generative transformer decoder. We assess the performance of MinD-3D using a suite of semantic and structural metrics and analyze the correlation between the features extracted by our model and the visual regions of interest (ROIs) in fMRI signals. Our findings indicate that MinD-3D not only reconstructs 3D objects with high semantic relevance and spatial similarity but also significantly enhances our understanding of the human brain's capabilities in processing 3D visual information.

      <title>SWinGS: Sliding Windows for Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis has shown rapid progress recently, with methods capable of producing increasingly photorealistic results. 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising method, producing high-quality renderings of scenes and enabling interactive viewing at real-time frame rates. However, it is limited to static scenes. In this work, we extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes. We model a scene's dynamics using dynamic MLPs, learning deformations from temporally-local canonical representations to per-frame 3D Gaussians. To disentangle static and dynamic regions, tuneable parameters weigh each Gaussian's respective MLP parameters, improving the dynamics modelling of imbalanced scenes. We introduce a sliding window training strategy that partitions the sequence into smaller manageable windows to handle arbitrary length scenes while maintaining high rendering quality. We propose an adaptive sampling strategy to determine appropriate window size hyperparameters based on the scene's motion, balancing training overhead with visual quality. Training a separate dynamic 3D Gaussian model for each sliding window allows the canonical representation to change, enabling the reconstruction of scenes with significant geometric changes. Temporal consistency is enforced using a fine-tuning step with self-supervising consistency loss on randomly sampled novel views. As a result, our method produces high-quality renderings of general dynamic scenes with competitive quantitative performance, which can be viewed in real-time in our dynamic interactive viewer.</description>

      <title>Fully Sparse 3D Occupancy Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving. Previous methods typically construct dense 3D volumes, neglecting the inherent sparsity of the scene and suffering from high computational costs. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel fully sparse occupancy network, termed SparseOcc. SparseOcc initially reconstructs a sparse 3D representation from camera-only inputs and subsequently predicts semantic/instance occupancy from the 3D sparse representation by sparse queries. A mask-guided sparse sampling is designed to enable sparse queries to interact with 2D features in a fully sparse manner, thereby circumventing costly dense features or global attention. Additionally, we design a thoughtful ray-based evaluation metric, namely RayIoU, to solve the inconsistency penalty along the depth axis raised in traditional voxel-level mIoU criteria. SparseOcc demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving a RayIoU of 34.0, while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 17.3 FPS, with 7 history frames inputs. By incorporating more preceding frames to 15, SparseOcc continuously improves its performance to 35.1 RayIoU without bells and whistles.</description>

      <title>ScatterFormer: Efficient Voxel Transformer with Scattered Linear Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Window-based transformers excel in large-scale point cloud understanding by capturing context-aware representations with affordable attention computation in a more localized manner. However, the sparse nature of point clouds leads to a significant variance in the number of voxels per window. Existing methods group the voxels in each window into fixed-length sequences through extensive sorting and padding operations, resulting in a non-negligible computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce ScatterFormer, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first to directly apply attention to voxels across different windows as a single sequence. The key of ScatterFormer is a Scattered Linear Attention (SLA) module, which leverages the pre-computation of key-value pairs in linear attention to enable parallel computation on the variable-length voxel sequences divided by windows. Leveraging the hierarchical structure of GPUs and shared memory, we propose a chunk-wise algorithm that reduces the SLA module's latency to less than 1 millisecond on moderate GPUs. Furthermore, we develop a cross-window interaction module that improves the locality and connectivity of voxel features across different windows, eliminating the need for extensive window shifting. Our proposed ScatterFormer demonstrates 73.8 mAP (L2) on the Waymo Open Dataset and 72.4 NDS on the NuScenes dataset, running at an outstanding detection rate of 23 FPS.The code is available at \href{https://github.com/skyhehe123/ScatterFormer}{https://github.com/skyhehe123/ScatterFormer}.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal vision-language model for generalizable annotation-free pathology localization and clinical diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defining pathologies automatically from medical images aids the understanding of the emergence and progression of diseases, and such an ability is crucial in clinical diagnostics. However, existing deep learning models heavily rely on expert annotations and lack generalization capabilities in open clinical environments. In this study, we present a generalizable vision-language model for Annotation-Free pathology Localization (AFLoc). The core strength of AFLoc lies in its extensive multi-level semantic structure-based contrastive learning, which comprehensively aligns multi-granularity medical concepts from reports with abundant image features, to adapt to the diverse expressions of pathologies and unseen pathologies without the reliance on image annotations from experts. We demonstrate the proof of concept on Chest X-ray images, with extensive experimental validation across 6 distinct external datasets, encompassing 13 types of chest pathologies. The results demonstrate that AFLoc surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pathology localization and classification, and even outperforms the human benchmark in locating 5 different pathologies. Additionally, we further verify its generalization ability by applying it to retinal fundus images. Our approach showcases AFLoc's versatilities and underscores its suitability for clinical diagnosis in complex clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Quantized Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: The emergence of billion-parameter diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL, Imagen, and DALL-E 3 has significantly propelled the domain of generative AI. However, their large-scale architecture presents challenges in fine-tuning and deployment due to high resource demands and slow inference speed. This paper explores the relatively unexplored yet promising realm of fine-tuning quantized diffusion models. Our analysis revealed that the baseline neglects the distinct patterns in model weights and the different roles throughout time steps when finetuning the diffusion model. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel memory-efficient fine-tuning method specifically designed for quantized diffusion models, dubbed TuneQDM. Our approach introduces quantization scales as separable functions to consider inter-channel weight patterns. Then, it optimizes these scales in a timestep-specific manner for effective reflection of the role of each time step. TuneQDM achieves performance on par with its full-precision counterpart while simultaneously offering significant memory efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the baseline in both single-/multi-subject generations, exhibiting high subject fidelity and prompt fidelity comparable to the full precision model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the neural radiance field (NeRF) model has gained popularity due to its ability to recover complex 3D scenes. Following its success, many approaches proposed different NeRF representations in order to further improve both runtime and performance. One such example is Triplane, in which NeRF is represented using three 2D feature planes. This enables easily using existing 2D neural networks in this framework, e.g., to generate the three planes. Despite its advantage, the triplane representation lagged behind in its 3D recovery quality compared to NeRF solutions. In this work, we propose TriNeRFLet, a 2D wavelet-based multiscale triplane representation for NeRF, which closes the 3D recovery performance gap and is competitive with current state-of-the-art methods. Building upon the triplane framework, we also propose a novel super-resolution (SR) technique that combines a diffusion model with TriNeRFLet for improving NeRF resolution.</description>

Abstract: The increasing demand for intelligent systems capable of interpreting and reasoning about visual content requires the development of large Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) that are not only accurate but also have explicit reasoning capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to develop a VLM with the ability to conduct explicit reasoning based on visual content and textual instructions. We introduce a system that can ask a question to acquire necessary knowledge, thereby enhancing the robustness and explicability of the reasoning process. To this end, we developed a novel dataset generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), designed to promote chain-of-thought reasoning combined with a question-asking mechanism. The dataset covers a range of tasks, from common ones like caption generation to specialized VQA tasks that require expert knowledge. Furthermore, using the dataset we created, we fine-tuned an existing VLM. This training enabled the models to generate questions and perform iterative reasoning during inference. The results demonstrated a stride toward a more robust, accurate, and interpretable VLM, capable of reasoning explicitly and seeking information proactively when confronted with ambiguous visual input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of generative diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of style transfer. However, most current style transfer methods based on diffusion models typically involve a slow iterative optimization process, e.g., model fine-tuning and textual inversion of style concept. In this paper, we introduce FreeStyle, an innovative style transfer method built upon a pre-trained large diffusion model, requiring no further optimization. Besides, our method enables style transfer only through a text description of the desired style, eliminating the necessity of style images. Specifically, we propose a dual-stream encoder and single-stream decoder architecture, replacing the conventional U-Net in diffusion models. In the dual-stream encoder, two distinct branches take the content image and style text prompt as inputs, achieving content and style decoupling. In the decoder, we further modulate features from the dual streams based on a given content image and the corresponding style text prompt for precise style transfer. Our experimental results demonstrate high-quality synthesis and fidelity of our method across various content images and style text prompts. Compared with state-of-the-art methods that require training, our FreeStyle approach notably reduces the computational burden by thousands of iterations, while achieving comparable or superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics including CLIP Aesthetic Score, CLIP Score, and Preference. We have released the code anonymously at: \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FreeStyleAnonymous-0F9B}</description>

      <title>Common Sense Reasoning for Deepfake Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art deepfake detection approaches rely on image-based features extracted via neural networks. While these approaches trained in a supervised manner extract likely fake features, they may fall short in representing unnatural `non-physical' semantic facial attributes -- blurry hairlines, double eyebrows, rigid eye pupils, or unnatural skin shading. However, such facial attributes are easily perceived by humans and used to discern the authenticity of an image based on human common sense. Furthermore, image-based feature extraction methods that provide visual explanations via saliency maps can be hard to interpret for humans. To address these challenges, we frame deepfake detection as a Deepfake Detection VQA (DD-VQA) task and model human intuition by providing textual explanations that describe common sense reasons for labeling an image as real or fake. We introduce a new annotated dataset and propose a Vision and Language Transformer-based framework for the DD-VQA task. We also incorporate text and image-aware feature alignment formulation to enhance multi-modal representation learning. As a result, we improve upon existing deepfake detection models by integrating our learned vision representations, which reason over common sense knowledge from the DD-VQA task. We provide extensive empirical results demonstrating that our method enhances detection performance, generalization ability, and language-based interpretability in the deepfake detection task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SynthCLIP, a CLIP model trained on entirely synthetic text-image pairs. Leveraging recent text-to-image (TTI) networks and large language models (LLM), we generate synthetic datasets of images and corresponding captions at scale, with no human intervention. In this work, we provide an analysis on CLIP models trained on synthetic data. We provide insights on the data generation strategy, number of samples required, scaling trends, and resulting properties. We also introduce SynthCI-30M, a purely synthetic dataset comprising 30 million captioned images. Our code, trained models, and data, are released as open source at https://github.com/hammoudhasan/SynthCLIP</description>

      <title>Real-time 3D-aware Portrait Editing from a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents 3DPE, a practical method that can efficiently edit a face image following given prompts, like reference images or text descriptions, in a 3D-aware manner. To this end, a lightweight module is distilled from a 3D portrait generator and a text-to-image model, which provide prior knowledge of face geometry and superior editing capability, respectively. Such a design brings two compelling advantages over existing approaches. First, our method achieves real-time editing with a feedforward network (i.e., ~0.04s per image), over 100x faster than the second competitor. Second, thanks to the powerful priors, our module could focus on the learning of editing-related variations, such that it manages to handle various types of editing simultaneously in the training phase and further supports fast adaptation to user-specified customized types of editing during inference (e.g., with ~5min fine-tuning per style).</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning with Generative Adversarial Networks for Electron Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the potential of self-supervised learning with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for electron microscopy datasets. We show how self-supervised pretraining facilitates efficient fine-tuning for a spectrum of downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, denoising, noise \&amp; background removal, and super-resolution. Experimentation with varying model complexities and receptive field sizes reveals the remarkable phenomenon that fine-tuned models of lower complexity consistently outperform more complex models with random weight initialization. We demonstrate the versatility of self-supervised pretraining across various downstream tasks in the context of electron microscopy, allowing faster convergence and better performance. We conclude that self-supervised pretraining serves as a powerful catalyst, being especially advantageous when limited annotated data are available and efficient scaling of computational cost is important.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current scene flow methods broadly fail to describe motion on small objects, and current scene flow evaluation protocols hide this failure by averaging over many points, with most drawn larger objects. To fix this evaluation failure, we propose a new evaluation protocol, Bucket Normalized EPE, which is class-aware and speed-normalized, enabling contextualized error comparisons between object types that move at vastly different speeds. To highlight current method failures, we propose a frustratingly simple supervised scene flow baseline, TrackFlow, built by bolting a high-quality pretrained detector (trained using many class rebalancing techniques) onto a simple tracker, that produces state-of-the-art performance on current standard evaluations and large improvements over prior art on our new evaluation. Our results make it clear that all scene flow evaluations must be class and speed aware, and supervised scene flow methods must address point class imbalances. We release the evaluation code publicly at https://github.com/kylevedder/BucketedSceneFlowEval.</description>

      <title>Self-Adapting Large Visual-Language Models to Edge Devices across Visual Modalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language (VL) models have sparked interest in their deployment on edge devices, yet challenges in handling diverse visual modalities, manual annotation, and computational constraints remain. We introduce EdgeVL, a novel framework that bridges this gap by seamlessly integrating dual-modality knowledge distillation and quantization-aware contrastive learning. This approach enables the adaptation of large VL models, like CLIP, for efficient use with both RGB and non-RGB images on resource-limited devices without the need for manual annotations. EdgeVL not only transfers visual language alignment capabilities to compact models but also maintains feature quality post-quantization, significantly enhancing open-vocabulary classification performance across various visual modalities. Our work represents the first systematic effort to adapt large VL models for edge deployment, showcasing up to 15.4% accuracy improvements on multiple datasets and up to 93-fold reduction in model size.</description>

Abstract: This work addresses the task of modeling spatiotemporal traffic patterns directly from overhead imagery, which we refer to as image-driven traffic modeling. We extend this line of work and introduce a multi-modal, multi-task transformer-based segmentation architecture that can be used to create dense city-scale traffic models. Our approach includes a geo-temporal positional encoding module for integrating geo-temporal context and a probabilistic objective function for estimating traffic speeds that naturally models temporal variations. We evaluate our method extensively using the Dynamic Traffic Speeds (DTS) benchmark dataset and significantly improve the state-of-the-art. Finally, we introduce the DTS++ dataset to support mobility-related location adaptation experiments.</description>

Abstract: Current visual generation methods can produce high quality videos guided by texts. However, effectively controlling object dynamics remains a challenge. This work explores audio as a cue to generate temporally synchronized image animations. We introduce Audio Synchronized Visual Animation (ASVA), a task animating a static image to demonstrate motion dynamics, temporally guided by audio clips across multiple classes. To this end, we present AVSync15, a dataset curated from VGGSound with videos featuring synchronized audio visual events across 15 categories. We also present a diffusion model, AVSyncD, capable of generating dynamic animations guided by audios. Extensive evaluations validate AVSync15 as a reliable benchmark for synchronized generation and demonstrate our models superior performance. We further explore AVSyncDs potential in a variety of audio synchronized generation tasks, from generating full videos without a base image to controlling object motions with various sounds. We hope our established benchmark can open new avenues for controllable visual generation. More videos on project webpage https://lzhangbj.github.io/projects/asva/asva.html.</description>

      <title>Cracking the neural code for word recognition in convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning to read places a strong challenge on the visual system. Years of expertise lead to a remarkable capacity to separate highly similar letters and encode their relative positions, thus distinguishing words such as FORM and FROM, invariantly over a large range of sizes and absolute positions. How neural circuits achieve invariant word recognition remains unknown. Here, we address this issue by training deep neural network models to recognize written words and then analyzing how reading-specialized units emerge and operate across different layers of the network. With literacy, a small subset of units becomes specialized for word recognition in the learned script, similar to the "visual word form area" of the human brain. We show that these units are sensitive to specific letter identities and their distance from the blank space at the left or right of a word, thus acting as "space bigrams". These units specifically encode ordinal positions and operate by pooling across low and high-frequency detector units from early layers of the network. The proposed neural code provides a mechanistic insight into how information on letter identity and position is extracted and allow for invariant word recognition, and leads to predictions for reading behavior, error patterns, and the neurophysiology of reading.</description>

      <title>PointSeg: A Training-Free Paradigm for 3D Scene Segmentation via Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent success of vision foundation models have shown promising performance for the 2D perception tasks. However, it is difficult to train a 3D foundation network directly due to the limited dataset and it remains under explored whether existing foundation models can be lifted to 3D space seamlessly. In this paper, we present PointSeg, a novel training-free paradigm that leverages off-the-shelf vision foundation models to address 3D scene perception tasks. PointSeg can segment anything in 3D scene by acquiring accurate 3D prompts to align their corresponding pixels across frames. Concretely, we design a two-branch prompts learning structure to construct the 3D point-box prompts pairs, combining with the bidirectional matching strategy for accurate point and proposal prompts generation. Then, we perform the iterative post-refinement adaptively when cooperated with different vision foundation models. Moreover, we design a affinity-aware merging algorithm to improve the final ensemble masks. PointSeg demonstrates impressive segmentation performance across various datasets, all without training. Specifically, our approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art specialist training-free model by 14.1$\%$, 12.3$\%$, and 12.6$\%$ mAP on ScanNet, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 datasets, respectively. On top of that, PointSeg can incorporate with various foundation models and even surpasses the specialist training-based methods by 3.4$\%$-5.4$\%$ mAP across various datasets, serving as an effective generalist model.</description>

      <title>Dyadic Interaction Modeling for Social Behavior Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human-human communication is like a delicate dance where listeners and speakers concurrently interact to maintain conversational dynamics. Hence, an effective model for generating listener nonverbal behaviors requires understanding the dyadic context and interaction. In this paper, we present an effective framework for creating 3D facial motions in dyadic interactions. Existing work consider a listener as a reactive agent with reflexive behaviors to the speaker's voice and facial motions. The heart of our framework is Dyadic Interaction Modeling (DIM), a pre-training approach that jointly models speakers' and listeners' motions through masking and contrastive learning to learn representations that capture the dyadic context. To enable the generation of non-deterministic behaviors, we encode both listener and speaker motions into discrete latent representations, through VQ-VAE. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned for motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in generating listener motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art according to the quantitative measures capturing the diversity and realism of generated motions. Qualitative results demonstrate the superior capabilities of the proposed approach in generating diverse and realistic expressions, eye blinks and head gestures.

      <title>PYRA: Parallel Yielding Re-Activation for Training-Inference Efficient Task Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09192v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the scale of transformers has grown rapidly, which introduces considerable challenges in terms of training overhead and inference efficiency in the scope of task adaptation. Existing works, namely Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and model compression, have separately investigated the challenges. However, PEFT cannot guarantee the inference efficiency of the original backbone, especially for large-scale models. Model compression requires significant training costs for structure searching and re-training. Consequently, a simple combination of them cannot guarantee accomplishing both training efficiency and inference efficiency with minimal costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Parallel Yielding Re-Activation (PYRA) method for such a challenge of training-inference efficient task adaptation. PYRA first utilizes parallel yielding adaptive weights to comprehensively perceive the data distribution in downstream tasks. A re-activation strategy for token modulation is then applied for tokens to be merged, leading to calibrated token features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PYRA outperforms all competing methods under both low compression rate and high compression rate, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in maintaining both training efficiency and inference efficiency for large-scale foundation models. Our code is available at https://github.com/THU-MIG/PYRA.</description>

      <title>Attention-based Class-Conditioned Alignment for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation of Object Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain adaptation methods for object detection (OD) strive to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts by promoting feature alignment across source and target domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) allows leveraging multiple annotated source datasets and unlabeled target data to improve the accuracy and robustness of the detection model. Most state-of-the-art MSDA methods for OD perform feature alignment in a class-agnostic manner. This is challenging since the objects have unique modal information due to variations in object appearance across domains. A recent prototype-based approach proposed a class-wise alignment, yet it suffers from error accumulation due to noisy pseudo-labels that can negatively affect adaptation with imbalanced data. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-based class-conditioned alignment method for MSDA that aligns instances of each object category across domains. In particular, an attention module coupled with an adversarial domain classifier allows learning domain-invariant and class-specific instance representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking MSDA datasets indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to class imbalance using a conceptually simple class-conditioning method.

      <title>Omni-Recon: Harnessing Image-based Rendering for General-Purpose Neural Radiance Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have sparked significant demand for their integration into real-world 3D applications. However, the varied functionalities required by different 3D applications often necessitate diverse NeRF models with various pipelines, leading to tedious NeRF training for each target task and cumbersome trial-and-error experiments. Drawing inspiration from the generalization capability and adaptability of emerging foundation models, our work aims to develop one general-purpose NeRF for handling diverse 3D tasks. We achieve this by proposing a framework called Omni-Recon, which is capable of (1) generalizable 3D reconstruction and zero-shot multitask scene understanding, and (2) adaptability to diverse downstream 3D applications such as real-time rendering and scene editing. Our key insight is that an image-based rendering pipeline, with accurate geometry and appearance estimation, can lift 2D image features into their 3D counterparts, thus extending widely explored 2D tasks to the 3D world in a generalizable manner. Specifically, our Omni-Recon features a general-purpose NeRF model using image-based rendering with two decoupled branches: one complex transformer-based branch that progressively fuses geometry and appearance features for accurate geometry estimation, and one lightweight branch for predicting blending weights of source views. This design achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalizable 3D surface reconstruction quality with blending weights reusable across diverse tasks for zero-shot multitask scene understanding. In addition, it can enable real-time rendering after baking the complex geometry branch into meshes, swift adaptation to achieve SOTA generalizable 3D understanding performance, and seamless integration with 2D diffusion models for text-guided 3D editing.</description>

      <title>Continual Forgetting for Pre-trained Vision Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For privacy and security concerns, the need to erase unwanted information from pre-trained vision models is becoming evident nowadays. In real-world scenarios, erasure requests originate at any time from both users and model owners. These requests usually form a sequence. Therefore, under such a setting, selective information is expected to be continuously removed from a pre-trained model while maintaining the rest. We define this problem as continual forgetting and identify two key challenges. (i) For unwanted knowledge, efficient and effective deleting is crucial. (ii) For remaining knowledge, the impact brought by the forgetting procedure should be minimal. To address them, we propose Group Sparse LoRA (GS-LoRA). Specifically, towards (i), we use LoRA modules to fine-tune the FFN layers in Transformer blocks for each forgetting task independently, and towards (ii), a simple group sparse regularization is adopted, enabling automatic selection of specific LoRA groups and zeroing out the others. GS-LoRA is effective, parameter-efficient, data-efficient, and easy to implement. We conduct extensive experiments on face recognition, object detection and image classification and demonstrate that GS-LoRA manages to forget specific classes with minimal impact on other classes. Codes will be released on \url{https://github.com/bjzhb666/GS-LoRA}.</description>

      <title>When Do We Not Need Larger Vision Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling up the size of vision models has been the de facto standard to obtain more powerful visual representations. In this work, we discuss the point beyond which larger vision models are not necessary. First, we demonstrate the power of Scaling on Scales (S$^2$), whereby a pre-trained and frozen smaller vision model (e.g., ViT-B or ViT-L), run over multiple image scales, can outperform larger models (e.g., ViT-H or ViT-G) on classification, segmentation, depth estimation, Multimodal LLM (MLLM) benchmarks, and robotic manipulation. Notably, S$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in detailed understanding of MLLM on the V* benchmark, surpassing models such as GPT-4V. We examine the conditions under which S$^2$ is a preferred scaling approach compared to scaling on model size. While larger models have the advantage of better generalization on hard examples, we show that features of larger vision models can be well approximated by those of multi-scale smaller models. This suggests most, if not all, of the representations learned by current large pre-trained models can also be obtained from multi-scale smaller models. Our results show that a multi-scale smaller model has comparable learning capacity to a larger model, and pre-training smaller models with S$^2$ can match or even exceed the advantage of larger models. We release a Python package that can apply S$^2$ on any vision model with one line of code: https://github.com/bfshi/scaling_on_scales.</description>

Abstract: We explore the impact of training with more diverse datasets, characterized by the number of unique samples, on the performance of self-supervised learning (SSL) under a fixed computational budget. Our findings consistently demonstrate that increasing pretraining data diversity enhances SSL performance, albeit only when the distribution distance to the downstream data is minimal. Notably, even with an exceptionally large pretraining data diversity achieved through methods like web crawling or diffusion-generated data, among other ways, the distribution shift remains a challenge. Our experiments are comprehensive with seven SSL methods using large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and YFCC100M amounting to over 200 GPU days.

Abstract: We introduce MVSplat, an efficient model that, given sparse multi-view images as input, predicts clean feed-forward 3D Gaussians. To accurately localize the Gaussian centers, we build a cost volume representation via plane sweeping, where the cross-view feature similarities stored in the cost volume can provide valuable geometry cues to the estimation of depth. We also learn other Gaussian primitives' parameters jointly with the Gaussian centers while only relying on photometric supervision. We demonstrate the importance of the cost volume representation in learning feed-forward Gaussians via extensive experimental evaluations. On the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID benchmarks, MVSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance with the fastest feed-forward inference speed (22~fps). More impressively, compared to the latest state-of-the-art method pixelSplat, MVSplat uses $10\times$ fewer parameters and infers more than $2\times$ faster while providing higher appearance and geometry quality as well as better cross-dataset generalization.</description>

Abstract: The burgeoning integration of 3D medical imaging into healthcare has led to a substantial increase in the workload of medical professionals. To assist clinicians in their diagnostic processes and alleviate their workload, the development of a robust system for retrieving similar case studies presents a viable solution. While the concept holds great promise, the field of 3D medical text-image retrieval is currently limited by the absence of robust evaluation benchmarks and curated datasets. To remedy this, our study presents a groundbreaking dataset, {BIMCV-R}, which includes an extensive collection of 8,069 3D CT volumes, encompassing over 2 million slices, paired with their respective radiological reports. Expanding upon the foundational work of our dataset, we craft a retrieval strategy, MedFinder. This approach employs a dual-stream network architecture, harnessing the potential of large language models to advance the field of medical image retrieval beyond existing text-image retrieval solutions. It marks our preliminary step towards developing a system capable of facilitating text-to-image, image-to-text, and keyword-based retrieval tasks.

      <title>DN-Splatter: Depth and Normal Priors for Gaussian Splatting and Meshing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity 3D reconstruction of common indoor scenes is crucial for VR and AR applications. 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique, has achieved state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results with high rendering speeds and relatively low training times. However, its performance on scenes commonly seen in indoor datasets is poor due to the lack of geometric constraints during optimization. We extend 3D Gaussian splatting with depth and normal cues to tackle challenging indoor datasets and showcase techniques for efficient mesh extraction. Specifically, we regularize the optimization procedure with depth information, enforce local smoothness of nearby Gaussians, and use off-the-shelf monocular networks to achieve better alignment with the true scene geometry. We propose an adaptive depth loss based on the gradient of color images, improving depth estimation and novel view synthesis results over various baselines. Our simple yet effective regularization technique enables direct mesh extraction from the Gaussian representation, yielding more physically accurate reconstructions of indoor scenes. Our code will be released in https://github.com/maturk/dn-splatter.</description>

      <title>Efficient Image Pre-Training with Siamese Cropped Masked Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training of image encoders is omnipresent in the literature, particularly following the introduction of Masked autoencoders (MAE). Current efforts attempt to learn object-centric representations from motion in videos. In particular, SiamMAE recently introduced a Siamese network, training a shared-weight encoder from two frames of a video with a high asymmetric masking ratio (95%). In this work, we propose CropMAE, an alternative approach to the Siamese pre-training introduced by SiamMAE. Our method specifically differs by exclusively considering pairs of cropped images sourced from the same image but cropped differently, deviating from the conventional pairs of frames extracted from a video. CropMAE therefore alleviates the need for video datasets, while maintaining competitive performances and drastically reducing pre-training and learning time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CropMAE learns similar object-centric representations without explicit motion, showing that current self-supervised learning methods do not learn such representations from explicit object motion, but rather thanks to the implicit image transformations that occur between the two views. Finally, CropMAE achieves the highest masking ratio to date (98.5%), enabling the reconstruction of images using only two visible patches. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexandre-eymael/CropMAE.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Near-Field Lighting for Monocular Depth Estimation from Endoscopy Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation in endoscopy videos can enable assistive and robotic surgery to obtain better coverage of the organ and detection of various health issues. Despite promising progress on mainstream, natural image depth estimation, techniques perform poorly on endoscopy images due to a lack of strong geometric features and challenging illumination effects. In this paper, we utilize the photometric cues, i.e., the light emitted from an endoscope and reflected by the surface, to improve monocular depth estimation. We first create two novel loss functions with supervised and self-supervised variants that utilize a per-pixel shading representation. We then propose a novel depth refinement network (PPSNet) that leverages the same per-pixel shading representation. Finally, we introduce teacher-student transfer learning to produce better depth maps from both synthetic data with supervision and clinical data with self-supervision. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the C3VD dataset while estimating high-quality depth maps from clinical data. Our code, pre-trained models, and supplementary materials can be found on our project page: https://ppsnet.github.io/</description>

      <title>NeuroPictor: Refining fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction via Multi-individual Pretraining and Multi-level Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent fMRI-to-image approaches mainly focused on associating fMRI signals with specific conditions of pre-trained diffusion models. These approaches, while producing high-quality images, capture only a limited aspect of the complex information in fMRI signals and offer little detailed control over image creation. In contrast, this paper proposes to directly modulate the generation process of diffusion models using fMRI signals. Our approach, NeuroPictor, divides the fMRI-to-image process into three steps: i) fMRI calibrated-encoding, to tackle multi-individual pre-training for a shared latent space to minimize individual difference and enable the subsequent multi-subject training; ii) fMRI-to-image multi-subject pre-training, perceptually learning to guide diffusion model with high- and low-level conditions across different individuals; iii) fMRI-to-image single-subject refining, similar with step ii but focus on adapting to particular individual. NeuroPictor extracts high-level semantic features from fMRI signals that characterizing the visual stimulus and incrementally fine-tunes the diffusion model with a low-level manipulation network to provide precise structural instructions. By training with about 67,000 fMRI-image pairs from various individuals, our model enjoys superior fMRI-to-image decoding capacity, particularly in the within-subject setting, as evidenced in benchmark datasets. Our code and model are available at https://jingyanghuo.github.io/neuropictor/.</description>

      <title>NeRF-MAE: Masked AutoEncoders for Self-Supervised 3D Representation Learning for Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural fields excel in computer vision and robotics due to their ability to understand the 3D visual world such as inferring semantics, geometry, and dynamics. Given the capabilities of neural fields in densely representing a 3D scene from 2D images, we ask the question: Can we scale their self-supervised pretraining, specifically using masked autoencoders, to generate effective 3D representations from posed RGB images. Owing to the astounding success of extending transformers to novel data modalities, we employ standard 3D Vision Transformers to suit the unique formulation of NeRFs. We leverage NeRF's volumetric grid as a dense input to the transformer, contrasting it with other 3D representations such as pointclouds where the information density can be uneven, and the representation is irregular. Due to the difficulty of applying masked autoencoders to an implicit representation, such as NeRF, we opt for extracting an explicit representation that canonicalizes scenes across domains by employing the camera trajectory for sampling. Our goal is made possible by masking random patches from NeRF's radiance and density grid and employing a standard 3D Swin Transformer to reconstruct the masked patches. In doing so, the model can learn the semantic and spatial structure of complete scenes. We pretrain this representation at scale on our proposed curated posed-RGB data, totaling over 1.8 million images. Once pretrained, the encoder is used for effective 3D transfer learning. Our novel self-supervised pretraining for NeRFs, NeRF-MAE, scales remarkably well and improves performance on various challenging 3D tasks. Utilizing unlabeled posed 2D data for pretraining, NeRF-MAE significantly outperforms self-supervised 3D pretraining and NeRF scene understanding baselines on Front3D and ScanNet datasets with an absolute performance improvement of over 20% AP50 and 8% AP25 for 3D object detection.</description>

      <title>Which Model Generated This Image? A Model-Agnostic Approach for Origin Attribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in visual generative models enables the generation of high-quality images. To prevent the misuse of generated images, it is important to identify the origin model that generates them. In this work, we study the origin attribution of generated images in a practical setting where only a few images generated by a source model are available and the source model cannot be accessed. The goal is to check if a given image is generated by the source model. We first formulate this problem as a few-shot one-class classification task. To solve the task, we propose OCC-CLIP, a CLIP-based framework for few-shot one-class classification, enabling the identification of an image's source model, even among multiple candidates. Extensive experiments corresponding to various generative models verify the effectiveness of our OCC-CLIP framework. Furthermore, an experiment based on the recently released DALL-E 3 API verifies the real-world applicability of our solution.</description>

      <title>Faster Diffusion via Temporal Attention Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of attention mechanism during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%. The code of TGATE is available at https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/T-GATE.</description>

      <title>Per-Gaussian Embedding-Based Deformation for Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provides fast and high-quality novel view synthesis, it is a natural extension to deform a canonical 3DGS to multiple frames for representing a dynamic scene. However, previous works fail to accurately reconstruct complex dynamic scenes. We attribute the failure to the design of the deformation field, which is built as a coordinate-based function. This approach is problematic because 3DGS is a mixture of multiple fields centered at the Gaussians, not just a single coordinate-based framework. To resolve this problem, we define the deformation as a function of per-Gaussian embeddings and temporal embeddings. Moreover, we decompose deformations as coarse and fine deformations to model slow and fast movements, respectively. Also, we introduce a local smoothness regularization for per-Gaussian embedding to improve the details in dynamic regions. Project page: https://jeongminb.github.io/e-d3dgs/</description>

      <title>Multi-Label Continual Learning for the Medical Domain: A Novel Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the critical importance of the medical domain in Deep Learning, most of the research in this area solely focuses on training models in static environments. It is only in recent years that research has begun to address dynamic environments and tackle the Catastrophic Forgetting problem through Continual Learning (CL) techniques. Previous studies have primarily focused on scenarios such as Domain Incremental Learning and Class Incremental Learning, which do not fully capture the complexity of real-world applications. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel benchmark combining the challenges of new class arrivals and domain shifts in a single framework, by considering the New Instances and New Classes (NIC) scenario. This benchmark aims to model a realistic CL setting for the multi-label classification problem in medical imaging. Additionally, it encompasses a greater number of tasks compared to previously tested scenarios. Specifically, our benchmark consists of two datasets (NIH and CXP), nineteen classes, and seven tasks, a stream longer than the previously tested ones. To solve common challenges (e.g., the task inference problem) found in the CIL and NIC scenarios, we propose a novel approach called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation (RCLP). Our method surpasses existing approaches, exhibiting superior performance with minimal forgetting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address prevailing challenges of the brain-powered research, departing from the observation that the literature hardly recover accurate spatial information and require subject-specific models. To address these challenges, we propose UMBRAE, a unified multimodal decoding of brain signals. First, to extract instance-level conceptual and spatial details from neural signals, we introduce an efficient universal brain encoder for multimodal-brain alignment and recover object descriptions at multiple levels of granularity from subsequent multimodal large language model (MLLM). Second, we introduce a cross-subject training strategy mapping subject-specific features to a common feature space. This allows a model to be trained on multiple subjects without extra resources, even yielding superior results compared to subject-specific models. Further, we demonstrate this supports weakly-supervised adaptation to new subjects, with only a fraction of the total training data. Experiments demonstrate that UMBRAE not only achieves superior results in the newly introduced tasks but also outperforms methods in well established tasks. To assess our method, we construct and share with the community a comprehensive brain understanding benchmark BrainHub. Our code and benchmark are available at https://weihaox.github.io/UMBRAE.</description>

      <title>SPAMming Labels: Efficient Annotations for the Trackers of Tomorrow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing the annotation efficiency of trajectory annotations from videos has the potential to enable the next generation of data-hungry tracking algorithms to thrive on large-scale datasets. Despite the importance of this task, there are currently very few works exploring how to efficiently label tracking datasets comprehensively. In this work, we introduce SPAM, a video label engine that provides high-quality labels with minimal human intervention. SPAM is built around two key insights: i) most tracking scenarios can be easily resolved. To take advantage of this, we utilize a pre-trained model to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, reserving human involvement for a smaller subset of more difficult instances; ii) handling the spatiotemporal dependencies of track annotations across time can be elegantly and efficiently formulated through graphs. Therefore, we use a unified graph formulation to address the annotation of both detections and identity association for tracks across time. Based on these insights, SPAM produces high-quality annotations with a fraction of ground truth labeling cost. We demonstrate that trackers trained on SPAM labels achieve comparable performance to those trained on human annotations while requiring only $3-20\%$ of the human labeling effort. Hence, SPAM paves the way towards highly efficient labeling of large-scale tracking datasets. We release all models and code.</description>

Abstract: We revisit Tree-Ring Watermarking, a recent diffusion model watermarking method that demonstrates great robustness to various attacks. We conduct an in-depth study on it and reveal that the distribution shift unintentionally introduced by the watermarking process, apart from watermark pattern matching, contributes to its exceptional robustness. Our investigation further exposes inherent flaws in its original design, particularly in its ability to identify multiple distinct keys, where distribution shift offers no assistance. Based on these findings and analysis, we present RingID for enhanced multi-key identification. It consists of a novel multi-channel heterogeneous watermarking approach designed to seamlessly amalgamate distinctive advantages from diverse watermarks. Coupled with a series of suggested enhancements, RingID exhibits substantial advancements in multi-key identification. Github Page: https://github.com/showlab/RingID</description>

      <title>ODMixer: Fine-grained Spatial-temporal MLP for Metro Origin-Destination Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metro Origin-Destination (OD) prediction is a crucial yet challenging spatial-temporal prediction task in urban computing, which aims to accurately forecast cross-station ridership for optimizing metro scheduling and enhancing overall transport efficiency. Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro OD prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we analyze traffic variations from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer. Our code is available at https://github.com/KLatitude/ODMixer.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in self-supervised learning in the point cloud domain have demonstrated significant potential. However, these methods often suffer from drawbacks, including lengthy pre-training time, the necessity of reconstruction in the input space, or the necessity of additional modalities. In order to address these issues, we introduce Point-JEPA, a joint embedding predictive architecture designed specifically for point cloud data. To this end, we introduce a sequencer that orders point cloud tokens to efficiently compute and utilize tokens proximity based on their indices during target and context selection. The sequencer also allows shared computations of the tokens proximity between context and target selection, further improving the efficiency. Experimentally, our method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods while avoiding the reconstruction in the input space or additional modality.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Robust to Object Motion Blur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving objects are frequently seen in daily life and usually appear blurred in images due to their motion. While general object retrieval is a widely explored area in computer vision, it primarily focuses on sharp and static objects, and retrieval of motion-blurred objects in large image collections remains unexplored. We propose a method for object retrieval in images that are affected by motion blur. The proposed method learns a robust representation capable of matching blurred objects to their deblurred versions and vice versa. To evaluate our approach, we present the first large-scale datasets for blurred object retrieval, featuring images with objects exhibiting varying degrees of blur in various poses and scales. We conducted extensive experiments, showing that our method outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods on the new blur-retrieval datasets, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code, data, and model are available at https://github.com/Rong-Zou/Retrieval-Robust-to-Object-Motion-Blur.</description>

      <title>Feature-Aware Noise Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Red Panda Re-Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To facilitate the re-identification (re-ID) of individual animals, existing methods primarily focus on maximizing feature similarity within the same individual and enhancing distinctiveness between different individuals. However, most of them still rely on supervised learning and require substantial labeled data, which is challenging to obtain. To avoid this issue, we propose Feature-Aware Noise Contrastive Learning (FANCL) method to explore an unsupervised learning solution, which is then validated on the task of red panda re-ID. FANCL designs a Feature-Aware Noise Addition module to produce noised images that conceal critical features, and employs two contrastive learning modules to calculate the losses. Firstly, a feature consistency module is designed to bridge the gap between the original and noised features. Secondly, the neural networks are trained through a cluster contrastive learning module. Through these more challenging learning tasks, FANCL can adaptively extract deeper representations of red pandas. The experimental results on a set of red panda images collected in both indoor and outdoor environments prove that FANCL outperforms several related state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving high performance comparable to supervised learning methods.</description>

      <title>Power Variable Projection for Initialization-Free Large-Scale Bundle Adjustment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most Bundle Adjustment (BA) solvers like the Levenberg-Marquard algorithm require a good initialization. Instead, initialization-free BA remains a largely uncharted territory. The under-explored Variable Projection algorithm (VarPro) exhibits a wide convergence basin even without initialization. Coupled with object space error formulation, recent works have shown its ability to solve small-scale initialization-free bundle adjustment problem. To make such initialization-free BA approaches scalable, we introduce Power Variable Projection (PoVar), extending a recent inverse expansion method based on power series. Importantly, we link the power series expansion to Riemannian manifold optimization. This projective framework is crucial to solve large-scale bundle adjustment problems without initialization. Using the real-world BAL dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that our solver achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of speed and accuracy. To our knowledge, this work is the first to address the scalability of BA without initialization opening new venues for initialization-free structure-from-motion.</description>

      <title>Distilling Diffusion Models into Conditional GANs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to distill a complex multistep diffusion model into a single-step conditional GAN student model, dramatically accelerating inference, while preserving image quality. Our approach interprets diffusion distillation as a paired image-to-image translation task, using noise-to-image pairs of the diffusion model's ODE trajectory. For efficient regression loss computation, we propose E-LatentLPIPS, a perceptual loss operating directly in diffusion model's latent space, utilizing an ensemble of augmentations. Furthermore, we adapt a diffusion model to construct a multi-scale discriminator with a text alignment loss to build an effective conditional GAN-based formulation. E-LatentLPIPS converges more efficiently than many existing distillation methods, even accounting for dataset construction costs. We demonstrate that our one-step generator outperforms cutting-edge one-step diffusion distillation models -- DMD, SDXL-Turbo, and SDXL-Lightning -- on the zero-shot COCO benchmark.</description>

      <title>Context-Guided Spatial Feature Reconstruction for Efficient Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is an important task for numerous applications but it is still quite challenging to achieve advanced performance with limited computational costs. In this paper, we present CGRSeg, an efficient yet competitive segmentation framework based on context-guided spatial feature reconstruction. A Rectangular Self-Calibration Module is carefully designed for spatial feature reconstruction and pyramid context extraction. It captures the axial global context in both horizontal and vertical directions to explicitly model rectangular key areas. A shape self-calibration function is designed to make the key areas closer to foreground objects. Besides, a lightweight Dynamic Prototype Guided head is proposed to improve the classification of foreground objects by explicit class embedding. Our CGRSeg is extensively evaluated on ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Pascal Context benchmarks, and achieves state-of-the-art semantic performance. Specifically, it achieves $43.6\%$ mIoU on ADE20K with only $4.0$ GFLOPs, which is $0.9\%$ and $2.5\%$ mIoU better than SeaFormer and SegNeXt but with about $38.0\%$ fewer GFLOPs. Code is available at https://github.com/nizhenliang/CGRSeg.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study and Analysis of Text-to-Image Generation Using Large Language Model-Powered Textual Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One critical prerequisite for faithful text-to-image generation is the accurate understanding of text inputs. Existing methods leverage the text encoder of the CLIP model to represent input prompts. However, the pre-trained CLIP model can merely encode English with a maximum token length of 77. Moreover, the model capacity of the text encoder from CLIP is relatively limited compared to Large Language Models (LLMs), which offer multilingual input, accommodate longer context, and achieve superior text representation. In this paper, we investigate LLMs as the text encoder to improve the language understanding in text-to-image generation. Unfortunately, training text-to-image generative model with LLMs from scratch demands significant computational resources and data. To this end, we introduce a three-stage training pipeline that effectively and efficiently integrates the existing text-to-image model with LLMs. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter that enables fast training of the text-to-image model using the textual representations from LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model supports not only multilingual but also longer input context with superior image generation quality.</description>

      <title>PoseCrafter: One-Shot Personalized Video Synthesis Following Flexible Pose Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PoseCrafter, a one-shot method for personalized video generation following the control of flexible poses. Built upon Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, we carefully design an inference process to produce high-quality videos without the corresponding ground-truth frames. First, we select an appropriate reference frame from the training video and invert it to initialize all latent variables for generation. Then, we insert the corresponding training pose into the target pose sequences to enhance faithfulness through a trained temporal attention module. Furthermore, to alleviate the face and hand degradation resulting from discrepancies between poses of training videos and inference poses, we implement simple latent editing through an affine transformation matrix involving facial and hand landmarks. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that PoseCrafter achieves superior results to baselines pre-trained on a vast collection of videos under 8 commonly used metrics. Besides, PoseCrafter can follow poses from different individuals or artificial edits and simultaneously retain the human identity in an open-domain training video. Our project page is available at https://ml-gsai.github.io/PoseCrafter-demo/.</description>

      <title>View-Consistent Hierarchical 3D Segmentation Using Ultrametric Feature Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as Segment Anything (SAM) demonstrate impressive performance in zero-shot image segmentation at multiple levels of granularity. However, these zero-shot predictions are rarely 3D-consistent. As the camera viewpoint changes in a scene, so do the segmentation predictions, as well as the characterizations of "coarse" or "fine" granularity. In this work, we address the challenging task of lifting multi-granular and view-inconsistent image segmentations into a hierarchical and 3D-consistent representation. We learn a novel feature field within a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representing a 3D scene, whose segmentation structure can be revealed at different scales by simply using different thresholds on feature distance. Our key idea is to learn an ultrametric feature space, which unlike a Euclidean space, exhibits transitivity in distance-based grouping, naturally leading to a hierarchical clustering. Put together, our method takes view-inconsistent multi-granularity 2D segmentations as input and produces a hierarchy of 3D-consistent segmentations as output. We evaluate our method and several baselines on synthetic datasets with multi-view images and multi-granular segmentation, showcasing improved accuracy and viewpoint-consistency. We additionally provide qualitative examples of our model's 3D hierarchical segmentations in real world scenes. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/hardyho/ultrametric_feature_fields</description>

      <title>MoLA: Motion Generation and Editing with Latent Diffusion Enhanced by Adversarial Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In motion generation, controllability as well as generation quality and speed is becoming more and more important. There are various motion editing tasks, such as in-betweening, upper body editing, and path-following, but existing methods perform motion editing with a data-space diffusion model, which is slow in inference compared to a latent diffusion model. In this paper, we propose MoLA, which provides fast and high-quality motion generation and also can deal with multiple editing tasks in a single framework. For high-quality and fast generation, we employ a variational autoencoder and latent diffusion model, and improve the performance with adversarial training. In addition, we apply a training-free guided generation framework to achieve various editing tasks with motion control inputs. We quantitatively show the effectiveness of adversarial learning in text-to-motion generation, and demonstrate the applicability of our editing framework to multiple editing tasks in the motion domain.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Refined VQA Annotations for Semi-Supervised Gaze Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training gaze following models requires a large number of images with gaze target coordinates annotated by human annotators, which is a laborious and inherently ambiguous process. We propose the first semi-supervised method for gaze following by introducing two novel priors to the task. We obtain the first prior using a large pretrained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model, where we compute Grad-CAM heatmaps by `prompting' the VQA model with a gaze following question. These heatmaps can be noisy and not suited for use in training. The need to refine these noisy annotations leads us to incorporate a second prior. We utilize a diffusion model trained on limited human annotations and modify the reverse sampling process to refine the Grad-CAM heatmaps. By tuning the diffusion process we achieve a trade-off between the human annotation prior and the VQA heatmap prior, which retains the useful VQA prior information while exhibiting similar properties to the training data distribution. Our method outperforms simple pseudo-annotation generation baselines on the GazeFollow image dataset. More importantly, our pseudo-annotation strategy, applied to a widely used supervised gaze following model (VAT), reduces the annotation need by 50%. Our method also performs the best on the VideoAttentionTarget dataset.</description>

      <title>Labeled Data Selection for Category Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Category discovery methods aim to find novel categories in unlabeled visual data. At training time, a set of labeled and unlabeled images are provided, where the labels correspond to the categories present in the images. The labeled data provides guidance during training by indicating what types of visual properties and features are relevant for performing discovery in the unlabeled data. As a result, changing the categories present in the labeled set can have a large impact on what is ultimately discovered in the unlabeled set. Despite its importance, the impact of labeled data selection has not been explored in the category discovery literature to date. We show that changing the labeled data can significantly impact discovery performance. Motivated by this, we propose two new approaches for automatically selecting the most suitable labeled data based on the similarity between the labeled and unlabeled data. Our observation is that, unlike in conventional supervised transfer learning, the best labeled is neither too similar, nor too dissimilar, to the unlabeled categories. Our resulting approaches obtains state-of-the-art discovery performance across a range of challenging fine-grained benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Efficient Model Evaluation through Stratification, Sampling, and Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model performance evaluation is a critical and expensive task in machine learning and computer vision. Without clear guidelines, practitioners often estimate model accuracy using a one-time completely random selection of the data. However, by employing tailored sampling and estimation strategies, one can obtain more precise estimates and reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework for model evaluation that includes stratification, sampling, and estimation components. We examine the statistical properties of each component and evaluate their efficiency (precision). One key result of our work is that stratification via k-means clustering based on accurate predictions of model performance yields efficient estimators. Our experiments on computer vision datasets show that this method consistently provides more precise accuracy estimates than the traditional simple random sampling, even with substantial efficiency gains of 10x. We also find that model-assisted estimators, which leverage predictions of model accuracy on the unlabeled portion of the dataset, are generally more efficient than the traditional estimates based solely on the labeled data.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Weight Space of Customized Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the space of weights spanned by a large collection of customized diffusion models. We populate this space by creating a dataset of over 60,000 models, each of which is a base model fine-tuned to insert a different person's visual identity. We model the underlying manifold of these weights as a subspace, which we term weights2weights. We demonstrate three immediate applications of this space -- sampling, editing, and inversion. First, as each point in the space corresponds to an identity, sampling a set of weights from it results in a model encoding a novel identity. Next, we find linear directions in this space corresponding to semantic edits of the identity (e.g., adding a beard). These edits persist in appearance across generated samples. Finally, we show that inverting a single image into this space reconstructs a realistic identity, even if the input image is out of distribution (e.g., a painting). Our results indicate that the weight space of fine-tuned diffusion models behaves as an interpretable latent space of identities.</description>

      <title>MVSBoost: An Efficient Point Cloud-based 3D Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction is crucial for various applications, including augmented and virtual reality, medical imaging, and cinematic special effects. While traditional Multi-View Stereo (MVS) systems have been fundamental in these applications, using neural implicit fields in implicit 3D scene modeling has introduced new possibilities for handling complex topologies and continuous surfaces. However, neural implicit fields often suffer from computational inefficiencies, overfitting, and heavy reliance on data quality, limiting their practical use. This paper presents an enhanced MVS framework that integrates multi-view 360-degree imagery with robust camera pose estimation via Structure from Motion (SfM) and advanced image processing for point cloud densification, mesh reconstruction, and texturing. Our approach significantly improves upon traditional MVS methods, offering superior accuracy and precision as validated using Chamfer distance metrics on the Realistic Synthetic 360 dataset. The developed MVS technique enhances the detail and clarity of 3D reconstructions and demonstrates superior computational efficiency and robustness in complex scene reconstruction, effectively handling occlusions and varying viewpoints. These improvements suggest that our MVS framework can compete with and potentially exceed current state-of-the-art neural implicit field methods, especially in scenarios requiring real-time processing and scalability.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Analyzing Relationship Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The issue of hallucinations is a prevalent concern in existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Previous efforts have primarily focused on investigating object hallucinations, which can be easily alleviated by introducing object detectors. However, these efforts neglect hallucinations in inter-object relationships, which is essential for visual comprehension. In this work, we introduce R-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating Vision Relationship Hallucination. R-Bench features image-level questions that focus on the existence of relationships and instance-level questions that assess local visual comprehension. We identify three types of relationship co-occurrences that lead to hallucinations: relationship-relationship, subject-relationship, and relationship-object. The visual instruction tuning dataset's long-tail distribution significantly impacts LVLMs' understanding of visual relationships. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current LVLMs tend to disregard visual content and overly rely on the common sense knowledge of Large Language Models. They also struggle with reasoning about spatial relationships based on contextual information.</description>

      <title>AnyControl: Create Your Artwork with Versatile Control on Text-to-Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of text-to-image (T2I) generation has made significant progress in recent years, largely driven by advancements in diffusion models. Linguistic control enables effective content creation, but struggles with fine-grained control over image generation. This challenge has been explored, to a great extent, by incorporating additional user-supplied spatial conditions, such as depth maps and edge maps, into pre-trained T2I models through extra encoding. However, multi-control image synthesis still faces several challenges. Specifically, current approaches are limited in handling free combinations of diverse input control signals, overlook the complex relationships among multiple spatial conditions, and often fail to maintain semantic alignment with provided textual prompts. This can lead to suboptimal user experiences. To address these challenges, we propose AnyControl, a multi-control image synthesis framework that supports arbitrary combinations of diverse control signals. AnyControl develops a novel Multi-Control Encoder that extracts a unified multi-modal embedding to guide the generation process. This approach enables a holistic understanding of user inputs, and produces high-quality, faithful results under versatile control signals, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our project page is available in https://any-control.github.io.</description>

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in medical imaging remain critical challenges in healthcare. This paper introduces Spatial-MSMA (Multiscale Score Matching Analysis), a novel unsupervised method for anomaly localization in volumetric brain MRIs. Building upon the MSMA framework, our approach incorporates spatial information and conditional likelihoods to enhance anomaly detection capabilities. We employ a flexible normalizing flow model conditioned on patch positions and global image features to estimate patch-wise anomaly scores. The method is evaluated on a dataset of 1,650 T1- and T2-weighted brain MRIs from typically developing children, with simulated lesions added to the test set. Spatial-MSMA significantly outperforms existing methods, including reconstruction-based, generative-based, and interpretation-based approaches, in lesion detection and segmentation tasks. Our model achieves superior performance in both distance-based metrics (99th percentile Hausdorff Distance: $7.05 \pm 0.61$, Mean Surface Distance: $2.10 \pm 0.43$) and component-wise metrics (True Positive Rate: $0.83 \pm 0.01$, Positive Predictive Value: $0.96 \pm 0.01$). These results demonstrate Spatial-MSMA's potential for accurate and interpretable anomaly localization in medical imaging, with implications for improved diagnosis and treatment planning in clinical settings.

      <title>BEVWorld: A Multimodal World Model for Autonomous Driving via Unified BEV Latent Space</title>

Abstract: World models are receiving increasing attention in autonomous driving for their ability to predict potential future scenarios. In this paper, we present BEVWorld, a novel approach that tokenizes multimodal sensor inputs into a unified and compact Bird's Eye View (BEV) latent space for environment modeling. The world model consists of two parts: the multi-modal tokenizer and the latent BEV sequence diffusion model. The multi-modal tokenizer first encodes multi-modality information and the decoder is able to reconstruct the latent BEV tokens into LiDAR and image observations by ray-casting rendering in a self-supervised manner. Then the latent BEV sequence diffusion model predicts future scenarios given action tokens as conditions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BEVWorld in autonomous driving tasks, showcasing its capability in generating future scenes and benefiting downstream tasks such as perception and motion prediction. Code will be available at https://github.com/zympsyche/BevWorld.</description>

      <title>Powerful and Flexible: Personalized Text-to-Image Generation via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models allow users to generate varied styles of images (specified with a sentence) for an object (specified with a set of reference images). While remarkable results have been achieved using diffusion-based generation models, the visual structure and details of the object are often unexpectedly changed during the diffusion process. One major reason is that these diffusion-based approaches typically adopt a simple reconstruction objective during training, which can hardly enforce appropriate structural consistency between the generated and the reference images. To this end, in this paper, we design a novel reinforcement learning framework by utilizing the deterministic policy gradient method for personalized text-to-image generation, with which various objectives, differential or even non-differential, can be easily incorporated to supervise the diffusion models to improve the quality of the generated images. Experimental results on personalized text-to-image generation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on visual fidelity while maintaining text-alignment.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is crucial for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and serves as a foundation for various applications that bridge cyberspace and the physical world. Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for the brain of embodied agents. However, there is no comprehensive survey for Embodied AI in the era of MLMs. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations. Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2) embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation, covering the state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions in dynamic digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss their potential future directions. We hope this survey will serve as a foundational reference for the research community and inspire continued innovation.

      <description>arXiv:2407.07042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a new framework, ProtoSAM, for one-shot medical image segmentation. It combines the use of prototypical networks, known for few-shot segmentation, with SAM - a natural image foundation model. The method proposed creates an initial coarse segmentation mask using the ALPnet prototypical network, augmented with a DINOv2 encoder. Following the extraction of an initial mask, prompts are extracted, such as points and bounding boxes, which are then input into the Segment Anything Model (SAM). State-of-the-art results are shown on several medical image datasets and demonstrate automated segmentation capabilities using a single image example (one shot) with no need for fine-tuning of the foundation model.

      <title>SRPose: Two-view Relative Pose Estimation with Sparse Keypoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-view pose estimation is essential for map-free visual relocalization and object pose tracking tasks. However, traditional matching methods suffer from time-consuming robust estimators, while deep learning-based pose regressors only cater to camera-to-world pose estimation, lacking generalizability to different image sizes and camera intrinsics. In this paper, we propose SRPose, a sparse keypoint-based framework for two-view relative pose estimation in camera-to-world and object-to-camera scenarios. SRPose consists of a sparse keypoint detector, an intrinsic-calibration position encoder, and promptable prior knowledge-guided attention layers. Given two RGB images of a fixed scene or a moving object, SRPose estimates the relative camera or 6D object pose transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRPose achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed, showing generalizability to both scenarios. It is robust to different image sizes and camera intrinsics, and can be deployed with low computing resources.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Thermal Infrared Tracking with Natural Language Modeling and Coordinate Sequence Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal infrared tracking is an essential topic in computer vision tasks because of its advantage of all-weather imaging. However, most conventional methods utilize only hand-crafted features, while deep learning-based correlation filtering methods are limited by simple correlation operations. Transformer-based methods ignore temporal and coordinate information, which is critical for TIR tracking that lacks texture and color information. In this paper, to address these issues, we apply natural language modeling to TIR tracking and propose a novel model called NLMTrack, which enhances the utilization of coordinate and temporal information. NLMTrack applies an encoder that unifies feature extraction and feature fusion, which simplifies the TIR tracking pipeline. To address the challenge of low detail and low contrast in TIR images, on the one hand, we design a multi-level progressive fusion module that enhances the semantic representation and incorporates multi-scale features. On the other hand, the decoder combines the TIR features and the coordinate sequence features using a causal transformer to generate the target sequence step by step. Moreover, we explore an adaptive loss aimed at elevating tracking accuracy and a simple template update strategy to accommodate the target's appearance variations. Experiments show that NLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. The Code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ELOESZHANG/NLMTrack}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) involves adapting a pre-trained source model to continually changing unsupervised target domains. In this paper, we systematically analyze the challenges of this task: online environment, unsupervised nature, and the risks of error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting under continual domain shifts. To address these challenges, we reshape the online data buffering and organizing mechanism for CTTA. We propose an uncertainty-aware buffering approach to identify and aggregate significant samples with high certainty from the unsupervised, single-pass data stream. Based on this, we propose a graph-based class relation preservation constraint to overcome catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, a pseudo-target replay objective is used to mitigate error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in both segmentation and classification CTTA tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/z1358/OBAO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating canopy height and canopy height change at meter resolution from satellite imagery has numerous applications, such as monitoring forest health, logging activities, wood resources, and carbon stocks. However, many existing forest datasets are based on commercial or closed data sources, restricting the reproducibility and evaluation of new approaches. To address this gap, we introduce Open-Canopy, the first open-access and country-scale benchmark for very high resolution (1.5 m) canopy height estimation. Covering more than 87,000 km$^2$ across France, Open-Canopy combines SPOT satellite imagery with high resolution aerial LiDAR data. We also propose Open-Canopy-$\Delta$, the first benchmark for canopy height change detection between two images taken at different years, a particularly challenging task even for recent models. To establish a robust foundation for these benchmarks, we evaluate a comprehensive list of state-of-the-art computer vision models for canopy height estimation. The dataset and associated codes can be accessed at https://github.com/fajwel/Open-Canopy.</description>

      <title>AccDiffusion: An Accurate Method for Higher-Resolution Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper attempts to address the object repetition issue in patch-wise higher-resolution image generation. We propose AccDiffusion, an accurate method for patch-wise higher-resolution image generation without training. An in-depth analysis in this paper reveals an identical text prompt for different patches causes repeated object generation, while no prompt compromises the image details. Therefore, our AccDiffusion, for the first time, proposes to decouple the vanilla image-content-aware prompt into a set of patch-content-aware prompts, each of which serves as a more precise description of an image patch. Besides, AccDiffusion also introduces dilated sampling with window interaction for better global consistency in higher-resolution image generation. Experimental comparison with existing methods demonstrates that our AccDiffusion effectively addresses the issue of repeated object generation and leads to better performance in higher-resolution image generation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Vision Language Models for Cultural Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have notably advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their performance has been typically assessed on general scene understanding - recognizing objects, attributes, and actions - rather than cultural comprehension. This study introduces CulturalVQA, a visual question-answering benchmark aimed at assessing VLM's geo-diverse cultural understanding. We curate a collection of 2,378 image-question pairs with 1-5 answers per question representing cultures from 11 countries across 5 continents. The questions probe understanding of various facets of culture such as clothing, food, drinks, rituals, and traditions. Benchmarking VLMs on CulturalVQA, including GPT-4V and Gemini, reveals disparity in their level of cultural understanding across regions, with strong cultural understanding capabilities for North America while significantly lower performance for Africa. We observe disparity in their performance across cultural facets too, with clothing, rituals, and traditions seeing higher performances than food and drink. These disparities help us identify areas where VLMs lack cultural understanding and demonstrate the potential of CulturalVQA as a comprehensive evaluation set for gauging VLM progress in understanding diverse cultures.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained Open Vocabulary Image Classification: Zero-Shot Transfer from Text to Image via CLIP Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce NOVIC, an innovative uNconstrained Open Vocabulary Image Classifier that uses an autoregressive transformer to generatively output classification labels as language. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of CLIP models, NOVIC harnesses the embedding space to enable zero-shot transfer from pure text to images. Traditional CLIP models, despite their ability for open vocabulary classification, require an exhaustive prompt of potential class labels, restricting their application to images of known content or context. To address this, we propose an "object decoder" model that is trained on a large-scale 92M-target dataset of templated object noun sets and LLM-generated captions to always output the object noun in question. This effectively inverts the CLIP text encoder and allows textual object labels to be generated directly from image-derived embedding vectors, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the potential content of an image. The trained decoders are tested on a mix of manually and web-curated datasets, as well as standard image classification benchmarks, and achieve fine-grained prompt-free prediction scores of up to 87.5%, a strong result considering the model must work for any conceivable image and without any contextual clues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing methods enhance open-vocabulary object detection by leveraging the robust open-vocabulary recognition capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP.However, two main challenges emerge:(1) A deficiency in concept representation, where the category names in CLIP's text space lack textual and visual knowledge.(2) An overfitting tendency towards base categories, with the open vocabulary knowledge biased towards base categories during the transfer from VLMs to detectors.To address these challenges, we propose the Language Model Instruction (LaMI) strategy, which leverages the relationships between visual concepts and applies them within a simple yet effective DETR-like detector, termed LaMI-DETR.LaMI utilizes GPT to construct visual concepts and employs T5 to investigate visual similarities across categories.These inter-category relationships refine concept representation and avoid overfitting to base categories.Comprehensive experiments validate our approach's superior performance over existing methods in the same rigorous setting without reliance on external training resources.LaMI-DETR achieves a rare box AP of 43.4 on OV-LVIS, surpassing the previous best by 7.8 rare box AP.</description>

      <title>IPA-NeRF: Illusory Poisoning Attack Against Neural Radiance Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) represents a significant advancement in computer vision, offering implicit neural network-based scene representation and novel view synthesis capabilities. Its applications span diverse fields including robotics, urban mapping, autonomous navigation, virtual reality/augmented reality, etc., some of which are considered high-risk AI applications. However, despite its widespread adoption, the robustness and security of NeRF remain largely unexplored. In this study, we contribute to this area by introducing the Illusory Poisoning Attack against Neural Radiance Fields (IPA-NeRF). This attack involves embedding a hidden backdoor view into NeRF, allowing it to produce predetermined outputs, i.e. illusory, when presented with the specified backdoor view while maintaining normal performance with standard inputs. Our attack is specifically designed to deceive users or downstream models at a particular position while ensuring that any abnormalities in NeRF remain undetectable from other viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our Illusory Poisoning Attack, successfully presenting the desired illusory on the specified viewpoint without impacting other views. Notably, we achieve this attack by introducing small perturbations solely to the training set. The code can be found at https://github.com/jiang-wenxiang/IPA-NeRF.</description>

      <title>Motion-Oriented Compositional Neural Radiance Fields for Monocular Dynamic Human Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Motion-oriented Compositional Neural Radiance Fields (MoCo-NeRF), a framework designed to perform free-viewpoint rendering of monocular human videos via novel non-rigid motion modeling approach. In the context of dynamic clothed humans, complex cloth dynamics generate non-rigid motions that are intrinsically distinct from skeletal articulations and critically important for the rendering quality. The conventional approach models non-rigid motions as spatial (3D) deviations in addition to skeletal transformations. However, it is either time-consuming or challenging to achieve optimal quality due to its high learning complexity without a direct supervision. To target this problem, we propose a novel approach of modeling non-rigid motions as radiance residual fields to benefit from more direct color supervision in the rendering and utilize the rigid radiance fields as a prior to reduce the complexity of the learning process. Our approach utilizes a single multiresolution hash encoding (MHE) to concurrently learn the canonical T-pose representation from rigid skeletal motions and the radiance residual field for non-rigid motions. Additionally, to further improve both training efficiency and usability, we extend MoCo-NeRF to support simultaneous training of multiple subjects within a single framework, thanks to our effective design for modeling non-rigid motions. This scalability is achieved through the integration of a global MHE and learnable identity codes in addition to multiple local MHEs. We present extensive results on ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap, clearly demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both single- and multi-subject settings. The code and model will be made publicly available at the project page: https://stevejaehyeok.github.io/publications/moco-nerf.</description>

Abstract: This study performed an extensive evaluation of the performances of all configurations of YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10 object detection algorithms for fruitlet (of green fruit) detection in commercial orchards. Additionally, this research performed and validated in-field counting of fruitlets using an iPhone and machine vision sensors in 5 different apple varieties (Scifresh, Scilate, Honeycrisp, Cosmic crisp &amp; Golden delicious). This comprehensive investigation of total 17 different configurations (5 for YOLOv8, 6 for YOLOv9 and 6 for YOLOv10) revealed that YOLOv9 outperforms YOLOv10 and YOLOv8 in terms of mAP@50, while YOLOv10x outperformed all 17 configurations tested in terms of precision and recall. Specifically, YOLOv9 Gelan-e achieved the highest mAP@50 of 0.935, outperforming YOLOv10n's 0.921 and YOLOv8s's 0.924. In terms of precision, YOLOv10x achieved the highest precision of 0.908, indicating superior object identification accuracy compared to other configurations tested (e.g. YOLOv9 Gelan-c with a precision of 0.903 and YOLOv8m with 0.897. In terms of recall, YOLOv10s achieved the highest in its series (0.872), while YOLOv9 Gelan m performed the best among YOLOv9 configurations (0.899), and YOLOv8n performed the best among the YOLOv8 configurations (0.883). Meanwhile, three configurations of YOLOv10: YOLOv10b, YOLOv10l, and YOLOv10x achieved superior post-processing speeds of 1.5 milliseconds, outperforming all other configurations within the YOLOv9 and YOLOv8 families. Specifically, YOLOv9 Gelan-e recorded a post-processing speed of 1.9 milliseconds, and YOLOv8m achieved 2.1 milliseconds. Furthermore, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest inference speed among all configurations tested, achieving a processing time of 4.1 milliseconds while YOLOv9 Gelan-t and YOLOv10n also demonstrated comparatively slower inference speeds of 9.3 ms and 5.5 ms, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at Benchmarking Self-Supervised Pre-training with Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning approach where the data itself provides supervision, eliminating the need for external labels. The model is forced to learn about the data structure or context by solving a pretext task. With SSL, models can learn from abundant and cheap unlabeled data, significantly reducing the cost of training models where labels are expensive or inaccessible. In Computer Vision, SSL is widely used as pre-training followed by a downstream task, such as supervised transfer, few-shot learning on smaller labeled data sets, and/or unsupervised clustering. Unfortunately, it is infeasible to evaluate SSL methods on all possible downstream tasks and objectively measure the quality of the learned representation. Instead, SSL methods are evaluated using in-domain evaluation protocols, such as fine-tuning, linear probing, and k-nearest neighbors (kNN). However, it is not well understood how well these evaluation protocols estimate the representation quality of a pre-trained model for different downstream tasks under different conditions, such as dataset, metric, and model architecture. We study how classification-based evaluation protocols for SSL correlate and how well they predict downstream performance on different dataset types. Our study includes eleven common image datasets and 26 models that were pre-trained with different SSL methods or have different model backbones. We find that in-domain linear/kNN probing protocols are, on average, the best general predictors for out-of-domain performance. We further investigate the importance of batch normalization and evaluate how robust correlations are for different kinds of dataset domain shifts. We challenge assumptions about the relationship between discriminative and generative self-supervised methods, finding that most of their performance differences can be explained by changes to model backbones.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-Powered Video Assistant Referee System (VARS) for Association Football</title>

Abstract: Over the past decade, the technology used by referees in football has improved substantially, enhancing the fairness and accuracy of decisions. This progress has culminated in the implementation of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), an innovation that enables backstage referees to review incidents on the pitch from multiple points of view. However, the VAR is currently limited to professional leagues due to its expensive infrastructure and the lack of referees worldwide. In this paper, we present the semi-automated Video Assistant Referee System (VARS) that leverages the latest findings in multi-view video analysis. VARS sets a new state-of-the-art on the SoccerNet-MVFoul dataset, a multi-view video dataset of football fouls. Our VARS achieves a new state-of-the-art on the SoccerNet-MVFoul dataset by recognizing the type of foul in 50% of instances and the appropriate sanction in 46% of cases. Finally, we conducted a comparative study to investigate human performance in classifying fouls and their corresponding severity and compared these findings to our VARS. The results of our study highlight the potential of our VARS to reach human performance and support football refereeing across all levels of professional and amateur federations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Robust Self-Supervised Learning Across Diverse Downstream Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale vision models have become integral in many applications due to their unprecedented performance and versatility across downstream tasks. However, the robustness of these foundation models has primarily been explored for a single task, namely image classification. The vulnerability of other common vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, remains largely unknown. We present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the adversarial robustness of self-supervised vision encoders across multiple downstream tasks. Our attacks operate in the encoder embedding space and at the downstream task output level. In both cases, current state-of-the-art adversarial fine-tuning techniques tested only for classification significantly degrade clean and robust performance on other tasks. Since the purpose of a foundation model is to cater to multiple applications at once, our findings reveal the need to enhance encoder robustness more broadly. Our code is available at ${github.com/layer6ai-labs/ssl-robustness}$.</description>

Abstract: 3D reverse engineering, in which a CAD model is inferred given a 3D scan of a physical object, is a research direction that offers many promising practical applications. This paper proposes TransCAD, an end-to-end transformer-based architecture that predicts the CAD sequence from a point cloud. TransCAD leverages the structure of CAD sequences by using a hierarchical learning strategy. A loop refiner is also introduced to regress sketch primitive parameters. Rigorous experimentation on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that TransCAD achieves state-of-the-art results. The result analysis is supported with a proposed metric for CAD sequence, the mean Average Precision of CAD Sequence, that addresses the limitations of existing metrics.</description>

      <title>SlimFlow: Training Smaller One-Step Diffusion Models with Rectified Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel in high-quality generation but suffer from slow inference due to iterative sampling. While recent methods have successfully transformed diffusion models into one-step generators, they neglect model size reduction, limiting their applicability in compute-constrained scenarios. This paper aims to develop small, efficient one-step diffusion models based on the powerful rectified flow framework, by exploring joint compression of inference steps and model size. The rectified flow framework trains one-step generative models using two operations, reflow and distillation. Compared with the original framework, squeezing the model size brings two new challenges: (1) the initialization mismatch between large teachers and small students during reflow; (2) the underperformance of naive distillation on small student models. To overcome these issues, we propose Annealing Reflow and Flow-Guided Distillation, which together comprise our SlimFlow framework. With our novel framework, we train a one-step diffusion model with an FID of 5.02 and 15.7M parameters, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art one-step diffusion model (FID=6.47, 19.4M parameters) on CIFAR10. On ImageNet 64$\times$64 and FFHQ 64$\times$64, our method yields small one-step diffusion models that are comparable to larger models, showcasing the effectiveness of our method in creating compact, efficient one-step diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Bi-Regressor Network for Domain Adaptive Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer the knowledge of a well-labeled source domain to facilitate unlabeled target learning. When turning to specific tasks such as indoor (Wi-Fi) localization, it is essential to learn a cross-domain regressor to mitigate the domain shift. This paper proposes a novel method Adversarial Bi-Regressor Network (ABRNet) to seek more effective cross-domain regression model. Specifically, a discrepant bi-regressor architecture is developed to maximize the difference of bi-regressor to discover uncertain target instances far from the source distribution, and then an adversarial training mechanism is adopted between feature extractor and dual regressors to produce domain-invariant representations. To further bridge the large domain gap, a domain-specific augmentation module is designed to synthesize two source-similar and target-similar intermediate domains to gradually eliminate the original domain mismatch. The empirical studies on two cross-domain regressive benchmarks illustrate the power of our method on solving the domain adaptive regression (DAR) problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient Image Denoising by Low-Rank Singular Vector Approximations of Geodesics' Gramian Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of sophisticated cameras, the urge to capture high-quality images has grown enormous. However, the noise contamination of the images results in substandard expectations among the people; thus, image denoising is an essential pre-processing step. While the algebraic image processing frameworks are sometimes inefficient for this denoising task as they may require processing of matrices of order equivalent to some power of the order of the original image, the neural network image processing frameworks are sometimes not robust as they require a lot of similar training samples. Thus, here we present a manifold-based noise filtering method that mainly exploits a few prominent singular vectors of the geodesics' Gramian matrix. Especially, the framework partitions an image, say that of size $n \times n$, into $n^2$ overlapping patches of known size such that one patch is centered at each pixel. Then, the prominent singular vectors, of the Gramian matrix of size $n^2 \times n^2$ of the geodesic distances computed over the patch space, are utilized to denoise the image. Here, the prominent singular vectors are revealed by efficient, but diverse, approximation techniques, rather than explicitly computing them using frameworks like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which encounters $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ operations. Finally, we compare both computational time and the noise filtration performance of the proposed denoising algorithm with and without singular vector approximation techniques.</description>

      <title>Sparse-IFT: Sparse Iso-FLOP Transformations for Maximizing Training Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11525v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has focused on weight sparsity in deep neural network training to reduce FLOPs, aiming for improved efficiency (test accuracy w.r.t training FLOPs). However, sparse weight training often compromises accuracy, requiring extended training schedules to attain the accuracy of dense models. In contrast, our approach, Sparse Iso-FLOP Transformations (Sparse-IFT), uses sparsity to improve accuracy while maintaining dense model FLOPs. Using a single hyperparameter (i.e., the sparsity level), Sparse-IFTs efficiently replace dense layers, expanding the search space for optimal sparse masks. In addition, dynamic sparse training (DST) with Sparse-IFT models effectively navigate this larger sparse mask-weight space, which is evidenced by a spectral analysis using Ramanujan graph properties. Our study reveals a robust correlation among mask topology, weights, and final performance. Notably, without adjusting any training hyperparameters, replacing dense layers with Sparse-IFT yields significant improvements, such as a +3.5% boost for ResNet-18 on ImageNet and +0.9% for GPT-3 Small on the Open LLM leaderboard. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the use of sparsity for improving the accuracy of dense models through a set of simple-to-use sparse transformations.

Abstract: 3D shape generation techniques leveraging deep learning have garnered significant interest from both the computer vision and architectural design communities, promising to enrich the content in the virtual environment. However, research on virtual architectural design remains limited, particularly regarding designer-AI collaboration and deep learning-assisted design. In our survey, we reviewed 149 related articles (81.2% of articles published between 2019 and 2023) covering architectural design, 3D shape techniques, and virtual environments. Through scrutinizing the literature, we first identify the principles of virtual architecture and illuminate its current production challenges, including datasets, multimodality, design intuition, and generative frameworks. We then introduce the latest approaches to designing and generating virtual buildings leveraging 3D shape generation and summarize four characteristics of various approaches to virtual architecture. Based on our analysis, we expound on four research agendas, including agency, communication, user consideration, and integrating tools. Additionally, we highlight four important enablers of ubiquitous interaction with immersive systems in deep learning-assisted architectural generation. Our work contributes to fostering understanding between designers and deep learning techniques, broadening access to designer-AI collaboration. We advocate for interdisciplinary efforts to address this timely research topic, facilitating content designing and generation in the virtual environment.</description>

Abstract: The work proposes a novel deep-learning framework for the synthesis of three-dimensional MRI volumes from corresponding 3D ultrasound images of the brain, leveraging a modified iteration of the Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. Addressing the formidable challenge of bridging the modality disparity between ultrasound and MRI, this research holds promise for transformative applications in medical diagnostics and treatment planning within the neuroimaging domain. While the findings reveal a discernible degree of similarity between the synthesized MRI volumes and anticipated outcomes, they fall short of practical deployment standards, primarily due to constraints associated with dataset scale and computational resources. The methodology yields MRI volumes with a satisfactory similarity score, establishing a foundational benchmark for subsequent investigations.</description>

      <title>Heteroscedastic Uncertainty Estimation Framework for Unsupervised Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for unsupervised registration often rely on objectives that assume a uniform noise level across the spatial domain (e.g. mean-squared error loss), but noise distributions are often heteroscedastic and input-dependent in real-world medical images. Thus, this assumption often leads to degradation in registration performance, mainly due to the undesired influence of noise-induced outliers. To mitigate this, we propose a framework for heteroscedastic image uncertainty estimation that can adaptively reduce the influence of regions with high uncertainty during unsupervised registration. The framework consists of a collaborative training strategy for the displacement and variance estimators, and a novel image fidelity weighting scheme utilizing signal-to-noise ratios. Our approach prevents the model from being driven away by spurious gradients caused by the simplified homoscedastic assumption, leading to more accurate displacement estimation. To illustrate its versatility and effectiveness, we tested our framework on two representative registration architectures across three medical image datasets. Our method consistently outperforms baselines and produces sensible uncertainty estimates. The code is publicly available at \url{https://voldemort108x.github.io/hetero_uncertainty/}.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Correspondence Scoring for Unsupervised Medical Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive training scheme for unsupervised medical image registration. Existing methods rely on image reconstruction as the primary supervision signal. However, nuisance variables (e.g. noise and covisibility), violation of the Lambertian assumption in physical waves (e.g. ultrasound), and inconsistent image acquisition can all cause a loss of correspondence between medical images. As the unsupervised learning scheme relies on intensity constancy between images to establish correspondence for reconstruction, this introduces spurious error residuals that are not modeled by the typical training objective. To mitigate this, we propose an adaptive framework that re-weights the error residuals with a correspondence scoring map during training, preventing the parametric displacement estimator from drifting away due to noisy gradients, which leads to performance degradation. To illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of our method, we tested our framework on three representative registration architectures across three medical image datasets along with other baselines. Our adaptive framework consistently outperforms other methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Paired t-tests show that our improvements are statistically significant.

      <title>Efficient Training for Multilingual Visual Speech Recognition: Pre-training with Discretized Visual Speech Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores sentence-level multilingual Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) that can recognize different languages with a single trained model. As the massive multilingual modeling of visual data requires huge computational costs, we propose a novel training strategy, processing with visual speech units. Motivated by the recent success of the audio speech unit, we propose to use a visual speech unit that can be obtained by discretizing the visual speech features extracted from the self-supervised visual speech model. Through analysis, we verify that the visual speech units mainly contain viseme information while suppressing non-linguistic information. By using the visual speech units as the inputs of our system, we propose to pre-train a VSR model to predict corresponding text outputs on multilingual data constructed by merging several VSR databases. As both the inputs (i.e., visual speech units) and outputs (i.e., text) are discrete, we can greatly improve the training efficiency compared to the standard VSR training. Specifically, the input data size is reduced to 0.016% of the original video inputs. In order to complement the insufficient visual information in speech recognition, we apply curriculum learning where the inputs of the system begin with audio-visual speech units and gradually change to visual speech units. After pre-training, the model is finetuned on continuous features. We set new state-of-the-art multilingual VSR performances by achieving comparable performances to the previous language-specific VSR models, with a single trained model.</description>

Abstract: There is a sensory gulf between the Earth that humans inhabit and the digital realms in which modern AI agents are created. To develop AI agents that can sense, think, and act as flexibly as humans in real-world settings, it is imperative to bridge the realism gap between the digital and physical worlds. How can we embody agents in an environment as rich and diverse as the one we inhabit, without the constraints imposed by real hardware and control? Towards this end, we introduce V-IRL: a platform that enables agents to scalably interact with the real world in a virtual yet realistic environment. Our platform serves as a playground for developing agents that can accomplish various practical tasks and as a vast testbed for measuring progress in capabilities spanning perception, decision-making, and interaction with real-world data across the entire globe.</description>

Abstract: Performing language-conditioned robotic manipulation tasks in unstructured environments is highly demanded for general intelligent robots. Conventional robotic manipulation methods usually learn semantic representation of the observation for action prediction, which ignores the scene-level spatiotemporal dynamics for human goal completion. In this paper, we propose a dynamic Gaussian Splatting method named ManiGaussian for multi-task robotic manipulation, which mines scene dynamics via future scene reconstruction. Specifically, we first formulate the dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that infers the semantics propagation in the Gaussian embedding space, where the semantic representation is leveraged to predict the optimal robot action. Then, we build a Gaussian world model to parameterize the distribution in our dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework, which provides informative supervision in the interactive environment via future scene reconstruction. We evaluate our ManiGaussian on 10 RLBench tasks with 166 variations, and the results demonstrate our framework can outperform the state-of-the-art methods by 13.1\% in average success rate.

      <title>Transformers Get Stable: An End-to-End Signal Propagation Theory for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of their huge success, transformer models remain difficult to scale in depth. In this work, we develop a unified signal propagation theory and provide formulae that govern the moments of the forward and backward signal through the transformer model. Our framework can be used to understand and mitigate vanishing/exploding gradients, rank collapse, and instability associated with high attention scores. We also propose DeepScaleLM, an initialization and scaling scheme that conserves unit output/gradient moments throughout the model, enabling the training of very deep models with 1000 layers. We find that transformer models could be much deeper - our deep models with fewer parameters outperform shallow models in Language Modeling, Speech Translation, and Image Classification, across encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder variants, for both Pre-LN and Post-LN transformers, for multiple datasets and model sizes. These improvements also translate into improved performance on downstream Question Answering tasks and improved robustness for Image Classification.</description>

      <title>Not Just Change the Labels, Learn the Features: Watermarking Deep Neural Networks with Multi-View Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms, there is a growing focus on deep neural network (DNN) watermarking techniques. These methods are used to facilitate the verification of ownership for a target DNN model to protect intellectual property. One of the most widely employed watermarking techniques involves embedding a trigger set into the source model. Unfortunately, existing methodologies based on trigger sets are still susceptible to functionality-stealing attacks, potentially enabling adversaries to steal the functionality of the source model without a reliable means of verifying ownership. In this paper, we first introduce a novel perspective on trigger set-based watermarking methods from a feature learning perspective. Specifically, we demonstrate that by selecting data exhibiting multiple features, also referred to as \emph{multi-view data}, it becomes feasible to effectively defend functionality stealing attacks. Based on this perspective, we introduce a novel watermarking technique based on Multi-view dATa, called MAT, for efficiently embedding watermarks within DNNs. This approach involves constructing a trigger set with multi-view data and incorporating a simple feature-based regularization method for training the source model. We validate our method across various benchmarks and demonstrate its efficacy in defending against model extraction attacks, surpassing relevant baselines by a significant margin.

      <title>A Survey of Artificial Intelligence in Gait-Based Neurodegenerative Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Meanwhile, a novel quality evaluation criterion is proposed to quantitatively assess the quality of existing studies. Through an extensive review and analysis of 164 studies, we identify and discuss the challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis. We provide a public resource repository to track and facilitate developments in this emerging field: https://github.com/Kali-Hac/AI4NDD-Survey.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enhance the capabilities of standard large language models by integrating and processing data from multiple modalities, including text, vision, audio, video, and 3D environments. Data plays a pivotal role in the development and refinement of these models. In this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on MLLMs from a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we explore methods for preparing multimodal data during the pretraining and adaptation phases of MLLMs. Additionally, we analyze the evaluation methods for the datasets and review the benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs. Our survey also outlines potential future research directions. This work aims to provide researchers with a detailed understanding of the data-driven aspects of MLLMs, fostering further exploration and innovation in this field.</description>

      <title>An Intrinsic Vector Heat Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09648</link>

Abstract: Vector fields are widely used to represent and model flows for many science and engineering applications. This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture for learning tangent vector fields that are intrinsically defined on manifold surfaces embedded in 3D. Previous approaches to learning vector fields on surfaces treat vectors as multi-dimensional scalar fields, using traditional scalar-valued architectures to process channels individually, thus fail to preserve fundamental intrinsic properties of the vector field. The core idea of this work is to introduce a trainable vector heat diffusion module to spatially propagate vector-valued feature data across the surface, which we incorporate into our proposed architecture that consists of vector-valued neurons. Our architecture is invariant to rigid motion of the input, isometric deformation, and choice of local tangent bases, and is robust to discretizations of the surface. We evaluate our Vector Heat Network on triangle meshes, and empirically validate its invariant properties. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the useful industrial application of quadrilateral mesh generation.</description>

      <title>Explicit-NeRF-QA: A Quality Assessment Database for Explicit NeRF Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated significant advantages in representing and synthesizing 3D scenes. Explicit NeRF models facilitate the practical NeRF applications with faster rendering speed, and also attract considerable attention in NeRF compression due to its huge storage cost. To address the challenge of the NeRF compression study, in this paper, we construct a new dataset, called Explicit-NeRF-QA. We use 22 3D objects with diverse geometries, textures, and material complexities to train four typical explicit NeRF models across five parameter levels. Lossy compression is introduced during the model generation, pivoting the selection of key parameters such as hash table size for InstantNGP and voxel grid resolution for Plenoxels. By rendering NeRF samples to processed video sequences (PVS), a large scale subjective experiment with lab environment is conducted to collect subjective scores from 21 viewers. The diversity of content, accuracy of mean opinion scores (MOS), and characteristics of NeRF distortion are comprehensively presented, establishing the heterogeneity of the proposed dataset. The state-of-the-art objective metrics are tested in the new dataset. Best Person correlation, which is around 0.85, is collected from the full-reference objective metric. All tested no-reference metrics report very poor results with 0.4 to 0.6 correlations, demonstrating the need for further development of more robust no-reference metrics. The dataset, including NeRF samples, source 3D objects, multiview images for NeRF generation, PVSs, MOS, is made publicly available at the following location: https://github.com/LittlericeChloe/Explicit_NeRF_QA.</description>
