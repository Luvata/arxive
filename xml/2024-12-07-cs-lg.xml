      <title>Reinforced Symbolic Learning with Logical Constraints for Predicting Turbine Blade Fatigue Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of turbine blade fatigue life is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of aircraft engines. A significant challenge in this domain is uncovering the intrinsic relationship between mechanical properties and fatigue life. This paper introduces Reinforced Symbolic Learning (RSL), a method that derives predictive formulas linking these properties to fatigue life. RSL incorporates logical constraints during symbolic optimization, ensuring that the generated formulas are both physically meaningful and interpretable. The optimization process is further enhanced using deep reinforcement learning, which efficiently guides the symbolic regression towards more accurate models. The proposed RSL method was evaluated on two turbine blade materials, GH4169 and TC4, to identify optimal fatigue life prediction models. When compared with six empirical formulas and five machine learning algorithms, RSL not only produces more interpretable formulas but also achieves superior or comparable predictive accuracy. Additionally, finite element simulations were conducted to assess mechanical properties at critical points on the blade, which were then used to predict fatigue life under various operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Online Physics-Informed Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) has received increasing research attention due to its capability to analyze and model complex dynamical systems. However, it faces challenges in computational efficiency, noise sensitivity, and difficulty adhering to physical laws, which negatively affect its performance. Addressing these issues, we present Online Physics-informed DMD (OPIDMD), a novel adaptation of DMD into a convex optimization framework. This approach not only ensures convergence to a unique global optimum, but also enhances the efficiency and accuracy of modeling dynamical systems in an online setting. Leveraging the Bayesian DMD framework, we propose a probabilistic interpretation of Physics-informed DMD (piDMD), examining the impact of physical constraints on the DMD linear operator. Further, we implement online proximal gradient descent and formulate specific algorithms to tackle problems with different physical constraints, enabling real-time solutions across various scenarios. Compared with existing algorithms such as Exact DMD, Online DMD, and piDMD, OPIDMD achieves the best prediction performance in short-term forecasting, e.g. an $R^2$ value of 0.991 for noisy Lorenz system. The proposed method employs a time-varying linear operator, offering a promising solution for the real-time simulation and control of complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Sketches for Frequency Estimation in Data Streams without Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the frequency of items on the high-volume, fast data stream has been extensively studied in many areas, such as database and network measurement. Traditional sketch algorithms only allow to give very rough estimates with limited memory cost, whereas some learning-augmented algorithms have been proposed recently, their offline framework requires actual frequencies that are challenging to access in general for training, and speed is too slow for real-time processing, despite the still coarse-grained accuracy.
  To this end, we propose a more practical learning-based estimation framework namely UCL-sketch, by following the line of equation-based sketch to estimate per-key frequencies. In a nutshell, there are two key techniques: online training via equivalent learning without ground truth, and highly scalable architecture with logical estimation buckets. We implemented experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The results demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms existing state-of-the-art sketches regarding per-key accuracy and distribution, while preserving resource efficiency. Our code is attached in the supplementary material, and will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/UCL-sketch.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Tuning Through Pessimistic Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated hyperparameter search in machine learning, especially for deep learning models, is typically formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, with hyperparameter values determined by the upper level and the model learning achieved by the lower-level problem. Most of the existing bilevel optimization solutions either assume the uniqueness of the optimal training model given hyperparameters or adopt an optimistic view when the non-uniqueness issue emerges. Potential model uncertainty may arise when training complex models with limited data, especially when the uniqueness assumption is violated. Thus, the suitability of the optimistic view underlying current bilevel hyperparameter optimization solutions is questionable. In this paper, we propose pessimistic bilevel hyperparameter optimization to assure appropriate outer-level hyperparameters to better generalize the inner-level learned models, by explicitly incorporating potential uncertainty of the inner-level solution set. To solve the resulting computationally challenging pessimistic bilevel optimization problem, we develop a novel relaxation-based approximation method. It derives pessimistic solutions with more robust prediction models. In our empirical studies of automated hyperparameter search for binary linear classifiers, pessimistic solutions have demonstrated better prediction performances than optimistic counterparts when we have limited training data or perturbed testing data, showing the necessity of considering pessimistic solutions besides existing optimistic ones.</description>

      <title>Tight Lower Bounds and Improved Convergence in Performative Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performative prediction is a framework accounting for the shift in the data distribution induced by the prediction of a model deployed in the real world. Ensuring rapid convergence to a stable solution where the data distribution remains the same after the model deployment is crucial, especially in evolving environments. This paper extends the Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM) framework by utilizing historical datasets from previous retraining snapshots, yielding a class of algorithms that we call Affine Risk Minimizers and enabling convergence to a performatively stable point for a broader class of problems. We introduce a new upper bound for methods that use only the final iteration of the dataset and prove for the first time the tightness of both this new bound and the previous existing bounds within the same regime. We also prove that utilizing historical datasets can surpass the lower bound for last iterate RRM, and empirically observe faster convergence to the stable point on various performative prediction benchmarks. We offer at the same time the first lower bound analysis for RRM within the class of Affine Risk Minimizers, quantifying the potential improvements in convergence speed that could be achieved with other variants in our framework.</description>

      <title>Designing DNNs for a trade-off between robustness and processing performance in embedded devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning-based embedded systems employed in safety-critical applications such as aerospace and autonomous driving need to be robust against perturbations produced by soft errors. Soft errors are an increasing concern in modern digital processors since smaller transistor geometries and lower voltages give electronic devices a higher sensitivity to background radiation. The resilience of deep neural network (DNN) models to perturbations in their parameters is determined, to a large extent, by the structure of the model itself, and also by the selected numerical representation and used arithmetic precision. When compression techniques such as model pruning and model quantization are applied to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity for deployment, both model structure and numerical representation are modified and thus, soft error robustness also changes. In this sense, although the choice of activation functions (AFs) in DNN models is frequently ignored, it conditions not only their accuracy and trainability, but also compressibility rates and numerical robustness. This paper investigates the suitability of using bounded AFs to improve model robustness against DNN parameter perturbations, assessing at the same time the impact of this choice on deployment in terms of model accuracy, compressibility, and computational burden. In particular, we analyze encoder-decoder fully convolutional models aimed at performing semantic segmentation tasks on hyperspectral images for scene understanding in autonomous driving. Deployment characterization is performed experimentally on an AMD-Xilinx's KV260 SoM.</description>

      <title>Predicting Pedestrian Crossing Behavior in Germany and Japan: Insights into Model Transferability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting pedestrian crossing behavior is important for intelligent traffic systems to avoid pedestrian-vehicle collisions. Most existing pedestrian crossing behavior models are trained and evaluated on datasets collected from a single country, overlooking differences between countries. To address this gap, we compared pedestrian road-crossing behavior at unsignalized crossings in Germany and Japan. We presented four types of machine learning models to predict gap selection behavior, zebra crossing usage, and their trajectories using simulator data collected from both countries. When comparing the differences between countries, pedestrians from the study conducted in Japan are more cautious, selecting larger gaps compared to those in Germany. We evaluate and analyze model transferability. Our results show that neural networks outperform other machine learning models in predicting gap selection and zebra crossing usage, while random forest models perform best on trajectory prediction tasks, demonstrating strong performance and transferability. We develop a transferable model using an unsupervised clustering method, which improves prediction accuracy for gap selection and trajectory prediction. These findings provide a deeper understanding of pedestrian crossing behaviors in different countries and offer valuable insights into model transferability.</description>

      <title>Good practices for evaluation of machine learning systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many development decisions affect the results obtained from ML experiments: training data, features, model architecture, hyperparameters, test data, etc. Among these aspects, arguably the most important design decisions are those that involve the evaluation procedure. This procedure is what determines whether the conclusions drawn from the experiments will or will not generalize to unseen data and whether they will be relevant to the application of interest. If the data is incorrectly selected, the wrong metric is chosen for evaluation or the significance of the comparisons between models is overestimated, conclusions may be misleading or result in suboptimal development decisions. To avoid such problems, the evaluation protocol should be very carefully designed before experimentation starts.
  In this work we discuss the main aspects involved in the design of the evaluation protocol: data selection, metric selection, and statistical significance. This document is not meant to be an exhaustive tutorial on each of these aspects. Instead, the goal is to explain the main guidelines that should be followed in each case. We include examples taken from the speech processing field, and provide a list of common mistakes related to each aspect.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Hierarchical Attention Network for Medical Condition Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of medical conditions with straight past clinical evidence is a long-sought topic in the medical management and health insurance field. Although great progress has been made with machine learning algorithms, the medical community is still skeptical about the model accuracy and interpretability. This paper presents an innovative hierarchical attention deep learning model to achieve better prediction and clear interpretability that can be easily understood by medical professionals.
  This paper developed an Interpretable Hierarchical Attention Network (IHAN). IHAN uses a hierarchical attention structure that matches naturally with the medical history data structure and reflects patients encounter (date of service) sequence. The model attention structure consists of 3 levels: (1) attention on the medical code types (diagnosis codes, procedure codes, lab test results, and prescription drugs), (2) attention on the sequential medical encounters within a type, (3) attention on the individual medical codes within an encounter and type.
  This model is applied to predict the occurrence of stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), using three years medical history of Medicare Advantage (MA) members from an American nationwide health insurance company. The model takes members medical events, both claims and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data, as input, makes a prediction of stage 3 CKD and calculates contribution from individual events to the predicted outcome.</description>

      <title>Fairness without Demographics through Learning Graph of Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning systems are notoriously prone to biased predictions about certain demographic groups, leading to algorithmic fairness issues. Due to privacy concerns and data quality problems, some demographic information may not be available in the training data and the complex interaction of different demographics can lead to a lot of unknown minority subpopulations, which all limit the applicability of group fairness. Many existing works on fairness without demographics assume the correlation between groups and features. However, we argue that the model gradients are also valuable for fairness without demographics. In this paper, we show that the correlation between gradients and groups can help identify and improve group fairness. With an adversarial weighting architecture, we construct a graph where samples with similar gradients are connected and learn the weights of different samples from it. Unlike the surrogate grouping methods that cluster groups from features and labels as proxy sensitive attribute, our method leverages the graph structure as a soft grouping mechanism, which is much more robust to noises. The results show that our method is robust to noise and can improve fairness significantly without decreasing the overall accuracy too much.</description>

      <title>PathletRL++: Optimizing Trajectory Pathlet Extraction and Dictionary Formation via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in tracking technologies have spurred the rapid growth of large-scale trajectory data. Building a compact collection of pathlets, referred to as a trajectory pathlet dictionary, is essential for supporting mobility-related applications. Existing methods typically adopt a top-down approach, generating numerous candidate pathlets and selecting a subset, leading to high memory usage and redundant storage from overlapping pathlets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a bottom-up strategy that incrementally merges basic pathlets to build the dictionary, reducing memory requirements by up to 24,000 times compared to baseline methods. The approach begins with unit-length pathlets and iteratively merges them while optimizing utility, which is defined using newly introduced metrics of trajectory loss and representability. We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework, PathletRL, which utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to approximate the utility function, resulting in a compact and efficient pathlet dictionary. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the size of the constructed dictionary by up to 65.8%. Additionally, our results show that only half of the dictionary pathlets are needed to reconstruct 85% of the original trajectory data. Building on PathletRL, we introduce PathletRL++, which extends the original model by incorporating a richer state representation and an improved reward function to optimize decision-making during pathlet merging. These enhancements enable the agent to gain a more nuanced understanding of the environment, leading to higher-quality pathlet dictionaries. PathletRL++ achieves even greater dictionary size reduction, surpassing the performance of PathletRL, while maintaining high trajectory representability.</description>

      <title>A Water Efficiency Dataset for African Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI computing and data centers consume a large amount of freshwater, both directly for cooling and indirectly for electricity generation. While most attention has been paid to developed countries such as the U.S., this paper presents the first-of-its-kind dataset that combines nation-level weather and electricity generation data to estimate water usage efficiency for data centers in 41 African countries across five different climate regions. We also use our dataset to evaluate and estimate the water consumption of inference on two large language models (i.e., Llama-3-70B and GPT-4) in 11 selected African countries. Our findings show that writing a 10-page report using Llama-3-70B could consume about \textbf{0.7 liters} of water, while the water consumption by GPT-4 for the same task may go up to about 60 liters. For writing a medium-length email of 120-200 words, Llama-3-70B and GPT-4 could consume about \textbf{0.13 liters} and 3 liters of water, respectively. Interestingly, given the same AI model, 8 out of the 11 selected African countries consume less water than the global average, mainly because of lower water intensities for electricity generation. However, water consumption can be substantially higher in some African countries with a steppe climate than the U.S. and global averages, prompting more attention when deploying AI computing in these countries. Our dataset is publicly available on \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/masterlion/WaterEfficientDatasetForAfricanCountries/tree/main}{Hugging Face}.</description>

      <title>Electrocardiogram-based diagnosis of liver diseases: an externally validated and explainable machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Liver diseases are a major global health concern, often diagnosed using resource-intensive methods. Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, widely accessible and non-invasive, offers potential as a diagnostic tool for liver diseases, leveraging the physiological connections between cardiovascular and hepatic health.
  Methods: This study applies machine learning models to ECG data for the diagnosis of liver diseases. The pipeline, combining tree-based models with Shapley values for explainability, was trained, internally validated, and externally validated on an independent cohort, demonstrating robust generalizability.
  Findings: Our results demonstrate the potential of ECG to derive biomarkers to diagnose liver diseases. Shapley values revealed key ECG features contributing to model predictions, highlighting already known connections between cardiovascular biomarkers and hepatic conditions as well as providing new ones. Furthermore, our approach holds promise as a scalable and affordable solution for liver disease detection, particularly in resource-limited settings.
  Interpretation: This study underscores the feasibility of leveraging ECG features and machine learning to enhance the diagnosis of liver diseases. By providing interpretable insights into cardiovascular-liver interactions, the approach bridges existing gaps in non-invasive diagnostics, offering implications for broader systemic disease monitoring.</description>

      <title>Online Experimental Design With Estimation-Regret Trade-off Under Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network interference has garnered significant interest in the field of causal inference. It reflects diverse sociological behaviors, wherein the treatment assigned to one individual within a network may influence the outcome of other individuals, such as their neighbors. To estimate the causal effect, one classical way is to randomly assign experimental candidates into different groups and compare their differences. However, in the context of sequential experiments, such treatment assignment may result in a large regret. In this paper, we develop a unified interference-based online experimental design framework. Compared to existing literature, we expand the definition of arm space by leveraging the statistical concept of exposure mapping. Importantly, we establish the Pareto-optimal trade-off between the estimation accuracy and regret with respect to both time period and arm space, which remains superior to the baseline even in the absence of network interference. We further propose an algorithmic implementation and model generalization.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Machine Learning Models to Predict Acute Kidney Injury in Septic Patients from MIMIC-III Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis is a severe condition that causes the body to respond incorrectly to an infection. This reaction can subsequently cause organ failure, a major one being acute kidney injury (AKI). For septic patients, approximately 50% develop AKI, with a mortality rate above 40%. Creating models that can accurately predict AKI based on specific qualities of septic patients is crucial for early detection and intervention. Using medical data from septic patients during intensive care unit (ICU) admission from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care 3 (MIMIC-III) database, we extracted 3301 patients with sepsis, with 73% of patients developing AKI. The data was randomly divided into a training set (n = 1980, 40%), a test set (n = 661, 10%), and a validation set (n = 660, 50%). The proposed model was logistic regression, and it was compared against five baseline models: XGBoost, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and LightGBM. Area Under the Curve (AUC), Accuracy, F1-Score, and Recall were calculated for each model. After analysis, we were able to select 23 features to include in our model, the top features being urine output, maximum bilirubin, minimum bilirubin, weight, maximum blood urea nitrogen, and minimum estimated glomerular filtration rate. The logistic regression model performed the best, achieving an AUC score of 0.887 (95% CI: [0.861-0.915]), an accuracy of 0.817, an F1 score of 0.866, a recall score of 0.827, and a Brier score of 0.13. Compared to the best existing literature in this field, our model achieved an 8.57% improvement in AUC while using 13 fewer variables, showcasing its effectiveness in determining AKI in septic patients. While the features selected for predicting AKI in septic patients are similar to previous literature, the top features that influenced our model's performance differ.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Deep-Learning Model for El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation in the Low-Data Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep-learning models have demonstrated skillful El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts up to one year in advance, they are predominantly trained on climate model simulations that provide thousands of years of training data at the expense of introducing climate model biases. Simpler Linear Inverse Models (LIMs) trained on the much shorter observational record also make skillful ENSO predictions but do not capture predictable nonlinear processes. This motivates a hybrid approach, combining the LIMs modest data needs with a deep-learning non-Markovian correction of the LIM. For O(100 yr) datasets, our resulting Hybrid model is more skillful than the LIM while also exceeding the skill of a full deep-learning model. Additionally, while the most predictable ENSO events are still identified in advance by the LIM, they are better predicted by the Hybrid model, especially in the western tropical Pacific for leads beyond about 9 months, by capturing the subsequent asymmetric (warm versus cold phases) evolution of ENSO.</description>

      <title>Hyper: Hyperparameter Robust Efficient Exploration in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration \&amp; exploitation dilemma poses significant challenges in reinforcement learning (RL). Recently, curiosity-based exploration methods achieved great success in tackling hard-exploration problems. However, they necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning on different environments, which heavily limits the applicability and accessibility of this line of methods. In this paper, we characterize this problem via analysis of the agent behavior, concluding the fundamental difficulty of choosing a proper hyperparameter. We then identify the difficulty and the instability of the optimization when the agent learns with curiosity. We propose our method, hyperparameter robust exploration (\textbf{Hyper}), which extensively mitigates the problem by effectively regularizing the visitation of the exploration and decoupling the exploitation to ensure stable training. We theoretically justify that \textbf{Hyper} is provably efficient under function approximation setting and empirically demonstrate its appealing performance and robustness in various environments.</description>

      <title>Modular addition without black-boxes: Compressing explanations of MLPs that compute numerical integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of mechanistic interpretability is discovering simpler, low-rank algorithms implemented by models. While we can compress activations into features, compressing nonlinear feature-maps -- like MLP layers -- is an open problem. In this work, we present the first case study in rigorously compressing nonlinear feature-maps, which are the leading asymptotic bottleneck to compressing small transformer models. We work in the classic setting of the modular addition models, and target a non-vacuous bound on the behaviour of the ReLU MLP in time linear in the parameter-count of the circuit. To study the ReLU MLP analytically, we use the infinite-width lens, which turns post-activation matrix multiplications into approximate integrals. We discover a novel interpretation of} the MLP layer in one-layer transformers implementing the ``pizza'' algorithm: the MLP can be understood as evaluating a quadrature scheme, where each neuron computes the area of a rectangle under the curve of a trigonometric integral identity. Our code is available at https://tinyurl.com/mod-add-integration.</description>

      <title>Expressivity of Representation Learning on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs: An Information-Flow Centric Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, ranging from social networks to biological systems, and have inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for learning expressive representations. While most research has centered on static graphs, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic, temporally evolving graphs, motivating the need for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on CTDGs with a focus on Self-Supervised Representation Learning (SSRL). We introduce a novel theoretical framework that analyzes the expressivity of CTDG models through an Information-Flow (IF) lens, quantifying their ability to propagate and encode temporal and structural information. Leveraging this framework, we categorize existing CTDG methods based on their suitability for different graph types and application scenarios. Within the same scope, we examine the design of SSRL methods tailored to CTDGs, such as predictive and contrastive approaches, highlighting their potential to mitigate the reliance on labeled data. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of various methods across long-range, bi-partite and community-based graphs. This work offers both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for selecting and developing CTDG models, advancing the understanding of GRL in dynamic settings.</description>

      <title>Coordinate In and Value Out: Training Flow Transformers in Ambient Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching models have emerged as a powerful method for generative modeling on domains like images or videos, and even on unstructured data like 3D point clouds. These models are commonly trained in two stages: first, a data compressor (i.e., a variational auto-encoder) is trained, and in a subsequent training stage a flow matching generative model is trained in the low-dimensional latent space of the data compressor. This two stage paradigm adds complexity to the overall training recipe and sets obstacles for unifying models across data domains, as specific data compressors are used for different data modalities. To this end, we introduce Ambient Space Flow Transformers (ASFT), a domain-agnostic approach to learn flow matching transformers in ambient space, sidestepping the requirement of training compressors and simplifying the training process. We introduce a conditionally independent point-wise training objective that enables ASFT to make predictions continuously in coordinate space. Our empirical results demonstrate that using general purpose transformer blocks, ASFT effectively handles different data modalities such as images and 3D point clouds, achieving strong performance in both domains and outperforming comparable approaches. ASFT is a promising step towards domain-agnostic flow matching generative models that can be trivially adopted in different data domains.</description>

      <title>ELEMENT: Episodic and Lifelong Exploration via Maximum Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes \emph{Episodic and Lifelong Exploration via Maximum ENTropy} (ELEMENT), a novel, multiscale, intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning (RL) framework that is able to explore environments without using any extrinsic reward and transfer effectively the learned skills to downstream tasks. We advance the state of the art in three ways. First, we propose a multiscale entropy optimization to take care of the fact that previous maximum state entropy, for lifelong exploration with millions of state observations, suffers from vanishing rewards and becomes very expensive computationally across iterations. Therefore, we add an episodic maximum entropy over each episode to speedup the search further. Second, we propose a novel intrinsic reward for episodic entropy maximization named \emph{average episodic state entropy} which provides the optimal solution for a theoretical upper bound of the episodic state entropy objective. Third, to speed the lifelong entropy maximization, we propose a $k$ nearest neighbors ($k$NN) graph to organize the estimation of the entropy and updating processes that reduces the computation substantially. Our ELEMENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art intrinsic rewards in both episodic and lifelong setups. Moreover, it can be exploited in task-agnostic pre-training, collecting data for offline reinforcement learning, etc.</description>

      <title>Residual Hyperbolic Graph Convolution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (HGCNs) have demonstrated representational capabilities of modeling hierarchical-structured graphs. However, as in general GCNs, over-smoothing may occur as the number of model layers increases, limiting the representation capabilities of most current HGCN models. In this paper, we propose residual hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (R-HGCNs) to address the over-smoothing problem. We introduce a hyperbolic residual connection function to overcome the over-smoothing problem, and also theoretically prove the effectiveness of the hyperbolic residual function. Moreover, we use product manifolds and HyperDrop to facilitate the R-HGCNs. The distinctive features of the R-HGCNs are as follows: (1) The hyperbolic residual connection preserves the initial node information in each layer and adds a hyperbolic identity mapping to prevent node features from being indistinguishable. (2) Product manifolds in R-HGCNs have been set up with different origin points in different components to facilitate the extraction of feature information from a wider range of perspectives, which enhances the representing capability of R-HGCNs. (3) HyperDrop adds multiplicative Gaussian noise into hyperbolic representations, such that perturbations can be added to alleviate the over-fitting problem without deconstructing the hyperbolic geometry. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of R-HGCNs under various graph convolution layers and different structures of product manifolds.</description>

      <title>A large language model-type architecture for high-dimensional molecular potential energy surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing high dimensional potential surfaces for molecular and materials systems is considered to be a great challenge in computational chemistry with potential impact in a range of areas including fundamental prediction of reaction rates. In this paper we design and discuss an algorithm that has similarities to large language models in generative AI and natural language processing. Specifically, we represent a molecular system as a graph which contains a set of nodes, edges, faces etc. Interactions between these sets, which represent molecular subsystems in our case, are used to construct the potential energy surface for a reasonably sized chemical system with 51 dimensions. Essentially a family of neural networks that pertain to the graph-based subsystems, get the job done for this 51 dimensional system. We then ask if this same family of lower-dimensional neural networks can be transformed to provide accurate predictions for a 186 dimensional potential surface. We find that our algorithm does provide reasonably accurate results for this larger dimensional problem with sub-kcal/mol accuracy for the higher dimensional potential surface problem.</description>

      <title>What Do Machine Learning Researchers Mean by "Reproducible"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concern that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are entering a "reproducibility crisis" has spurred significant research in the past few years. Yet with each paper, it is often unclear what someone means by "reproducibility". Our work attempts to clarify the scope of "reproducibility" as displayed by the community at large. In doing so, we propose to refine the research to eight general topic areas. In this light, we see that each of these areas contains many works that do not advertise themselves as being about "reproducibility", in part because they go back decades before the matter came to broader attention.</description>

      <title>Training MLPs on Graphs without Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various graph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during inference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial.

      <title>GP-FL: Model-Based Hessian Estimation for Second-Order Over-the-Air Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order methods are widely adopted to improve the convergence rate of learning algorithms. In federated learning (FL), these methods require the clients to share their local Hessian matrices with the parameter server (PS), which comes at a prohibitive communication cost. A classical solution to this issue is to approximate the global Hessian matrix from the first-order information. Unlike in idealized networks, this solution does not perform effectively in over-the-air FL settings, where the PS receives noisy versions of the local gradients. This paper introduces a novel second-order FL framework tailored for wireless channels. The pivotal innovation lies in the PS's capability to directly estimate the global Hessian matrix from the received noisy local gradients via a non-parametric method: the PS models the unknown Hessian matrix as a Gaussian process, and then uses the temporal relation between the gradients and Hessian along with the channel model to find a stochastic estimator for the global Hessian matrix. We refer to this method as Gaussian process-based Hessian modeling for wireless FL (GP-FL) and show that it exhibits a linear-quadratic convergence rate. Numerical experiments on various datasets demonstrate that GP-FL outperforms all classical baseline first and second order FL approaches.</description>

      <title>Transferring self-supervised pre-trained models for SHM data anomaly detection with scarce labeled data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) has experienced significant advancements in recent decades, accumulating massive monitoring data. Data anomalies inevitably exist in monitoring data, posing significant challenges to their effective utilization. Recently, deep learning has emerged as an efficient and effective approach for anomaly detection in bridge SHM. Despite its progress, many deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data for training. The process of labeling data, however, is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often impractical for large-scale SHM datasets. To address these challenges, this work explores the use of self-supervised learning (SSL), an emerging paradigm that combines unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. The SSL-based framework aims to learn from only a very small quantity of labeled data by fine-tuning, while making the best use of the vast amount of unlabeled SHM data by pre-training. Mainstream SSL methods are compared and validated on the SHM data of two in-service bridges. Comparative analysis demonstrates that SSL techniques boost data anomaly detection performance, achieving increased F1 scores compared to conventional supervised training, especially given a very limited amount of labeled data. This work manifests the effectiveness and superiority of SSL techniques on large-scale SHM data, providing an efficient tool for preliminary anomaly detection with scarce label information.</description>

      <title>Weak-to-Strong Generalization Through the Data-Centric Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak-to-strong generalization phenomenon is the driver for important machine learning applications including highly data-efficient learning and, most recently, performing superalignment. While decades of research have resulted in numerous algorithms that produce strong empirical performance, understanding what aspects of data enable weak-to-strong generalization has been understudied. We propose a simple data-centric mechanism that characterizes weak-to-strong generalization: the overlap density. Intuitively, generalization tracks the number of points that contain overlaps, i.e., both easy patterns (learnable by a weak model) and challenging patterns (only learnable by a stronger model), as with such points, weak predictions can be used to learn challenging patterns by stronger models. We provide a practical overlap detection algorithm to find such points in datasets and leverage them to learn, among multiple sources of data, which to query when seeking to maximize overlap density and thereby enhance weak-to-strong generalization. We present a theoretical result showing that the generalization benefit is a function of the overlap density and a regret bound for our data selection algorithm. Empirically, we validate the mechanism and the overlap detection algorithm on a wide array of settings.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Android Intrusion Detection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The android operating system is being installed in most of the smart devices. The introduction of intrusions in such operating systems is rising at a tremendous rate. With the introduction of such malicious data streams, the smart devices are being subjected to various attacks like Phishing, Spyware, SMS Fraud, Bots and Banking-Trojans and many such. The application of machine learning classification algorithms for the security of android APK files is used in this paper. Each apk data stream was marked to be either malicious or non malicious on the basis of different parameters. The machine learning classification techniques are then used to classify whether the newly installed applications' signature falls within the malicious or non-malicious domain. If it falls within the malicious category, appropriate action can be taken, and the Android operating system can be shielded against illegal activities.</description>

      <title>Final-Model-Only Data Attribution with a Unifying View of Gradient-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) is the task of attributing model behavior to elements in the training data. This paper draws attention to the common setting where one has access only to the final trained model, and not the training algorithm or intermediate information from training. To serve as a gold standard for TDA in this "final-model-only" setting, we propose further training, with appropriate adjustment and averaging, to measure the sensitivity of the given model to training instances. We then unify existing gradient-based methods for TDA by showing that they all approximate the further training gold standard in different ways. We investigate empirically the quality of these gradient-based approximations to further training, for tabular, image, and text datasets and models. We find that the approximation quality of first-order methods is sometimes high but decays with the amount of further training. In contrast, the approximations given by influence function methods are more stable but surprisingly lower in quality.</description>

      <title>Graph Disentangle Causal Model: Enhancing Causal Inference in Networked Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating individual treatment effects (ITE) from observational data is a critical task across various domains. However, many existing works on ITE estimation overlook the influence of hidden confounders, which remain unobserved at the individual unit level. To address this limitation, researchers have utilized graph neural networks to aggregate neighbors' features to capture the hidden confounders and mitigate confounding bias by minimizing the discrepancy of confounder representations between the treated and control groups. Despite the success of these approaches, practical scenarios often treat all features as confounders and involve substantial differences in feature distributions between the treated and control groups. Confusing the adjustment and confounder and enforcing strict balance on the confounder representations could potentially undermine the effectiveness of outcome prediction. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework called the \textit{Graph Disentangle Causal model} (GDC) to conduct ITE estimation in the network setting. GDC utilizes a causal disentangle module to separate unit features into adjustment and confounder representations. Then we design a graph aggregation module consisting of three distinct graph aggregators to obtain adjustment, confounder, and counterfactual confounder representations. Finally, a causal constraint module is employed to enforce the disentangled representations as true causal factors. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by conducting comprehensive experiments on two networked datasets.</description>

      <title>Quantized and Interpretable Learning Scheme for Deep Neural Networks in Classification Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have proven highly effective in image classification, but their deployment in resourceconstrained environments remains challenging due to high computational demands. Furthermore, their interpretability is of high importance which demands even more available resources. In this work, we introduce an approach that combines saliency-guided training with quantization techniques to create an interpretable and resource-efficient model without compromising accuracy. We utilize Parameterized Clipping Activation (PACT) to perform quantization-aware training, specifically targeting activations and weights to optimize precision while minimizing resource usage. Concurrently, saliency-guided training is employed to enhance interpretability by iteratively masking features with low gradient values, leading to more focused and meaningful saliency maps. This training procedure helps in mitigating noisy gradients and yields models that provide clearer, more interpretable insights into their decision-making processes. To evaluate the impact of our approach, we conduct experiments using famous Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 benchmark datasets as two popular datasets. We compare the saliency maps generated by standard and quantized models to assess the influence of quantization on both interpretability and classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the combined use of saliency-guided training and PACT-based quantization not only maintains classification performance but also produces models that are significantly more efficient and interpretable, making them suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>JANUS: A Difference-Oriented Analyzer For Financial Centralization Risks in Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some smart contracts violate decentralization principles by defining privileged accounts that manage other users' assets without permission, introducing centralization risks that have caused financial losses. Existing methods, however, face challenges in accurately detecting diverse centralization risks due to their dependence on predefined behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose JANUS, an automated analyzer for Solidity smart contracts that detects financial centralization risks independently of their specific behaviors. JANUS identifies differences between states reached by privileged and ordinary accounts, and analyzes whether these differences are finance-related. Focusing on the impact of risks rather than behaviors, JANUS achieves improved accuracy compared to existing tools and can uncover centralization risks with unknown patterns.
  To evaluate JANUS's performance, we compare it with other tools using a dataset of 540 contracts. Our evaluation demonstrates that JANUS outperforms representative tools in terms of detection accuracy for financial centralization risks . Additionally, we evaluate JANUS on a real-world dataset of 33,151 contracts, successfully identifying two types of risks that other tools fail to detect. We also prove that the state traversal method and variable summaries, which are used in JANUS to reduce the number of states to be compared, do not introduce false alarms or omissions in detection.</description>

      <title>BEFL: Balancing Energy Consumption in Federated Learning for Mobile Edge IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm designed to build a highly accurate global model. In Mobile Edge IoT (MEIoT), the training and communication processes can significantly deplete the limited battery resources of devices. Existing research primarily focuses on reducing overall energy consumption, but this may inadvertently create energy consumption imbalances, leading to the premature dropout of energy-sensitive devices.To address these challenges, we propose BEFL, a joint optimization framework aimed at balancing three objectives: enhancing global model accuracy, minimizing total energy consumption, and reducing energy usage disparities among devices. First, taking into account the communication constraints of MEIoT and the heterogeneity of devices, we employed the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm for the rational allocation of communication resources. Based on this, we introduce a heuristic client selection algorithm that combines cluster partitioning with utility-driven approaches to alleviate both the total energy consumption of all devices and the discrepancies in energy usage.Furthermore, we utilize the proposed heuristic client selection algorithm as a template for offline imitation learning during pre-training, while adopting a ranking-based reinforcement learning approach online to further boost training efficiency. Our experiments reveal that BEFL improves global model accuracy by 1.6\%, reduces energy consumption variance by 72.7\%, and lowers total energy consumption by 28.2\% compared to existing methods.

      <title>Electronic Health Records-Based Data-Driven Diabetes Knowledge Unveiling and Risk Prognosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the healthcare sector, the application of deep learning technologies has revolutionized data analysis and disease forecasting. This is particularly evident in the field of diabetes, where the deep analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has unlocked new opportunities for early detection and effective intervention strategies. Our research presents an innovative model that synergizes the capabilities of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks-Conditional Random Field (BiLSTM-CRF) with a fusion of XGBoost and Logistic Regression. This model is designed to enhance the accuracy of diabetes risk prediction by conducting an in-depth analysis of electronic medical records data. The first phase of our approach involves employing BiLSTM-CRF to delve into the temporal characteristics and latent patterns present in EHR data. This method effectively uncovers the progression trends of diabetes, which are often hidden in the complex data structures of medical records. The second phase leverages the combined strength of XGBoost and Logistic Regression to classify these extracted features and evaluate associated risks. This dual approach facilitates a more nuanced and precise prediction of diabetes, outperforming traditional models, particularly in handling multifaceted and nonlinear medical datasets. Our research demonstrates a notable advancement in diabetes prediction over traditional methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our combined BiLSTM-CRF, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression model. This study highlights the value of data-driven strategies in clinical decision-making, equipping healthcare professionals with precise tools for early detection and intervention. By enabling personalized treatment and timely care, our approach signifies progress in incorporating advanced analytics in healthcare, potentially improving outcomes for diabetes and other chronic conditions.</description>

      <title>Local Curvature Smoothing with Stein's Identity for Efficient Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training of score-based diffusion models (SDMs) is based on score matching. The challenge of score matching is that it includes a computationally expensive Jacobian trace. While several methods have been proposed to avoid this computation, each has drawbacks, such as instability during training and approximating the learning as learning a denoising vector field rather than a true score. We propose a novel score matching variant, local curvature smoothing with Stein's identity (LCSS). The LCSS bypasses the Jacobian trace by applying Stein's identity, enabling regularization effectiveness and efficient computation. We show that LCSS surpasses existing methods in sample generation performance and matches the performance of denoising score matching, widely adopted by most SDMs, in evaluations such as FID, Inception score, and bits per dimension. Furthermore, we show that LCSS enables realistic image generation even at a high resolution of $1024 \times 1024$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Graph Representation with Contrastive Learning for Financial Market Prediction: Integrating Temporal Evolution and Static Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Graph Learning (TGL) is crucial for capturing the evolving nature of stock markets. Traditional methods often ignore the interplay between dynamic temporal changes and static relational structures between stocks. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Graph Representation with Contrastive Learning (DGRCL) framework, which integrates dynamic and static graph relations to improve the accuracy of stock trend prediction. Our framework introduces two key components: the Embedding Enhancement (EE) module and the Contrastive Constrained Training (CCT) module. The EE module focuses on dynamically capturing the temporal evolution of stock data, while the CCT module enforces static constraints based on stock relations, refined within contrastive learning. This dual-relation approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of stock market dynamics. Our experiments on two major U.S. stock market datasets, NASDAQ and NYSE, demonstrate that DGRCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TGL baselines. Ablation studies indicate the importance of both modules. Overall, DGRCL not only enhances prediction ability but also provides a robust framework for integrating temporal and relational data in dynamic graphs. Code and data are available for public access.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Need Cluster-Normalize-Activate Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are non-Euclidean deep learning models for graph-structured data. Despite their successful and diverse applications, oversmoothing prohibits deep architectures due to node features converging to a single fixed point. This severely limits their potential to solve complex tasks. To counteract this tendency, we propose a plug-and-play module consisting of three steps: Cluster-Normalize-Activate (CNA). By applying CNA modules, GNNs search and form super nodes in each layer, which are normalized and activated individually. We demonstrate in node classification and property prediction tasks that CNA significantly improves the accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Particularly, CNA reaches 94.18% and 95.75% accuracy on Cora and CiteSeer, respectively. It further benefits GNNs in regression tasks as well, reducing the mean squared error compared to all baselines. At the same time, GNNs with CNA require substantially fewer learnable parameters than competing architectures.</description>

      <title>Space to Policy: Scalable Brick Kiln Detection and Automatic Compliance Monitoring with Geospatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution kills 7 million people annually. The brick kiln sector significantly contributes to economic development but also accounts for 8-14\% of air pollution in India. Policymakers have implemented compliance measures to regulate brick kilns. Emission inventories are critical for air quality modeling and source apportionment studies. However, the largely unorganized nature of the brick kiln sector necessitates labor-intensive survey efforts for monitoring. Recent efforts by air quality researchers have relied on manual annotation of brick kilns using satellite imagery to build emission inventories, but this approach lacks scalability. Machine-learning-based object detection methods have shown promise for detecting brick kilns; however, previous studies often rely on costly high-resolution imagery and fail to integrate with governmental policies. In this work, we developed a scalable machine-learning pipeline that detected and classified 30638 brick kilns across five states in the Indo-Gangetic Plain using free, moderate-resolution satellite imagery from Planet Labs. Our detections have a high correlation with on-ground surveys. We performed automated compliance analysis based on government policies. In the Delhi airshed, stricter policy enforcement has led to the adoption of efficient brick kiln technologies. This study highlights the need for inclusive policies that balance environmental sustainability with the livelihoods of workers.</description>

      <title>Boundary-Guided Learning for Gene Expression Prediction in Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as an advanced technology that provides spatial context to gene expression. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown the capability to predict gene expression from WSI data using ST data. Existing approaches typically extract features from images and the neighboring regions using pretrained models, and then develop methods to fuse this information to generate the final output. However, these methods often fail to account for the cellular structure similarity, cellular density and the interactions within the microenvironment. In this paper, we propose a framework named BG-TRIPLEX, which leverages boundary information extracted from pathological images as guiding features to enhance gene expression prediction from WSIs. Specifically, our model consists of three branches: the spot, in-context and global branches. In the spot and in-context branches, boundary information, including edge and nuclei characteristics, is extracted using pretrained models. These boundary features guide the learning of cellular morphology and the characteristics of microenvironment through Multi-Head Cross-Attention. Finally, these features are integrated with global features to predict the final output. Extensive experiments were conducted on three public ST datasets. The results demonstrate that our BG-TRIPLEX consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). This method highlights the crucial role of boundary features in understanding the complex interactions between WSI and gene expression, offering a promising direction for future research.</description>

      <title>Distance-Adaptive Quaternion Knowledge Graph Embedding with Bidirectional Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quaternion contains one real part and three imaginary parts, which provided a more expressive hypercomplex space for learning knowledge graph. Existing quaternion embedding models measure the plausibility of a triplet either through semantic matching or geometric distance scoring functions. However, it appears that semantic matching diminishes the separability of entities, while the distance scoring function weakens the semantics of entities. To address this issue, we propose a novel quaternion knowledge graph embedding model. Our model combines semantic matching with entity's geometric distance to better measure the plausibility of triplets. Specifically, in the quaternion space, we perform a right rotation on head entity and a reverse rotation on tail entity to learn rich semantic features. Then, we utilize distance adaptive translations to learn geometric distance between entities. Furthermore, we provide mathematical proofs to demonstrate our model can handle complex logical relationships.

      <title>Towards Generalizable Autonomous Penetration Testing via Domain Randomization and Meta-Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing numbers of vulnerabilities exposed on the internet, autonomous penetration testing (pentesting) has emerged as an emerging research area, while reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for studying autonomous pentesting. Previous research in RL-based autonomous pentesting mainly focused on enhancing agents' learning efficacy within abstract simulated training environments. They overlooked the applicability and generalization requirements of deploying agents' policies in real-world environments that differ substantially from their training settings. In contrast, for the first time, we shift focus to the pentesting agents' ability to generalize across unseen real environments. For this purpose, we propose a Generalizable Autonomous Pentesting framework (namely GAP) for training agents capable of drawing inferences from one to another -- a key requirement for the broad application of autonomous pentesting and a hallmark of human intelligence. GAP introduces a Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipeline with two key methods: domain randomization and meta-RL learning. Specifically, we are among the first to apply domain randomization in autonomous pentesting and propose a large language model-powered domain randomization method for synthetic environment generation. We further apply meta-RL to improve the agents' generalization ability in unseen environments by leveraging the synthetic environments. The combination of these two methods can effectively bridge the generalization gap and improve policy adaptation performance. Experiments are conducted on various vulnerable virtual machines, with results showing that GAP can (a) enable policy learning in unknown real environments, (b) achieve zero-shot policy transfer in similar environments, and (c) realize rapid policy adaptation in dissimilar environments.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning in Mobile Networks: A Comprehensive Case Study on Traffic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for efficient resource allocation in mobile networks has catalyzed the exploration of innovative solutions that could enhance the task of real-time cellular traffic prediction. Under these circumstances, federated learning (FL) stands out as a distributed and privacy-preserving solution to foster collaboration among different sites, thus enabling responsive near-the-edge solutions. In this paper, we comprehensively study the potential benefits of FL in telecommunications through a case study on federated traffic forecasting using real-world data from base stations (BSs) in Barcelona (Spain). Our study encompasses relevant aspects within the federated experience, including model aggregation techniques, outlier management, the impact of individual clients, personalized learning, and the integration of exogenous sources of data. The performed evaluation is based on both prediction accuracy and sustainability, thus showcasing the environmental impact of employed FL algorithms in various settings. The findings from our study highlight FL as a promising and robust solution for mobile traffic prediction, emphasizing its twin merits as a privacy-conscious and environmentally sustainable approach, while also demonstrating its capability to overcome data heterogeneity and ensure high-quality predictions, marking a significant stride towards its integration in mobile traffic management systems.</description>

      <title>Learnable Similarity and Dissimilarity Guided Symmetric Non-Negative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (SymNMF) is a powerful tool for clustering, which typically uses the $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) method to construct similarity matrix. However, $k$-NN may mislead clustering since the neighbors may belong to different clusters, and its reliability generally decreases as $k$ grows. In this paper, we construct the similarity matrix as a weighted $k$-NN graph with learnable weight that reflects the reliability of each $k$-th NN. This approach reduces the search space of the similarity matrix learning to $n - 1$ dimension, as opposed to the $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ dimension of existing methods, where $n$ represents the number of samples. Moreover, to obtain a discriminative similarity matrix, we introduce a dissimilarity matrix with a dual structure of the similarity matrix, and propose a new form of orthogonality regularization with discussions on its geometric interpretation and numerical stability. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm is designed to solve the proposed model, with theoretically guarantee that the variables converge to a stationary point that satisfies the KKT conditions. The advantage of the proposed model is demonstrated by the comparison with nine state-of-the-art clustering methods on eight datasets.

      <title>DeepFEA: Deep Learning for Prediction of Transient Finite Element Analysis Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful but computationally intensive method for simulating physical phenomena. Recent advancements in machine learning have led to surrogate models capable of accelerating FEA. Yet there are still limitations in developing surrogates of transient FEA models that can simultaneously predict the solutions for both nodes and elements with applicability on both the 2D and 3D domains. Motivated by this research gap, this study proposes DeepFEA, a deep learning-based framework that leverages a multilayer Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network branching into two parallel convolutional neural networks to predict the solutions for both nodes and elements of FEA models. The proposed network is optimized using a novel adaptive learning algorithm, called Node-Element Loss Optimization (NELO). NELO minimizes the error occurring at both branches of the network enabling the prediction of solutions for transient FEA simulations. The experimental evaluation of DeepFEA is performed on three datasets in the context of structural mechanics, generated to serve as publicly available reference datasets. The results show that DeepFEA can achieve less than 3% normalized mean and root mean squared error for 2D and 3D simulation scenarios, and inference times that are two orders of magnitude faster than FEA. In contrast, relevant state-of-the-art methods face challenges with multi-dimensional output and dynamic input prediction. Furthermore, DeepFEA's robustness was demonstrated in a real-life biomedical scenario, confirming its suitability for accurate and efficient predictions of FEA simulations.</description>

      <title>Compositional Generative Multiphysics and Multi-component Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphysics simulation, which models the interactions between multiple physical processes, and multi-component simulation of complex structures are critical in fields like nuclear and aerospace engineering. Previous studies often rely on numerical solvers or machine learning-based surrogate models to solve or accelerate these simulations. However, multiphysics simulations typically require integrating multiple specialized solvers-each responsible for evolving a specific physical process-into a coupled program, which introduces significant development challenges. Furthermore, no universal algorithm exists for multi-component simulations, which adds to the complexity. Here we propose compositional Multiphysics and Multi-component Simulation with Diffusion models (MultiSimDiff) to overcome these challenges. During diffusion-based training, MultiSimDiff learns energy functions modeling the conditional probability of one physical process/component conditioned on other processes/components. In inference, MultiSimDiff generates coupled multiphysics solutions and multi-component structures by sampling from the joint probability distribution, achieved by composing the learned energy functions in a structured way. We test our method in three tasks. In the reaction-diffusion and nuclear thermal coupling problems, MultiSimDiff successfully predicts the coupling solution using decoupled data, while the surrogate model fails in the more complex second problem. For the thermal and mechanical analysis of the prismatic fuel element, MultiSimDiff trained for single component prediction accurately predicts a larger structure with 64 components, reducing the relative error by 40.3% compared to the surrogate model.</description>

      <title>Understanding Memorization in Generative Models via Sharpness in Probability Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a geometric framework to analyze memorization in diffusion models using the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the log probability density. We propose that memorization arises from isolated points in the learned probability distribution, characterized by sharpness in the probability landscape, as indicated by large negative eigenvalues of the Hessian. Through experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate that these eigenvalues effectively detect and quantify memorization. Our approach provides a clear understanding of memorization in diffusion models and lays the groundwork for developing strategies to ensure secure and reliable generative models</description>

      <title>MultiTASC++: A Continuously Adaptive Scheduler for Edge-Based Multi-Device Cascade Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascade systems, consisting of a lightweight model processing all samples and a heavier, high-accuracy model refining challenging samples, have become a widely-adopted distributed inference approach to achieving high accuracy and maintaining a low computational burden for mobile and IoT devices. As intelligent indoor environments, like smart homes, continue to expand, a new scenario emerges, the multi-device cascade. In this setting, multiple diverse devices simultaneously utilize a shared heavy model hosted on a server, often situated within or close to the consumer environment. This work introduces MultiTASC++, a continuously adaptive multi-tenancy-aware scheduler that dynamically controls the forwarding decision functions of devices to optimize system throughput while maintaining high accuracy and low latency. Through extensive experimentation in diverse device environments and with varying server-side models, we demonstrate the scheduler's efficacy in consistently maintaining a targeted satisfaction rate while providing the highest available accuracy across different device tiers and workloads of up to 100 devices. This demonstrates its scalability and efficiency in addressing the unique challenges of collaborative DNN inference in dynamic and diverse IoT environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the importance of individual training samples is a key challenge in machine learning. Traditional approaches retrain models with and without specific samples, which is computationally expensive and ignores dependencies between data points. We introduce LossVal, an efficient data valuation method that computes importance scores during neural network training by embedding a self-weighting mechanism into loss functions like cross-entropy and mean squared error. LossVal reduces computational costs, making it suitable for large datasets and practical applications. Experiments on classification and regression tasks across multiple datasets show that LossVal effectively identifies noisy samples and is able to distinguish helpful from harmful samples. We examine the gradient calculation of LossVal to highlight its advantages. The source code is available at: https://github.com/twibiral/LossVal</description>

      <title>An In-Depth Examination of Risk Assessment in Multi-Class Classification Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced classification algorithms are being increasingly used in safety-critical applications like health-care, engineering, etc. In such applications, miss-classifications made by ML algorithms can result in substantial financial or health-related losses. To better anticipate and prepare for such losses, the algorithm user seeks an estimate for the probability that the algorithm miss-classifies a sample. We refer to this task as the risk-assessment. For a variety of models and datasets, we numerically analyze the performance of different methods in solving the risk-assessment problem. We consider two solution strategies: a) calibration techniques that calibrate the output probabilities of classification models to provide accurate probability outputs; and b) a novel approach based upon the prediction interval generation technique of conformal prediction. Our conformal prediction based approach is model and data-distribution agnostic, simple to implement, and provides reasonable results for a variety of use-cases. We compare the different methods on a broad variety of models and datasets.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Mean Gaussian Processes for Post-hoc Bayesian Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in performing post-hoc uncertainty estimation about the predictions of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs). Given a pre-trained DNN via back-propagation, these methods enhance the original network by adding output confidence measures, such as error bars, without compromising its initial accuracy. In this context, we introduce a novel family of sparse variational Gaussian processes (GPs), where the posterior mean is fixed to any continuous function when using a universal kernel. Specifically, we fix the mean of this GP to the output of the pre-trained DNN, allowing our approach to effectively fit the GP's predictive variances to estimate the DNN prediction uncertainty. Our approach leverages variational inference (VI) for efficient stochastic optimization, with training costs that remain independent of the number of training points, scaling efficiently to large datasets such as ImageNet. The proposed method, called fixed mean GP (FMGP), is architecture-agnostic, relying solely on the pre-trained model's outputs to adjust the predictive variances. Experimental results demonstrate that FMGP improves both uncertainty estimation and computational efficiency when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>SKIM: Any-bit Quantization Pushing The Limits of Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance across various tasks, but deploying them for inference poses challenges. Their high resource demands often necessitate complex, costly multi-GPU pipelines, or the use of smaller, less capable models. While quantization offers a promising solution utilizing lower precision for model storage, existing methods frequently experience significant performance drops at lower precision levels. Additionally, they typically provide only a limited set of solutions at specific bit levels, many of which are extensively manually tuned. To address these challenges, we propose a new method called SKIM: Scaled K-means clustering wIth Mixed precision. Our approach introduces two novel techniques: 1. A greedy algorithm to solve approximately optimal bit allocation across weight channels, and 2. A trainable scaling vector for non-differentiable K-means clustering. These techniques substantially improve performance and can be adapted to any given bit. Notably, in terms of model perplexity, our method narrows the gap between 3-bit quantized LLaMA models and their full precision counterparts by 16.3% on average.</description>

      <title>Linear Discriminant Analysis in Credit Scoring: A Transparent Hybrid Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of computing has made credit scoring approaches possible, with various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques becoming more and more valuable. While complex models yield more accurate predictions, their interpretability is often weakened, which is a concern for credit scoring that places importance on decision fairness. As features of the dataset are a crucial factor for the credit scoring system, we implement Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) as a feature reduction technique, which reduces the burden of the models complexity. We compared 6 different machine learning models, 1 deep learning model, and a hybrid model with and without using LDA. From the result, we have found our hybrid model, XG-DNN, outperformed other models with the highest accuracy of 99.45% and a 99% F1 score with LDA. Lastly, to interpret model decisions, we have applied 2 different explainable AI techniques named LIME (local) and Morris Sensitivity Analysis (global). Through this research, we showed how feature reduction techniques can be used without affecting the performance and explainability of the model, which can be very useful in resource-constrained settings to optimize the computational workload.</description>

      <title>Directed Structural Adaptation to Overcome Statistical Conflicts and Enable Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive networks today rely on overparameterized fixed topologies that cannot break through the statistical conflicts they encounter in the data they are exposed to, and are prone to "catastrophic forgetting" as the network attempts to reuse the existing structures to learn new task. We propose a structural adaptation method, DIRAD, that can complexify as needed and in a directed manner without being limited by statistical conflicts within a dataset. We then extend this method and present the PREVAL framework, designed to prevent "catastrophic forgetting" in continual learning by detection of new data and assigning encountered data to suitable models adapted to process them, without needing task labels anywhere in the workflow. We show the reliability of the DIRAD in growing a network with high performance and orders-of-magnitude simpler than fixed topology networks; and demonstrate the proof-of-concept operation of PREVAL, in which continual adaptation to new tasks is observed while being able to detect and discern previously-encountered tasks.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Deep Learning for Muscle Force Prediction with Unlabeled sEMG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational biomechanical analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding and improving human movements and physical functions. Although physics-based modeling methods can interpret the dynamic interaction between the neural drive to muscle dynamics and joint kinematics, they suffer from high computational latency. In recent years, data-driven methods have emerged as a promising alternative due to their fast execution speed, but label information is still required during training, which is not easy to acquire in practice. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a novel physics-informed deep learning method to predict muscle forces without any label information during model training. In addition, the proposed method could also identify personalized muscle-tendon parameters. To achieve this, the Hill muscle model-based forward dynamics is embedded into the deep neural network as the additional loss to further regulate the behavior of the deep neural network. Experimental validations on the wrist joint from six healthy subjects are performed, and a fully connected neural network (FNN) is selected to implement the proposed method. The predicted results of muscle forces show comparable or even lower root mean square error (RMSE) and higher coefficient of determination compared with baseline methods, which have to use the labeled surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, and it can also identify muscle-tendon parameters accurately, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed physics-informed deep learning method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking entities such as algorithms, devices, methods, or models based on their performances, while accounting for application-specific preferences, is a challenge. To address this challenge, we establish the foundations of a universal theory for performance-based ranking. First, we introduce a rigorous framework built on top of both the probability and order theories. Our new framework encompasses the elements necessary to (1) manipulate performances as mathematical objects, (2) express which performances are worse than or equivalent to others, (3) model tasks through a variable called satisfaction, (4) consider properties of the evaluation, (5) define scores, and (6) specify application-specific preferences through a variable called importance. On top of this framework, we propose the first axiomatic definition of performance orderings and performance-based rankings. Then, we introduce a universal parametric family of scores, called ranking scores, that can be used to establish rankings satisfying our axioms, while considering application-specific preferences. Finally, we show, in the case of two-class classification, that the family of ranking scores encompasses well-known performance scores, including the accuracy, the true positive rate (recall, sensitivity), the true negative rate (specificity), the positive predictive value (precision), and F1. However, we also show that some other scores commonly used to compare classifiers are unsuitable to derive performance orderings satisfying the axioms. Therefore, this paper provides the computer vision and machine learning communities with a rigorous framework for evaluating and ranking entities.</description>

      <title>HyperMARL: Adaptive Hypernetworks for Multi-Agent RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing individual specialisation and shared behaviours is a critical challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Existing methods typically focus on encouraging diversity or leveraging shared representations. Full parameter sharing (FuPS) improves sample efficiency but struggles to learn diverse behaviours when required, while no parameter sharing (NoPS) enables diversity but is computationally expensive and sample inefficient. To address these challenges, we introduce HyperMARL, a novel approach using hypernetworks to balance efficiency and specialisation. HyperMARL generates agent-specific actor and critic parameters, enabling agents to adaptively exhibit diverse or homogeneous behaviours as needed, without modifying the learning objective or requiring prior knowledge of the optimal diversity. Furthermore, HyperMARL decouples agent-specific and state-based gradients, which empirically correlates with reduced policy gradient variance, potentially offering insights into its ability to capture diverse behaviours. Across MARL benchmarks requiring homogeneous, heterogeneous, or mixed behaviours, HyperMARL consistently matches or outperforms FuPS, NoPS, and diversity-focused methods, achieving NoPS-level diversity with a shared architecture. These results highlight the potential of hypernetworks as a versatile approach to the trade-off between specialisation and shared behaviours in MARL.</description>

      <title>A History of Philosophy in Colombia through Topic Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven approaches to philosophy have emerged as a valuable tool for studying the history of the discipline. However, most studies in this area have focused on a limited number of journals from specific regions and subfields. We expand the scope of this research by applying dynamic topic modelling techniques to explore the history of philosophy in Colombia and Latin America. Our study examines the Colombian philosophy journal Ideas y Valores, founded in 1951 and currently one of the most influential academic philosophy journals in the region. By analyzing the evolution of topics across the journal's history, we identify various trends and specific dynamics in philosophical discourse within the Colombian and Latin American context. Our findings reveal that the most prominent topics are value theory (including ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics), epistemology, and the philosophy of science. We also trace the evolution of articles focusing on the historical and interpretive aspects of philosophical texts, and we note a notable emphasis on German philosophers such as Kant, Husserl, and Hegel on various topics throughout the journal's lifetime. Additionally, we investigate whether articles with a historical focus have decreased over time due to editorial pressures. Our analysis suggests no significant decline in such articles. Finally, we propose ideas for extending this research to other Latin American journals and suggest improvements for natural language processing workflows in non-English languages.</description>

      <title>LMDM:Latent Molecular Diffusion Model For 3D Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: n this work, we propose a latent molecular diffusion model that can make the generated 3D molecules rich in diversity and maintain rich geometric features. The model captures the information of the forces and local constraints between atoms so that the generated molecules can maintain Euclidean transformation and high level of effectiveness and diversity. We also use the lowerrank manifold advantage of the latent variables of the latent model to fuse the information of the forces between atoms to better maintain the geometric equivariant properties of the molecules. Because there is no need to perform information fusion encoding in stages like traditional encoders and decoders, this reduces the amount of calculation in the back-propagation process. The model keeps the forces and local constraints of particle bonds in the latent variable space, reducing the impact of underfitting on the surface of the network on the large position drift of the particle geometry, so that our model can converge earlier. We introduce a distribution control variable in each backward step to strengthen exploration and improve the diversity of generation. In the experiment, the quality of the samples we generated and the convergence speed of the model have been significantly improved.</description>

      <title>SynFinTabs: A Dataset of Synthetic Financial Tables for Information and Table Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table extraction from document images is a challenging AI problem, and labelled data for many content domains is difficult to come by. Existing table extraction datasets often focus on scientific tables due to the vast amount of academic articles that are readily available, along with their source code. However, there are significant layout and typographical differences between tables found across scientific, financial, and other domains. Current datasets often lack the words, and their positions, contained within the tables, instead relying on unreliable OCR to extract these features for training modern machine learning models on natural language processing tasks. Therefore, there is a need for a more general method of obtaining labelled data. We present SynFinTabs, a large-scale, labelled dataset of synthetic financial tables. Our hope is that our method of generating these synthetic tables is transferable to other domains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset in training models to extract information from table images, we create FinTabQA, a layout large language model trained on an extractive question-answering task. We test our model using real-world financial tables and compare it to a state-of-the-art generative model and discuss the results. We make the dataset, model, and dataset generation code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Vector-valued Prediction: From Linear Models to Stochastic Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning vector-valued linear predictors: these are prediction rules parameterized by a matrix that maps an $m$-dimensional feature vector to a $k$-dimensional target. We focus on the fundamental case with a convex and Lipschitz loss function, and show several new theoretical results that shed light on the complexity of this problem and its connection to related learning models. First, we give a tight characterization of the sample complexity of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) in this setting, establishing that $\smash{\widetilde{\Omega}}(k/\epsilon^2)$ examples are necessary for ERM to reach $\epsilon$ excess (population) risk; this provides for an exponential improvement over recent results by Magen and Shamir (2023) in terms of the dependence on the target dimension $k$, and matches a classical upper bound due to Maurer (2016). Second, we present a black-box conversion from general $d$-dimensional Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO) to vector-valued linear prediction, showing that any SCO problem can be embedded as a prediction problem with $k=\Theta(d)$ outputs. These results portray the setting of vector-valued linear prediction as bridging between two extensively studied yet disparate learning models: linear models (corresponds to $k=1$) and general $d$-dimensional SCO (with $k=\Theta(d)$).</description>

      <title>Deep Causal Inference for Point-referenced Spatial Data with Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal reasoning is often challenging with spatial data, particularly when handling high-dimensional inputs. To address this, we propose a neural network (NN) based framework integrated with an approximate Gaussian process to manage spatial interference and unobserved confounding. Additionally, we adopt a generalized propensity-score-based approach to address partially observed outcomes when estimating causal effects with continuous treatments. We evaluate our framework using synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data inferred from satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that NN-based models significantly outperform linear spatial regression models in estimating causal effects. Furthermore, in real-world case studies, NN-based models offer more reasonable predictions of causal effects, facilitating decision-making in relevant applications.</description>

      <title>GRAM: Generalization in Deep RL with a Robust Adaptation Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable deployment of deep reinforcement learning in real-world settings requires the ability to generalize across a variety of conditions, including both in-distribution scenarios seen during training as well as novel out-of-distribution scenarios. In this work, we present a framework for dynamics generalization in deep reinforcement learning that unifies these two distinct types of generalization within a single architecture. We introduce a robust adaptation module that provides a mechanism for identifying and reacting to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution environment dynamics, along with a joint training pipeline that combines the goals of in-distribution adaptation and out-of-distribution robustness. Our algorithm GRAM achieves strong generalization performance across in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios upon deployment, which we demonstrate on a variety of realistic simulated locomotion tasks with a quadruped robot.</description>

      <title>Action Mapping for Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Environments with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has had success across various domains, but applying it to environments with constraints remains challenging due to poor sample efficiency and slow convergence. Recent literature explored incorporating model knowledge to mitigate these problems, particularly through the use of models that assess the feasibility of proposed actions. However, integrating feasibility models efficiently into DRL pipelines in environments with continuous action spaces is non-trivial. We propose a novel DRL training strategy utilizing action mapping that leverages feasibility models to streamline the learning process. By decoupling the learning of feasible actions from policy optimization, action mapping allows DRL agents to focus on selecting the optimal action from a reduced feasible action set. We demonstrate through experiments that action mapping significantly improves training performance in constrained environments with continuous action spaces, especially with imperfect feasibility models.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Performative Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performative prediction aims to model scenarios where predictive outcomes subsequently influence the very systems they target. The pursuit of a performative optimum (PO) -- minimizing performative risk -- is generally reliant on modeling of the distribution map, which characterizes how a deployed ML model alters the data distribution. Unfortunately, inevitable misspecification of the distribution map can lead to a poor approximation of the true PO. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework of distributionally robust performative prediction and study a new solution concept termed as distributionally robust performative optimum (DRPO). We show provable guarantees for DRPO as a robust approximation to the true PO when the nominal distribution map is different from the actual one. Moreover, distributionally robust performative prediction can be reformulated as an augmented performative prediction problem, enabling efficient optimization. The experimental results demonstrate that DRPO offers potential advantages over traditional PO approach when the distribution map is misspecified at either micro- or macro-level.</description>

      <title>Approximate Top-$k$ for Increased Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of bucketed approximate top-$k$ algorithms. Computing top-$k$ exactly suffers from limited parallelism, because the $k$ largest values must be aggregated along the vector, thus is not well suited to computation on highly-parallel machine learning accelerators. By relaxing the requirement that the top-$k$ is exact, bucketed algorithms can dramatically increase the parallelism available by independently computing many smaller top-$k$ operations. We explore the design choices of this class of algorithms using both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on downstream tasks. Our motivating examples are sparsity algorithms for language models, which often use top-$k$ to select the most important parameters or activations. We also release a fast bucketed top-$k$ implementation for PyTorch.</description>

      <title>Machine Theory of Mind for Autonomous Cyber-Defence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent autonomous agents hold much potential for the domain of cyber-security. However, due to many state-of-the-art approaches relying on uninterpretable black-box models, there is growing demand for methods that offer stakeholders clear and actionable insights into their latent beliefs and motivations. To address this, we evaluate Theory of Mind (ToM) approaches for Autonomous Cyber Operations. Upon learning a robust prior, ToM models can predict an agent's goals, behaviours, and contextual beliefs given only a handful of past behaviour observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based ToM architecture tailored for cyber-defence, Graph-In, Graph-Out (GIGO)-ToM, which can accurately predict both the targets and attack trajectories of adversarial cyber agents over arbitrary computer network topologies. To evaluate the latter, we propose a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance for measuring the similarity of graph-based probability distributions. Whereas the standard Wasserstein distance lacks a fixed reference scale, we introduce a graph-theoretic normalization factor that enables a standardized comparison between networks of different sizes. We furnish this metric, which we term the Network Transport Distance (NTD), with a weighting function that emphasizes predictions according to custom node features, allowing network operators to explore arbitrary strategic considerations. Benchmarked against a Graph-In, Dense-Out (GIDO)-ToM architecture in an abstract cyber-defence environment, our empirical evaluations show that GIGO-ToM can accurately predict the goals and behaviours of various unseen cyber-attacking agents across a range of network topologies, as well as learn embeddings that can effectively characterize their policies.</description>

      <title>Finer Behavioral Foundation Models via Auto-Regressive Features and Advantage Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forward-backward representation (FB) is a recently proposed framework (Touati et al., 2023; Touati &amp; Ollivier, 2021) to train behavior foundation models (BFMs) that aim at providing zero-shot efficient policies for any new task specified in a given reinforcement learning (RL) environment, without training for each new task. Here we address two core limitations of FB model training. First, FB, like all successor-feature-based methods, relies on a linear encoding of tasks: at test time, each new reward function is linearly projected onto a fixed set of pre-trained features. This limits expressivity as well as precision of the task representation. We break the linearity limitation by introducing auto-regressive features for FB, which let finegrained task features depend on coarser-grained task information. This can represent arbitrary nonlinear task encodings, thus significantly increasing expressivity of the FB framework. Second, it is well-known that training RL agents from offline datasets often requires specific techniques.We show that FB works well together with such offline RL techniques, by adapting techniques from (Nair et al.,2020b; Cetin et al., 2024) for FB. This is necessary to get non-flatlining performance in some datasets, such as DMC Humanoid. As a result, we produce efficient FB BFMs for a number of new environments. Notably, in the D4RL locomotion benchmark, the generic FB agent matches the performance of standard single-task offline agents (IQL, XQL). In many setups, the offline techniques are needed to get any decent performance at all. The auto-regressive features have a positive but moderate impact, concentrated on tasks requiring spatial precision and task generalization beyond the behaviors represented in the trainset.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Batch Bayesian Optimization with Pipelining Evaluations for Experimental Resource$\unicode{x2013}$constrained Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is efficient even with a small amount of data and is used in engineering and in science, including biology and chemistry. In Bayesian optimization, a parameterized model with an uncertainty is fitted to explain the experimental data, and then the model suggests parameters that would most likely improve the results. Batch Bayesian optimization reduces the processing time of optimization by parallelizing experiments. However, batch Bayesian optimization cannot be applied if the number of parallelized experiments is limited by the cost or scarcity of equipment; in such cases, sequential methods require an unrealistic amount of time. In this study, we developed pipelining Bayesian optimization (PipeBO) to reduce the processing time of optimization even with a limited number of parallel experiments. PipeBO was inspired by the pipelining of central processing unit architecture, which divides computational tasks into multiple processes. PipeBO was designed to achieve experiment parallelization by overlapping various processes of the experiments. PipeBO uses the results of completed experiments to update the parameters of running parallelized experiments. Using the Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking, which consists of 24 benchmark functions, we compared PipeBO with the sequential Bayesian optimization methods. PipeBO reduced the average processing time of optimization to about 56% for the experiments that consisted of two processes or even less for those with more processes for 20 out of the 24 functions. Overall, PipeBO parallelizes Bayesian optimization in the resource-constrained settings so that efficient optimization can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Federated Automated Feature Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated feature engineering (AutoFE) is used to automatically create new features from original features to improve predictive performance without needing significant human intervention and expertise. Many algorithms exist for AutoFE, but very few approaches exist for the federated learning (FL) setting where data is gathered across many clients and is not shared between clients or a central server. We introduce AutoFE algorithms for the horizontal, vertical, and hybrid FL settings, which differ in how the data is gathered across clients. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop AutoFE algorithms for the horizontal and hybrid FL cases, and we show that the downstream model performance of federated AutoFE is similar to the case where data is held centrally and AutoFE is performed centrally.</description>

      <title>Efficient Task Grouping Through Samplewise Optimisation Landscape Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared training approaches, such as multi-task learning (MTL) and gradient-based meta-learning, are widely used in various machine learning applications, but they often suffer from negative transfer, leading to performance degradation in specific tasks. While several optimisation techniques have been developed to mitigate this issue for pre-selected task cohorts, identifying optimal task combinations for joint learning - known as task grouping - remains underexplored and computationally challenging due to the exponential growth in task combinations and the need for extensive training and evaluation cycles. This paper introduces an efficient task grouping framework designed to reduce these overwhelming computational demands of the existing methods. The proposed framework infers pairwise task similarities through a sample-wise optimisation landscape analysis, eliminating the need for the shared model training required to infer task similarities in existing methods. With task similarities acquired, a graph-based clustering algorithm is employed to pinpoint near-optimal task groups, providing an approximate yet efficient and effective solution to the originally NP-hard problem. Empirical assessments conducted on 8 different datasets highlight the effectiveness of the proposed framework, revealing a five-fold speed enhancement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework consistently demonstrates comparable performance, confirming its remarkable efficiency and effectiveness in task grouping.</description>

      <title>FedDUAL: A Dual-Strategy with Adaptive Loss and Dynamic Aggregation for Mitigating Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) marks a transformative approach to distributed model training by combining locally optimized models from various clients into a unified global model. While FL preserves data privacy by eliminating centralized storage, it encounters significant challenges such as performance degradation, slower convergence, and reduced robustness of the global model due to the heterogeneity in client data distributions. Among the various forms of data heterogeneity, label skew emerges as a particularly formidable and prevalent issue, especially in domains such as image classification. To address these challenges, we begin with comprehensive experiments to pinpoint the underlying issues in the FL training process. Based on our findings, we then introduce an innovative dual-strategy approach designed to effectively resolve these issues. First, we introduce an adaptive loss function for client-side training, meticulously crafted to preserve previously acquired knowledge while maintaining an optimal equilibrium between local optimization and global model coherence. Secondly, we develop a dynamic aggregation strategy for aggregating client models at the server. This approach adapts to each client's unique learning patterns, effectively addressing the challenges of diverse data across the network. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across three diverse real-world datasets, coupled with theoretical convergence guarantees, demonstrates the superior efficacy of our method compared to several established state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Marvel: Accelerating Safe Online Reinforcement Learning with Finetuned Offline Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high costs and risks involved in extensive environment interactions hinder the practical application of current online safe reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While offline safe RL addresses this by learning policies from static datasets, the performance therein is usually limited due to reliance on data quality and challenges with out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Inspired by recent successes in offline-to-online (O2O) RL, it is crucial to explore whether offline safe RL can be leveraged to facilitate faster and safer online policy learning, a direction that has yet to be fully investigated. To fill this gap, we first demonstrate that naively applying existing O2O algorithms from standard RL would not work well in the safe RL setting due to two unique challenges: \emph{erroneous Q-estimations}, resulted from offline-online objective mismatch and offline cost sparsity, and \emph{Lagrangian mismatch}, resulted from difficulties in aligning Lagrange multipliers between offline and online policies. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Marvel}, a novel framework for O2O safe RL, comprising two key components that work in concert: \emph{Value Pre-Alignment} to align the Q-functions with the underlying truth before online learning, and \emph{Adaptive PID Control} to effectively adjust the Lagrange multipliers during online finetuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marvel significantly outperforms existing baselines in both reward maximization and safety constraint satisfaction. By introducing the first policy-finetuning based framework for O2O safe RL, which is compatible with many offline and online safe RL methods, our work has the great potential to advance the field towards more efficient and practical safe RL solutions.</description>

      <title>A Survey on E-Commerce Learning to Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In e-commerce, ranking the search results based on users' preference is the most important task. Commercial e-commerce platforms, such as, Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Walmart, etc. perform extensive and relentless research to perfect their search result ranking algorithms because the quality of ranking drives a user's decision to purchase or not to purchase an item, directly affecting the profitability of the e-commerce platform. In such a commercial platforms, for optimizing search result ranking numerous features are considered, which emerge from relevance, personalization, seller's reputation and paid promotion. To maintain their competitive advantage in the market, the platforms do no publish their core ranking algorithms, so it is difficult to know which of the algorithms or which of the features is the most effective for finding the most optimal search result ranking in e-commerce. No extensive surveys of ranking to rank in the e-commerce domain is also not yet published. In this work, we survey the existing e-commerce learning to rank algorithms. Besides, we also compare these algorithms based on query relevance criterion on a large real-life e-commerce dataset and provide a quantitative analysis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such survey which include an experimental comparison among various learning to rank algorithms.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non-Linear Effects of Built Environment on Travel Using an Integrated Machine Learning and Inferential Modeling Approach: A Three-Wave Repeated Cross-Sectional Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamic relationship between the built environment and travel in Austin, Texas, over a 20-year period. Using three waves of household travel surveys from 1997, 2006, and 2017, the research employs a repeated cross-sectional approach to address the limitations of traditional longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. Methodologically, it integrates machine learning and inferential modeling to uncover non-linear relationships and threshold effects of built environment characteristics on travel. Findings reveal that the built environment serves as a sustainable tool for managing travel in the long term, contributing 50% or more to the total feature importance in predicting individual travel-surpassing the combined effects of personal and household characteristics. Increased transit accessibility, local and regional destination accessibility, population and employment density, and diversity significantly reduce travel, particularly within their identified thresholds, though the magnitude of their influence varies across time periods. These findings highlight the potential of smart growth policies-such as expanding transit accessibility, promoting high-density and mixed-use development, and discouraging single-use development and peripheral sprawl-as effective strategies to reduce car dependency and manage travel demand.</description>

      <title>Resampled Mutual Information for Clustering and Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce resampled mutual information (ResMI), a novel measure of clustering similarity that combines insights from information theoretic and pair counting approaches to clustering and community detection. Similar to chance-corrected measures, ResMI satisfies the constant baseline property, but it has the advantages of not requiring adjustment terms and being fully interpretable in the language of information theory. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that ResMI is robust to common biases exhibited by existing measures, particularly in settings with high cluster counts and asymmetric cluster distributions. Additionally, we show that ResMI identifies meaningful community structures in two real contact tracing networks.</description>

      <title>Not All Adapters Matter: Selective Adapter Freezing for Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large-scale pre-trained models achieve great success, and fine-tuning, which tunes a pre-trained model on a task-specific dataset, is the standard practice to utilize these models for downstream tasks. Recent work has developed adapter-tuning, but these approaches either still require a relatively high resource usage. Through our investigation, we show that each adapter in adapter-tuning does not have the same impact on task performance and resource usage. Based on our findings, we propose SAFE, which gradually freezes less-important adapters that do not contribute to adaptation during the early training steps. In our experiments, SAFE reduces memory usage, computation amount, and training time by 42.85\%, 34.59\%, and 11.82\%, respectively, while achieving comparable or better performance compared to the baseline. We also demonstrate that SAFE induces regularization effect, thereby smoothing the loss landscape.</description>

      <title>CovidLLM: A Robust Large Language Model with Missing Value Adaptation and Multi-Objective Learning Strategy for Predicting Disease Severity and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged in 2019, has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Although effective vaccines have been developed to mitigate severe symptoms, certain populations, particularly the elderly and those with comorbidities, remain at high risk for severe outcomes and increased mortality. Consequently, early identification of the severity and clinical outcomes of the disease in these patients is vital to prevent adverse prognoses. Although traditional machine learning and deep learning models have been widely employed in this area, the potential of large language models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored. Our research focuses primarily on constructing specialized prompts and adopting multi-objective learning strategies. We started by selecting serological indicators that significantly correlate with clinical outcomes and disease severity to serve as input data for the model. Blood test samples often contain numerous missing values, and traditional models generally rely on imputation to handle these gaps in the data. In contrast, LLMs offer the advantage of robust semantic understanding. By setting prompts, we can explicitly inform the model when a feature's value is missing, without the need for imputation. For the multi-objective learning strategy, the model is designed to first predict disease severity and then predict clinical outcomes. Given that LLMs utilize both the input text and the generated tokens as input for generating the next token, the predicted severity is used as a basis for generating the clinical outcome. During the fine-tuning of the LLM, the two objectives influence and improve each other. Our experiments were implemented based on the ChatGLM model. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs in this task, suggesting promising potential for further development.</description>

      <title>BatchLLM: Optimizing Large Batched LLM Inference with Global Prefix Sharing and Throughput-oriented Token Batching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many LLM tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix. The KV context that is about to be reused may prematurely be evicted with the implicit cache management. Even if not evicted, the lifetime of the shared KV context is extended since requests sharing the same context are not scheduled together, resulting in larger memory usage. These streaming oriented systems schedule the requests in the first-come-first-serve or similar order. As a result, the requests with larger ratio of decoding steps may be scheduled too late to be able to mix with the prefill chunks to increase the hardware utilization. Besides, the token and request number based batching can limit the size of token-batch, which keeps the GPU from saturating for the iterations dominated by decoding tokens. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best, which also shrinks the lifetime of common KV memory. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM by 1.1x to 2x on a set of microbenchmarks and two typical industry workloads.</description>

      <title>The Vulnerability of Language Model Benchmarks: Do They Accurately Reflect True LLM Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of leaderboard rankings in Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a fundamental paradox: models excel at standardized tests while failing to demonstrate genuine language understanding and adaptability. Our systematic analysis of NLP evaluation frameworks reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across the evaluation spectrum, from basic metrics to complex benchmarks like GLUE and MMLU. These vulnerabilities manifest through benchmark exploitation, dataset contamination, and evaluation bias, creating a false perception of progress in language understanding capabilities. Through extensive review of contemporary evaluation approaches, we identify significant limitations in static benchmark designs, human evaluation protocols, and LLM-as-judge frameworks, all of which compromise the reliability of current performance assessments. As LLM capabilities evolve and existing benchmarks become redundant, we lay the groundwork for new evaluation methods that resist manipulation, minimize data contamination, and assess domain-specific tasks. This requires frameworks that are adapted dynamically, addressing current limitations and providing a more accurate reflection of LLM performance.</description>

      <title>CPTQuant -- A Novel Mixed Precision Post-Training Quantization Techniques for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have transformed the comprehension and generation of natural language tasks, but they come with substantial memory and computational requirements. Quantization techniques have emerged as a promising avenue for addressing these challenges while preserving accuracy and making energy efficient. We propose CPTQuant, a comprehensive strategy that introduces correlation-based (CMPQ), pruning-based (PMPQ), and Taylor decomposition-based (TDMPQ) mixed precision techniques. CMPQ adapts the precision level based on canonical correlation analysis of different layers. PMPQ optimizes precision layer-wise based on their sensitivity to sparsity. TDMPQ modifies precision using Taylor decomposition to assess each layer's sensitivity to input perturbation. These strategies allocate higher precision to more sensitive layers while diminishing precision to robust layers. CPTQuant assesses the performance across BERT, OPT-125M, OPT-350M, OPT-1.3B, and OPT-2.7B. We demonstrate up to 4x compression and a 2x-fold increase in efficiency with minimal accuracy drop compared to Hugging Face FP16. PMPQ stands out for achieving a considerably higher model compression. Sensitivity analyses across various LLMs show that the initial and final 30% of layers exhibit higher sensitivities than the remaining layers. PMPQ demonstrates an 11% higher compression ratio than other methods for classification tasks, while TDMPQ achieves a 30% greater compression ratio for language modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>Advanced Risk Prediction and Stability Assessment of Banks Using Time Series Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to study the prediction of the bank stability index based on the Time Series Transformer model. The bank stability index is an important indicator to measure the health status and risk resistance of financial institutions. Traditional prediction methods are difficult to adapt to complex market changes because they rely on single-dimensional macroeconomic data. This paper proposes a prediction framework based on the Time Series Transformer, which uses the self-attention mechanism of the model to capture the complex temporal dependencies and nonlinear relationships in financial data. Through experiments, we compare the model with LSTM, GRU, CNN, TCN and RNN-Transformer models. The experimental results show that the Time Series Transformer model outperforms other models in both mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) evaluation indicators, showing strong prediction ability. This shows that the Time Series Transformer model can better handle multidimensional time series data in bank stability prediction, providing new technical approaches and solutions for financial risk management.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics Data Analysis: Advances and Challenges from a Data Science Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized our capacity to investigate cellular properties, functions, and interactions in both cellular and spatial contexts. However, the analysis of single-cell and spatial omics data remains challenging. First, single-cell sequencing data are high-dimensional and sparse, often contaminated by noise and uncertainty, obscuring the underlying biological signals. Second, these data often encompass multiple modalities, including gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and spatial locations. Integrating these diverse data modalities is crucial for enhancing prediction accuracy and biological interpretability. Third, while the scale of single-cell sequencing has expanded to millions of cells, high-quality annotated datasets are still limited. Fourth, the complex correlations of biological tissues make it difficult to accurately reconstruct cellular states and spatial contexts. Traditional feature engineering-based analysis methods struggle to deal with the various challenges presented by intricate biological networks. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool capable of handling high-dimensional complex data and automatically identifying meaningful patterns, offering significant promise in addressing these challenges. This review systematically analyzes these challenges and discusses related deep learning approaches. Moreover, we have curated 21 datasets from 9 benchmarks, encompassing 58 computational methods, and evaluated their performance on the respective modeling tasks. Finally, we highlight three areas for future development from a technical, dataset, and application perspective. This work will serve as a valuable resource for understanding how deep learning can be effectively utilized in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses, while inspiring novel approaches to address emerging challenges.</description>

      <title>How to Correctly do Semantic Backpropagation on Language-based Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language-based agentic systems have shown great promise in recent years, transitioning from solving small-scale research problems to being deployed in challenging real-world tasks. However, optimizing these systems often requires substantial manual labor. Recent studies have demonstrated that these systems can be represented as computational graphs, enabling automatic optimization. Despite these advancements, most current efforts in Graph-based Agentic System Optimization (GASO) fail to properly assign feedback to the system's components given feedback on the system's output. To address this challenge, we formalize the concept of semantic backpropagation with semantic gradients -- a generalization that aligns several key optimization techniques, including reverse-mode automatic differentiation and the more recent TextGrad by exploiting the relationship among nodes with a common successor. This serves as a method for computing directional information about how changes to each component of an agentic system might improve the system's output. To use these gradients, we propose a method called semantic gradient descent which enables us to solve GASO effectively. Our results on both BIG-Bench Hard and GSM8K show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for solving GASO problems. A detailed ablation study on the LIAR dataset demonstrates the parsimonious nature of our method.

      <title>Evaluating Single Event Upsets in Deep Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation: an embedded system perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the deployment of artifical intelligence (AI) algorithms at edge devices becomes increasingly prevalent, enhancing the robustness and reliability of autonomous AI-based perception and decision systems is becoming as relevant as precision and performance, especially in applications areas considered safety-critical such as autonomous driving and aerospace. This paper delves into the robustness assessment in embedded Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly focusing on the impact of parameter perturbations produced by single event upsets (SEUs) on convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image semantic segmentation. By scrutinizing the layer-by-layer and bit-by-bit sensitivity of various encoder-decoder models to soft errors, this study thoroughly investigates the vulnerability of segmentation DNNs to SEUs and evaluates the consequences of techniques like model pruning and parameter quantization on the robustness of compressed models aimed at embedded implementations. The findings offer valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying SEU-induced failures that allow for evaluating the robustness of DNNs once trained in advance. Moreover, based on the collected data, we propose a set of practical lightweight error mitigation techniques with no memory or computational cost suitable for resource-constrained deployments. The code used to perform the fault injection (FI) campaign is available at https://github.com/jonGuti13/TensorFI2 , while the code to implement proposed techniques is available at https://github.com/jonGuti13/parameterProtection .</description>

      <title>Explainable Malware Detection through Integrated Graph Reduction and Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control Flow Graphs and Function Call Graphs have become pivotal in providing a detailed understanding of program execution and effectively characterizing the behavior of malware. These graph-based representations, when combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNN), have shown promise in developing high-performance malware detectors. However, challenges remain due to the large size of these graphs and the inherent opacity in the decision-making process of GNNs. This paper addresses these issues by developing several graph reduction techniques to reduce graph size and applying the state-of-the-art GNNExplainer to enhance the interpretability of GNN outputs. The analysis demonstrates that integrating our proposed graph reduction technique along with GNNExplainer in the malware detection framework significantly reduces graph size while preserving high performance, providing an effective balance between efficiency and transparency in malware detection.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Transformers for Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms, particularly attention-based transformer models, have become indispensable for analyzing the vast data generated by particle physics experiments like ATLAS and CMS at the CERN LHC. Particle Transformer (ParT), a state-of-the-art model, leverages particle-level attention to improve jet-tagging tasks, which are critical for identifying particles resulting from proton collisions. This study focuses on interpreting ParT by analyzing attention heat maps and particle-pair correlations on the $\eta$-$\phi$ plane, revealing a binary attention pattern where each particle attends to at most one other particle. At the same time, we observe that ParT shows varying focus on important particles and subjets depending on decay, indicating that the model learns traditional jet substructure observables. These insights enhance our understanding of the model's internal workings and learning process, offering potential avenues for improving the efficiency of transformer architectures in future high-energy physics applications.</description>

      <title>JPC: Flexible Inference for Predictive Coding Networks in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce JPC, a JAX library for training neural networks with Predictive Coding. JPC provides a simple, fast and flexible interface to train a variety of PC networks (PCNs) including discriminative, generative and hybrid models. Unlike existing libraries, JPC leverages ordinary differential equation solvers to integrate the gradient flow inference dynamics of PCNs. We find that a second-order solver achieves significantly faster runtimes compared to standard Euler integration, with comparable performance on a range of tasks and network depths. JPC also provides some theoretical tools that can be used to study PCNs. We hope that JPC will facilitate future research of PC. The code is available at https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Linear Regression with Linearly Dependent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the asymptotics of linear regression in settings where the covariates exhibit a linear dependency structure, departing from the standard assumption of independence. We model the covariates using stochastic processes with spatio-temporal covariance and analyze the performance of ridge regression in the high-dimensional proportional regime, where the number of samples and feature dimensions grow proportionally. A Gaussian universality theorem is proven, demonstrating that the asymptotics are invariant under replacing the covariates with Gaussian vectors preserving mean and covariance. Next, leveraging tools from random matrix theory, we derive precise characterizations of the estimation error. The estimation error is characterized by a fixed-point equation involving the spectral properties of the spatio-temporal covariance matrices, enabling efficient computation. We then study optimal regularization, overparameterization, and the double descent phenomenon in the context of dependent data. Simulations validate our theoretical predictions, shedding light on how dependencies influence estimation error and the choice of regularization parameters.</description>

      <title>Scaling Inference-Time Search with Vision Value Model for Improved Visual Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), there lacks effective approaches to enhance response quality by scaling inference-time computation. This capability is known to be a core step towards the self-improving models in recent large language model studies. In this paper, we present Vision Value Model (VisVM) that can guide VLM inference-time search to generate responses with better visual comprehension. Specifically, VisVM not only evaluates the generated sentence quality in the current search step, but also anticipates the quality of subsequent sentences that may result from the current step, thus providing a long-term value. In this way, VisVM steers VLMs away from generating sentences prone to hallucinations or insufficient detail, thereby producing higher quality responses. Experimental results demonstrate that VisVM-guided search significantly enhances VLMs' ability to generate descriptive captions with richer visual details and fewer hallucinations, compared with greedy decoding and search methods with other visual reward signals. Furthermore, we find that self-training the model with the VisVM-guided captions improve VLM's performance across a wide range of multimodal benchmarks, indicating the potential for developing self-improving VLMs. Our value model and code are available at https://github.com/si0wang/VisVM.</description>

Abstract: The paper considers a Constrained-Informed Neural Network (CINN) approximation for the Time Shift Governor (TSG), which is an add-on scheme to the nominal closed-loop system used to enforce constraints by time-shifting the reference trajectory in spacecraft rendezvous applications. We incorporate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), an emerging architecture in the AI community, as a fundamental component of CINN and propose a Constrained-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CIKAN)-based approximation for TSG. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CIKAN-based TSG through simulations of constrained spacecraft rendezvous missions on highly elliptic orbits and present comparisons between CIKANs, MLP-based CINNs, and the conventional TSG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a novel mathematical optimization based methodology to perturb the features of a given observation to be re-classified, by a tree ensemble classification rule, to a certain desired class. The method is based on these facts: the most viable changes for an observation to reach the desired class do not always coincide with the closest distance point (in the feature space) of the target class; individuals put effort on a few number of features to reach the desired class; and each individual is endowed with a probability to change each of its features to a given value, which determines the overall probability of changing to the target class. Putting all together, we provide different methods to find the features where the individuals must exert effort to maximize the probability to reach the target class. Our method also allows us to rank the most important features in the tree-ensemble. The proposed methodology is tested on a real dataset, validating the proposal.</description>

      <title>Deep Variational Bayesian Modeling of Haze Degradation Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relying on the representation power of neural networks, most recent works have often neglected several factors involved in haze degradation, such as transmission (the amount of light reaching an observer from a scene over distance) and atmospheric light. These factors are generally unknown, making dehazing problems ill-posed and creating inherent uncertainties. To account for such uncertainties and factors involved in haze degradation, we introduce a variational Bayesian framework for single image dehazing. We propose to take not only a clean image and but also transmission map as latent variables, the posterior distributions of which are parameterized by corresponding neural networks: dehazing and transmission networks, respectively. Based on a physical model for haze degradation, our variational Bayesian framework leads to a new objective function that encourages the cooperation between them, facilitating the joint training of and thereby boosting the performance of each other. In our framework, a dehazing network can estimate a clean image independently of a transmission map estimation during inference, introducing no overhead. Furthermore, our model-agnostic framework can be seamlessly incorporated with other existing dehazing networks, greatly enhancing the performance consistently across datasets and models.</description>

      <title>End to End Collaborative Synthetic Data Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of AI is based on the availability of data to train models. While in some cases a single data custodian may have sufficient data to enable AI, often multiple custodians need to collaborate to reach a cumulative size required for meaningful AI research. The latter is, for example, often the case for rare diseases, with each clinical site having data for only a small number of patients. Recent algorithms for federated synthetic data generation are an important step towards collaborative, privacy-preserving data sharing. Existing techniques, however, focus exclusively on synthesizer training, assuming that the training data is already preprocessed and that the desired synthetic data can be delivered in one shot, without any hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end collaborative framework for publishing of synthetic data that accounts for privacy-preserving preprocessing as well as evaluation. We instantiate this framework with Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocols and evaluate it in a use case for privacy-preserving publishing of synthetic genomic data for leukemia.</description>

      <title>Learning Networks from Wide-Sense Stationary Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex networked systems driven by latent inputs are common in fields like neuroscience, finance, and engineering. A key inference problem here is to learn edge connectivity from node outputs (potentials). We focus on systems governed by steady-state linear conservation laws: $X_t = {L^{\ast}}Y_{t}$, where $X_t, Y_t \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denote inputs and potentials, respectively, and the sparsity pattern of the $p \times p$ Laplacian $L^{\ast}$ encodes the edge structure. Assuming $X_t$ to be a wide-sense stationary stochastic process with a known spectral density matrix, we learn the support of $L^{\ast}$ from temporally correlated samples of $Y_t$ via an $\ell_1$-regularized Whittle's maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The regularization is particularly useful for learning large-scale networks in the high-dimensional setting where the network size $p$ significantly exceeds the number of samples $n$.
  We show that the MLE problem is strictly convex, admitting a unique solution. Under a novel mutual incoherence condition and certain sufficient conditions on $(n, p, d)$, we show that the ML estimate recovers the sparsity pattern of $L^\ast$ with high probability, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph underlying $L^{\ast}$. We provide recovery guarantees for $L^\ast$ in element-wise maximum, Frobenius, and operator norms. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with several simulation studies on synthetic and benchmark datasets, including engineered systems (power and water networks), and real-world datasets from neural systems (such as the human brain).</description>

      <title>Diffusion in Zero-Shot Learning for Environmental Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot learning enables models to generalize to unseen classes by leveraging semantic information, bridging the gap between training and testing sets with non-overlapping classes. While much research has focused on zero-shot learning in computer vision, the application of these methods to environmental audio remains underexplored, with poor performance in existing studies. Generative methods, which have demonstrated success in computer vision, are notably absent from environmental audio zero-shot learning, where classification-based approaches dominate.
  To address this gap, this work investigates generative methods for zero-shot learning in environmental audio. Two successful generative models from computer vision are adapted: a cross-aligned and distribution-aligned variational autoencoder (CADA-VAE) and a leveraging invariant side generative adversarial network (LisGAN). Additionally, a novel diffusion model conditioned on class auxiliary data is introduced. The diffusion model generates synthetic data for unseen classes, which is combined with seen-class data to train a classifier.
  Experiments are conducted on two environmental audio datasets, ESC-50 and FSC22. Results show that the diffusion model significantly outperforms all baseline methods, achieving more than 25% higher accuracy on the ESC-50 test partition.
  This work establishes the diffusion model as a promising generative approach for zero-shot learning and introduces the first benchmark of generative methods for environmental audio zero-shot learning, providing a foundation for future research in the field.

Abstract: Retractions play a vital role in maintaining scientific integrity, yet systematic studies of retractions in computer science and other STEM fields remain scarce. We present WithdrarXiv, the first large-scale dataset of withdrawn papers from arXiv, containing over 14,000 papers and their associated retraction comments spanning the repository's entire history through September 2024. Through careful analysis of author comments, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of retraction reasons, identifying 10 distinct categories ranging from critical errors to policy violations. We demonstrate a simple yet highly accurate zero-shot automatic categorization of retraction reasons, achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.96. Additionally, we release WithdrarXiv-SciFy, an enriched version including scripts for parsed full-text PDFs, specifically designed to enable research in scientific feasibility studies, claim verification, and automated theorem proving. These findings provide valuable insights for improving scientific quality control and automated verification systems. Finally, and most importantly, we discuss ethical issues and take a number of steps to implement responsible data release while fostering open science in this area.</description>

      <title>Community Detection with Heterogeneous Block Covariance Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is the task of clustering objects based on their pairwise relationships. Most of the model-based community detection methods, such as the stochastic block model and its variants, are designed for networks with binary (yes/no) edges. In many practical scenarios, edges often possess continuous weights, spanning positive and negative values, which reflect varying levels of connectivity. To address this challenge, we introduce the heterogeneous block covariance model (HBCM) that defines a community structure within the covariance matrix, where edges have signed and continuous weights. Furthermore, it takes into account the heterogeneity of objects when forming connections with other objects within a community. A novel variational expectation-maximization algorithm is proposed to estimate the group membership. The HBCM provides provable consistent estimates of memberships, and its promising performance is observed in numerical simulations with different setups. The model is applied to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of a mouse embryo and a stock price dataset. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.</description>

      <title>The broader spectrum of in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit $\unicode{x2014}$ such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.</description>

      <title>Samudra: An AI Global Ocean Emulator for Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI emulators for forecasting have emerged as powerful tools that can outperform conventional numerical predictions. The next frontier is to build emulators for long-term climate projections with robust skill across a wide range of spatiotemporal scales, a particularly important goal for the ocean. Our work builds a skillful global emulator of the ocean component of a state-of-the-art climate model. We emulate key ocean variables, sea surface height, horizontal velocities, temperature, and salinity, across their full depth. We use a modified ConvNeXt UNet architecture trained on multidepth levels of ocean data. We show that the ocean emulator - Samudra - which exhibits no drift relative to the truth, can reproduce the depth structure of ocean variables and their interannual variability. Samudra is stable for centuries and 150 times faster than the original ocean model. Samudra struggles to capture the correct magnitude of the forcing trends and simultaneously remains stable, requiring further work.</description>

      <title>Synergizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs: A Novel Approach to Software Repository-Related Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software repositories contain valuable information for gaining insights into their development process. However, extracting insights from these repository data is time-consuming and requires technical expertise. While software engineering chatbots have been developed to facilitate natural language interactions with repositories, they struggle with understanding natural language and accurately retrieving relevant data. This study aims to improve the accuracy of LLM-based chatbots in answering repository-related questions by augmenting them with knowledge graphs. We achieve this in a two-step approach; (1) constructing a knowledge graph from the repository data and (2) synergizing the knowledge graph with LLM to allow for the natural language questions and answers. We curated a set of 20 questions with different complexities and evaluated our approach on five popular open-source projects. Our approach achieved an accuracy of 65%. We further investigated the limitations and identified six key issues, with the majority relating to the reasoning capability of the LLM. We experimented with a few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to determine if it could enhance our approach. This technique improved the overall accuracy to 84%. Our findings demonstrate the synergy between LLMs and knowledge graphs as a viable solution for making repository data accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of boosted and resolved multi-Higgs-boson events with symmetry-preserving attention networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of multiple Higgs bosons at the CERN LHC provides a direct way to measure the trilinear and quartic Higgs self-interaction strengths as well as potential access to beyond the standard model effects that can enhance production at large transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The largest event fraction arises from the fully hadronic final state in which every Higgs boson decays to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($b\bar{b}$). This introduces a combinatorial challenge known as the \emph{jet assignment problem}: assigning jets to sets representing Higgs boson candidates. Symmetry-preserving attention networks (SPA-Nets) have been been developed to address this challenge. However, the complexity of jet assignment increases when simultaneously considering both $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ reconstruction possibilities, i.e., two "resolved" small-radius jets each containing a shower initiated by a $b$-quark or one "boosted" large-radius jet containing a merged shower initiated by a $b\bar{b}$ pair. The latter improves the reconstruction efficiency at high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. In this work, we introduce a generalization to the SPA-Net approach to simultaneously consider both boosted and resolved reconstruction possibilities and unambiguously interpret an event as "fully resolved'', "fully boosted", or in between. We report the performance of baseline methods, the original SPA-Net approach, and our generalized version on nonresonant $HH$ and $HHH$ production at the LHC. Considering both boosted and resolved topologies, our SPA-Net approach increases the Higgs boson reconstruction purity by 57--62\% and the efficiency by 23--38\% compared to the baseline method depending on the final state.</description>

      <title>A Noise is Worth Diffusion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel in generating high-quality images. However, current diffusion models struggle to produce reliable images without guidance methods, such as classifier-free guidance (CFG). Are guidance methods truly necessary? Observing that noise obtained via diffusion inversion can reconstruct high-quality images without guidance, we focus on the initial noise of the denoising pipeline. By mapping Gaussian noise to `guidance-free noise', we uncover that small low-magnitude low-frequency components significantly enhance the denoising process, removing the need for guidance and thus improving both inference throughput and memory. Expanding on this, we propose \ours, a novel method that replaces guidance methods with a single refinement of the initial noise. This refined noise enables high-quality image generation without guidance, within the same diffusion pipeline. Our noise-refining model leverages efficient noise-space learning, achieving rapid convergence and strong performance with just 50K text-image pairs. We validate its effectiveness across diverse metrics and analyze how refined noise can eliminate the need for guidance. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/NoiseRefine/.</description>

      <title>Multisource Collaborative Domain Generalization for Cross-Scene Remote Sensing Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-scene image classification aims to transfer prior knowledge of ground materials to annotate regions with different distributions and reduce hand-crafted cost in the field of remote sensing. However, existing approaches focus on single-source domain generalization to unseen target domains, and are easily confused by large real-world domain shifts due to the limited training information and insufficient diversity modeling capacity. To address this gap, we propose a novel multi-source collaborative domain generalization framework (MS-CDG) based on homogeneity and heterogeneity characteristics of multi-source remote sensing data, which considers data-aware adversarial augmentation and model-aware multi-level diversification simultaneously to enhance cross-scene generalization performance. The data-aware adversarial augmentation adopts an adversary neural network with semantic guide to generate MS samples by adaptively learning realistic channel and distribution changes across domains. In views of cross-domain and intra-domain modeling, the model-aware diversification transforms the shared spatial-channel features of MS data into the class-wise prototype and kernel mixture module, to address domain discrepancies and cluster different classes effectively. Finally, the joint classification of original and augmented MS samples is employed by introducing a distribution consistency alignment to increase model diversity and ensure better domain-invariant representation learning. Extensive experiments on three public MS remote sensing datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method when benchmarked with the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MISR: Measuring Instrumental Self-Reasoning in Frontier Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a suite of tasks to evaluate the instrumental self-reasoning ability of large language model (LLM) agents. Instrumental self-reasoning ability could improve adaptability and enable self-modification, but it could also pose significant risks, such as enabling deceptive alignment. Prior work has only evaluated self-reasoning in non-agentic settings or in limited domains. In this paper, we propose evaluations for instrumental self-reasoning ability in agentic tasks in a wide range of scenarios, including self-modification, knowledge seeking, and opaque self-reasoning. We evaluate agents built using state-of-the-art LLMs, including commercial and open source systems. We find that instrumental self-reasoning ability emerges only in the most capable frontier models and that it is highly context-dependent. No model passes the the most difficult versions of our evaluations, hence our evaluation can be used to measure increases in instrumental self-reasoning ability in future models. We open-source our evaluations at https://github.com/kaifronsdal/Self-Reasoning-Evals.</description>

      <title>Can Targeted Clean-Label Poisoning Attacks Generalize?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Targeted poisoning attacks aim to compromise the model's prediction on specific target samples. In a common clean-label setting, they are achieved by slightly perturbing a subset of training samples given access to those specific targets. Despite continuous efforts, it remains unexplored whether such attacks can generalize to unknown variations of those targets. In this paper, we take the first step to systematically study this generalization problem. Observing that the widely adopted, cosine similarity-based attack exhibits limited generalizability, we propose a well-generalizable attack that leverages both the direction and magnitude of model gradients. In particular, we explore diverse target variations, such as an object with varied viewpoints and an animal species with distinct appearances. Extensive experiments across various generalization scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently achieves the best attack effectiveness. For example, our method outperforms the cosine similarity-based attack by 20.95% in attack success rate with similar overall accuracy, averaged over four models on two image benchmark datasets.

      <title>Traffic Co-Simulation Framework Empowered by Infrastructure Camera Sensing and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic simulations are commonly used to optimize traffic flow, with reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic signal control. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents, trained with four different reward structures, leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in the test-bed demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions using real-time camera-based detection. The framework also evaluates the robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating adaptability for real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>MegaCOIN: Enhancing Medium-Grained Color Perception for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), the ability to perceive and interpret color and physical environment is crucial for achieving contextually accurate understanding and interaction. However, despite advances in multimodal modeling, there remains a significant lack of specialized datasets that rigorously evaluate a model's capacity to discern subtle color variations and spatial context -- critical elements for situational comprehension and reliable deployment across real-world applications. Toward that goal, we curate MegaCOIN, a high-quality, human-labeled dataset based on \emph{real} images with various contextual attributes. MegaCOIN consists of two parts: MegaCOIN-Instruct, which serves as a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset for VLMs; and MegaCOIN-Bench, an annotated test set that can be used as a stand-alone QA dataset. MegaCOIN~provides three annotated features for 220,000 real images: foreground color, background color, and description of an object's physical environment, constituting 660k human annotations. In addition, MegaCOIN can be applied to benchmark domain generalization (DG) algorithms. We explore benchmarking DG methods in the linear probing setup for VLM and show some new insights. Last but not least, we show that VLMs, including GPT-4o, have subpar color recognition capabilities, and fine-tuning with MegaCOIN can result in improved performance on visual evaluation tasks. In certain cases, MegaCOIN fine-tuned small-scale opensource models such as LLaVA and Bunny can outperform closed-source GPT-4o. We hope the utilities of MegaCOIN can shed light on the directions VLMs can improve and provide a more complex platform for domain generalization algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In image-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (MIS), understanding surgical scenes is vital for real-time feedback to surgeons, skill evaluation, and improving outcomes through collaborative human-robot procedures. Within this context, the challenge lies in accurately detecting, segmenting, and estimating the depth of surgical scenes depicted in high-resolution images, while simultaneously reconstructing the scene in 3D and providing segmentation of surgical instruments along with detection labels for each instrument. To address this challenge, a novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) network is proposed for performing these tasks concurrently. A key aspect of this approach involves overcoming the optimization hurdles associated with handling multiple tasks concurrently by integrating a Adversarial Weight Update into the MTL framework, the proposed MTL model achieves 3D reconstruction through the integration of segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, thereby enhancing the understanding of surgical scenes, which marks a significant advancement compared to existing studies that lack 3D capabilities. Comprehensive experiments on the EndoVis2018 benchmark dataset underscore the adeptness of the model in efficiently addressing all three tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the creation of powerful text generation models, such as large language models (LLMs), which are widely used for diverse applications. However, concerns surrounding AI-generated content, including issues of originality, bias, misinformation, and accountability, have become increasingly prominent. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of AI text generators (AITGs), focusing on their evolution, capabilities, and ethical implications. This paper also introduces Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a recent approach that improves the contextual relevance and accuracy of text generation by integrating dynamic information retrieval. RAG addresses key limitations of traditional models, including their reliance on static knowledge and potential inaccuracies in handling real-world data. Additionally, the paper reviews detection tools that help differentiate AI-generated text from human-written content and discusses the ethical challenges these technologies pose. The paper explores future directions for improving detection accuracy, supporting ethical AI development, and increasing accessibility. The paper contributes to a more responsible and reliable use of AI in content creation through these discussions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Modeling Method for RF Devices Based on Uniform Noise Training Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the scale and complexity of integrated circuits continue to increase, traditional modeling methods are struggling to address the nonlinear challenges in radio frequency (RF) chips. Deep learning has been increasingly applied to RF device modeling. This paper proposes a deep learning-based modeling method for RF devices using a uniform noise training set, aimed at modeling and fitting the nonlinear characteristics of RF devices. We hypothesize that a uniform noise signal can encompass the full range of characteristics across both frequency and amplitude, and that a deep learning model can effectively capture and learn these features. Based on this hypothesis, the paper designs a complete integrated circuit modeling process based on measured data, including data collection, processing, and neural network training. The proposed method is experimentally validated using the RF amplifier PW210 as a case study. Experimental results show that the uniform noise training set allows the model to capture the nonlinear characteristics of RF devices, and the trained model can predict waveform patterns it has never encountered before. The proposed deep learning-based RF device modeling method, using a uniform noise training set, demonstrates strong generalization capability and excellent training performance, offering high practical application value.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual models of human gait, or digital twins, offer a promising solution for studying mobility without the need for labor-intensive data collection. However, challenges such as the sim-to-real gap and limited adaptability to diverse walking conditions persist. To address these, we developed and validated a framework to create a skeletal humanoid agent capable of adapting to varying walking speeds while maintaining biomechanically realistic motions. The framework combines a synthetic data generator, which produces biomechanically plausible gait kinematics from open-source biomechanics data, and a training system that uses adversarial imitation learning to train the agent's walking policy. We conducted comprehensive analyses comparing the agent's kinematics, synthetic data, and the original biomechanics dataset. The agent achieved a root mean square error of 5.24 +- 0.09 degrees at varying speeds compared to ground-truth kinematics data, demonstrating its adaptability. This work represents a significant step toward developing a digital twin of human locomotion, with potential applications in biomechanics research, exoskeleton design, and rehabilitation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fully Convolutional Networks for the Segmentation of Hyperspectral Imaging Applied to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed with the main purpose of increasing the safety and comfort of vehicle occupants. Most of current computer vision-based ADAS perform detection and tracking tasks quite successfully under regular conditions, but are not completely reliable, particularly under adverse weather and changing lighting conditions, neither in complex situations with many overlapping objects. In this work we explore the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in ADAS on the assumption that the distinct near infrared (NIR) spectral reflectances of different materials can help to better separate the objects in a driving scene. In particular, this paper describes some experimental results of the application of fully convolutional networks (FCN) to the image segmentation of HSI for ADAS applications. More specifically, our aim is to investigate to what extent the spatial features codified by convolutional filters can be helpful to improve the performance of HSI segmentation systems. With that aim, we use the HSI-Drive v1.1 dataset, which provides a set of labelled images recorded in real driving conditions with a small-size snapshot NIR-HSI camera. Finally, we analyze the implementability of such a HSI segmentation system by prototyping the developed FCN model together with the necessary hyperspectral cube preprocessing stage and characterizing its performance on an MPSoC.</description>

      <title>Safe and Efficient Online Convex Optimization with Linear Budget Constraints and Partial Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies online convex optimization with unknown linear budget constraints, where only the gradient information of the objective and the bandit feedback of constraint functions are observed. We propose a safe and efficient Lyapunov-optimization algorithm (SELO) that can achieve an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and zero cumulative constraint violation. The result also implies SELO achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret when the budget is hard and not allowed to be violated. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient as it resembles a primal-dual algorithm where the primal problem is an unconstrained, strongly convex and smooth problem, and the dual problem has a simple gradient-type update. The algorithm and theory are further justified in a simulated application of energy-efficient task processing in distributed data centers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under a set of assumptions on a family of submanifolds $\subset {\mathbb R}^D$, we derive a series of geometric properties that remain valid after finite-dimensional and almost isometric Diffusion Maps (DM), including almost uniform density, finite polynomial approximation and local reach. Leveraging these properties, we establish rigorous bounds on the embedding errors introduced by the DM algorithm is $O\left((\frac{\log n}{n})^{\frac{1}{8d+16}}\right)$. These results offer a solid theoretical foundation for understanding the performance and reliability of DM in practical applications.</description>

      <title>LaserGuider: A Laser Based Physical Backdoor Attack against Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed hidden associations between triggers and targets in deep neural networks (DNNs), causing them to predict the target when a trigger is present while maintaining normal behavior otherwise. Physical backdoor attacks, which use physical objects as triggers, are feasible but lack remote control, temporal stealthiness, flexibility, and mobility. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a new type of backdoor triggers utilizing lasers that feature long-distance transmission and instant-imaging properties. Based on the laser-based backdoor triggers, we present a physical backdoor attack, called LaserGuider, which possesses remote control ability and achieves high temporal stealthiness, flexibility, and mobility. We also introduce a systematic approach to optimize laser parameters for improving attack effectiveness. Our evaluation on traffic sign recognition DNNs, critical in autonomous vehicles, demonstrates that LaserGuider with three different laser-based triggers achieves over 90% attack success rate with negligible impact on normal inputs. Additionally, we release LaserMark, the first dataset of real world traffic signs stamped with physical laser spots, to support further research in backdoor attacks and defenses.</description>

      <title>Blind Underwater Image Restoration using Co-Operational Regressor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of underwater environments is essential for applications such as biological research, archaeology, and infrastructure maintenanceHowever, underwater imaging is challenging due to the waters unique properties, including scattering, absorption, color distortion, and reduced visibility. To address such visual degradations, a variety of approaches have been proposed covering from basic signal processing methods to deep learning models; however, none of them has proven to be consistently successful. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model, Co-Operational Regressor Networks (CoRe-Nets), designed to achieve the best possible underwater image restoration. A CoRe-Net consists of two co-operating networks: the Apprentice Regressor (AR), responsible for image transformation, and the Master Regressor (MR), which evaluates the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the images generated by the AR and feeds it back to AR. CoRe-Nets are built on Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs), which offer a superior learning capability by modulating nonlinearity in kernel transformations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on the benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset. Leveraging the joint learning capabilities of the two cooperating networks, the proposed model achieves the state-of-art restoration performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and often presents such results that can even surpass the visual quality of the ground truth with a 2-pass application. Our results and the optimized PyTorch implementation of the proposed approach are now publicly shared on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A Note on Spectral Map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, transitions between states are often rare events due to energy barriers that exceed the thermal temperature. Because of their infrequent occurrence and the huge number of degrees of freedom in molecular systems, understanding the physical properties that drive rare events is immensely difficult. A common approach to this problem is to propose a collective variable (CV) that describes this process by a simplified representation. However, choosing CVs is not easy, as it often relies on physical intuition. Machine learning (ML) techniques provide a promising approach for effectively extracting optimal CVs from MD data. Here, we provide a note on a recent unsupervised ML method called spectral map, which constructs CVs by maximizing the timescale separation between slow and fast variables in the system.</description>

      <title>Pathwise optimization for bridge-type estimators and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse parametric models are of great interest in statistical learning and are often analyzed by means of regularized estimators. Pathwise methods allow to efficiently compute the full solution path for penalized estimators, for any possible value of the penalization parameter $\lambda$. In this paper we deal with the pathwise optimization for bridge-type problems; i.e. we are interested in the minimization of a loss function, such as negative log-likelihood or residual sum of squares, plus the sum of $\ell^q$ norms with $q\in(0,1]$ involving adpative coefficients. For some loss functions this regularization achieves asymptotically the oracle properties (such as the selection consistency). Nevertheless, since the objective function involves nonconvex and nondifferentiable terms, the minimization problem is computationally challenging.
  The aim of this paper is to apply some general algorithms, arising from nonconvex optimization theory, to compute efficiently the path solutions for the adaptive bridge estimator with multiple penalties. In particular, we take into account two different approaches: accelerated proximal gradient descent and blockwise alternating optimization. The convergence and the path consistency of these algorithms are discussed. In order to assess our methods, we apply these algorithms to the penalized estimation of diffusion processes observed at discrete times. This latter represents a recent research topic in the field of statistics for time-dependent data.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications for Low-Altitude Economy: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system for low-altitude economy (LAE), where a ground base station (GBS) provides communication and navigation services for authorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), while sensing the low-altitude airspace to monitor the unauthorized mobile target. The expected communication sum-rate over a given flight period is maximized by jointly optimizing the beamforming at the GBS and UAVs' trajectories, subject to the constraints on the average signal-to-noise ratio requirement for sensing, the flight mission and collision avoidance of UAVs, as well as the maximum transmit power at the GBS. Typically, this is a sequential decision-making problem with the given flight mission. Thus, we transform it to a specific Markov decision process (MDP) model called episode task. Based on this modeling, we propose a novel LAE-oriented ISAC scheme, referred to as Deep LAE-ISAC (DeepLSC), by leveraging the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. In DeepLSC, a reward function and a new action selection policy termed constrained noise-exploration policy are judiciously designed to fulfill various constraints. To enable efficient learning in episode tasks, we develop a hierarchical experience replay mechanism, where the gist is to employ all experiences generated within each episode to jointly train the neural network. Besides, to enhance the convergence speed of DeepLSC, a symmetric experience augmentation mechanism, which simultaneously permutes the indexes of all variables to enrich available experience sets, is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with benchmarks, DeepLSC yields a higher sum-rate while meeting the preset constraints, achieves faster convergence, and is more robust against different settings.</description>

      <title>HyperFLINT: Hypernetwork-based Flow Estimation and Temporal Interpolation for Scientific Ensemble Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present HyperFLINT (Hypernetwork-based FLow estimation and temporal INTerpolation), a novel deep learning-based approach for estimating flow fields, temporally interpolating scalar fields, and facilitating parameter space exploration in spatio-temporal scientific ensemble data. This work addresses the critical need to explicitly incorporate ensemble parameters into the learning process, as traditional methods often neglect these, limiting their ability to adapt to diverse simulation settings and provide meaningful insights into the data dynamics. HyperFLINT introduces a hypernetwork to account for simulation parameters, enabling it to generate accurate interpolations and flow fields for each timestep by dynamically adapting to varying conditions, thereby outperforming existing parameter-agnostic approaches. The architecture features modular neural blocks with convolutional and deconvolutional layers, supported by a hypernetwork that generates weights for the main network, allowing the model to better capture intricate simulation dynamics. A series of experiments demonstrates HyperFLINT's significantly improved performance in flow field estimation and temporal interpolation, as well as its potential in enabling parameter space exploration, offering valuable insights into complex scientific ensembles.</description>

      <title>Missing Melodies: AI Music Generation and its "Nearly" Complete Omission of the Global South</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have sparked renewed interest and expanded possibilities for music generation. However, the performance and versatility of these systems across musical genres are heavily influenced by the availability of training data. We conducted an extensive analysis of over one million hours of audio datasets used in AI music generation research and manually reviewed more than 200 papers from eleven prominent AI and music conferences and organizations (AAAI, ACM, EUSIPCO, EURASIP, ICASSP, ICML, IJCAI, ISMIR, NeurIPS, NIME, SMC) to identify a critical gap in the fair representation and inclusion of the musical genres of the Global South in AI research. Our findings reveal a stark imbalance: approximately 86% of the total dataset hours and over 93% of researchers focus primarily on music from the Global North. However, around 40% of these datasets include some form of non-Western music, genres from the Global South account for only 14.6% of the data. Furthermore, approximately 51% of the papers surveyed concentrate on symbolic music generation, a method that often fails to capture the cultural nuances inherent in music from regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As AI increasingly shapes the creation and dissemination of music, the significant underrepresentation of music genres in datasets and research presents a serious threat to global musical diversity. We also propose some important steps to mitigate these risks and foster a more inclusive future for AI-driven music generation.</description>

      <title>Text Change Detection in Multilingual Documents Using Image Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document comparison typically relies on optical character recognition (OCR) as its core technology. However, OCR requires the selection of appropriate language models for each document and the performance of multilingual or hybrid models remains limited. To overcome these challenges, we propose text change detection (TCD) using an image comparison model tailored for multilingual documents. Unlike OCR-based approaches, our method employs word-level text image-to-image comparison to detect changes. Our model generates bidirectional change segmentation maps between the source and target documents. To enhance performance without requiring explicit text alignment or scaling preprocessing, we employ correlations among multi-scale attention features. We also construct a benchmark dataset comprising actual printed and scanned word pairs in various languages to evaluate our model. We validate our approach using our benchmark dataset and public benchmarks Distorted Document Images and the LRDE Document Binarization Dataset. We compare our model against state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and change detection models, as well as to conventional OCR-based models.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of least squares parameter estimation from single-trajectory data for discrete-time, unstable, closed-loop nonlinear stochastic systems, with linearly parameterised uncertainty. Assuming a region of the state space produces informative data, and the system is sub-exponentially unstable, we establish non-asymptotic guarantees on the estimation error at times where the state trajectory evolves in this region. If the whole state space is informative, high probability guarantees on the error hold for all times. Examples are provided where our results are useful for analysis, but existing results are not.</description>

      <title>On the Lack of Robustness of Binary Function Similarity Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary function similarity, which often relies on learning-based algorithms to identify what functions in a pool are most similar to a given query function, is a sought-after topic in different communities, including machine learning, software engineering, and security. Its importance stems from the impact it has in facilitating several crucial tasks, from reverse engineering and malware analysis to automated vulnerability detection. Whereas recent work cast light around performance on this long-studied problem, the research landscape remains largely lackluster in understanding the resiliency of the state-of-the-art machine learning models against adversarial attacks. As security requires to reason about adversaries, in this work we assess the robustness of such models through a simple yet effective black-box greedy attack, which modifies the topology and the content of the control flow of the attacked functions. We demonstrate that this attack is successful in compromising all the models, achieving average attack success rates of 57.06% and 95.81% depending on the problem settings (targeted and untargeted attacks). Our findings are insightful: top performance on clean data does not necessarily relate to top robustness properties, which explicitly highlights performance-robustness trade-offs one should consider when deploying such models, calling for further research.</description>

Abstract: Privacy-Preserving Record linkage (PPRL) is an essential component in data integration tasks of sensitive information. The linkage quality determines the usability of combined datasets and (machine learning) applications based on them. We present a novel privacy-preserving protocol that integrates clerical review in PPRL using a multi-layer active learning process. Uncertain match candidates are reviewed on several layers by human and non-human oracles to reduce the amount of disclosed information per record and in total. Predictions are propagated back to update previous layers, resulting in an improved linkage performance for non-reviewed candidates as well. The data owners remain in control of the amount of information they share for each record. Therefore, our approach follows need-to-know and data sovereignty principles. The experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows considerable linkage quality improvements with limited labeling effort and privacy risks.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Limits of Segment Anything Model: Analyzing Challenges in Segmenting Tree-Like and Low-Contrast Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown impressive performance in interactive and zero-shot segmentation across diverse domains, suggesting that they have learned a general concept of "objects" from their large-scale training. However, we observed that SAM struggles with certain types of objects, particularly those featuring dense, tree-like structures and low textural contrast from their surroundings. These failure modes are critical for understanding its limitations in real-world use. In order to systematically examine this issue, we propose metrics to quantify two key object characteristics: tree-likeness and textural separability. Through extensive controlled synthetic experiments and testing on real datasets, we demonstrate that SAM's performance is noticeably correlated with these factors. We link these behaviors under the concept of "textural confusion", where SAM misinterprets local structure as global texture, leading to over-segmentation, or struggles to differentiate objects from similarly textured backgrounds. These findings offer the first quantitative framework to model SAM's challenges, providing valuable insights into its limitations and guiding future improvements for vision foundation models.</description>

      <title>SCADE: Scalable Command-line Anomaly Detection Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As command-line interfaces remain an integral part of high-computation environments, the risk of exploitation through stealthy, complex command-line abuse continues to grow. Conventional security solutions often struggle with these command-line-based anomalies due to their context-specific nature and lack of labeled data, especially in detecting rare, malicious patterns amidst legitimate, high-volume activity. This gap has left organizations vulnerable to sophisticated threats like Living-off-the-Land (LOL) attacks, where standard detection tools frequently miss or misclassify anomalous command-line behavior. We introduce Scalable Command-Line Anomaly Detection Engine (SCADE), who addresses these challenges by introducing a dual-layered detection framework that combines a global statistical analysis with local context-specific anomaly detection, innovatively using a novel ensemble of statistical models such as BM25 and Log Entropy, adapted for command-line data. The framework also features a dynamic thresholding mechanism for adaptive anomaly detection, ensuring high precision and recall even in environments with extremely high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Initial experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving above 98% SNR in identifying unusual command-line behavior while minimizing false positives. In this paper, we present SCADE's core architecture, including its metadata-enriched approach to anomaly detection and the design choices behind its scalability for enterprise-level deployment. We argue that SCADE represents a significant advancement in command-line anomaly detection, offering a robust, adaptive framework for security analysts and researchers seeking to enhance detection accuracy in high-computation environments.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning from Wild Animal Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to learn legged robot locomotion skills by watching thousands of wild animal videos from the internet, such as those featured in nature documentaries. Indeed, such videos offer a rich and diverse collection of plausible motion examples, which could inform how robots should move. To achieve this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Wild Animal Videos (RLWAV), a method to ground these motions into physical robots. We first train a video classifier on a large-scale animal video dataset to recognize actions from RGB clips of animals in their natural habitats. We then train a multi-skill policy to control a robot in a physics simulator, using the classification score of a third-person camera capturing videos of the robot's movements as a reward for reinforcement learning. Finally, we directly transfer the learned policy to a real quadruped Solo. Remarkably, despite the extreme gap in both domain and embodiment between animals in the wild and robots, our approach enables the policy to learn diverse skills such as walking, jumping, and keeping still, without relying on reference trajectories nor skill-specific rewards.</description>

      <title>Structure-Aware Stylized Image Synthesis for Robust Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for effective diagnosis and treatment planning but is often challenged by domain shifts caused by variations in imaging devices, acquisition conditions, and patient-specific attributes. Traditional domain generalization methods typically require inclusion of parts of the test domain within the training set, which is not always feasible in clinical settings with limited diverse data. Additionally, although diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in image generation and style transfer, they often fail to preserve the critical structural information necessary for precise medical analysis. To address these issues, we propose a novel medical image segmentation method that combines diffusion models and Structure-Preserving Network for structure-aware one-shot image stylization. Our approach effectively mitigates domain shifts by transforming images from various sources into a consistent style while maintaining the location, size, and shape of lesions. This ensures robust and accurate segmentation even when the target domain is absent from the training data. Experimental evaluations on colonoscopy polyp segmentation and skin lesion segmentation datasets show that our method enhances the robustness and accuracy of segmentation models, achieving superior performance metrics compared to baseline models without style transfer. This structure-aware stylization framework offers a practical solution for improving medical image segmentation across diverse domains, facilitating more reliable clinical diagnoses.</description>

      <title>ALMA: Alignment with Minimal Annotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent approaches to large language model (LLM) alignment typically require millions of human annotations or rely on external aligned models for synthetic data generation. This paper introduces ALMA: Alignment with Minimal Annotation, demonstrating that effective alignment can be achieved using only 9,000 labeled examples -- less than 1% of conventional approaches. ALMA generates large amounts of high-quality synthetic alignment data through new techniques: diverse prompt synthesis via few-shot learning, diverse response generation with multiple model checkpoints, and judge (reward model) enhancement through score aggregation and self-distillation. Using only a pretrained Llama3 base model, 5,000 SFT examples, and 4,000 judge annotations, ALMA achieves performance close to Llama3-Instruct across diverse alignment benchmarks (e.g., 0.1% difference on AlpacaEval 2.0 score). These results are achieved with a multi-round, self-bootstrapped data synthesis and training recipe that continues to improve for 10 rounds, surpassing the typical 3-round ceiling of previous methods. These results suggest that base models already possess sufficient knowledge for effective alignment, and that synthetic data generation methods can expose it.</description>

      <title>The Tile: A 2D Map of Ranking Scores for Two-Class Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the computer vision and machine learning communities, as well as in many other research domains, rigorous evaluation of any new method, including classifiers, is essential. One key component of the evaluation process is the ability to compare and rank methods. However, ranking classifiers and accurately comparing their performances, especially when taking application-specific preferences into account, remains challenging. For instance, commonly used evaluation tools like Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision/Recall (PR) spaces display performances based on two scores. Hence, they are inherently limited in their ability to compare classifiers across a broader range of scores and lack the capability to establish a clear ranking among classifiers. In this paper, we present a novel versatile tool, named the Tile, that organizes an infinity of ranking scores in a single 2D map for two-class classifiers, including common evaluation scores such as the accuracy, the true positive rate, the positive predictive value, Jaccard's coefficient, and all F-beta scores. Furthermore, we study the properties of the underlying ranking scores, such as the influence of the priors or the correspondences with the ROC space, and depict how to characterize any other score by comparing them to the Tile. Overall, we demonstrate that the Tile is a powerful tool that effectively captures all the rankings in a single visualization and allows interpreting them.</description>

      <title>Generative-Model-Based Fully 3D PET Image Reconstruction by Conditional Diffusion Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently shown promising results for image reconstruction on simulated positron emission tomography (PET) datasets. In this work we have developed and implemented practical methodology for 3D image reconstruction with SGMs, and perform (to our knowledge) the first SGM-based reconstruction of real fully 3D PET data. We train an SGM on full-count reference brain images, and extend methodology to allow SGM-based reconstructions at very low counts (1% of original, to simulate low-dose or short-duration scanning). We then perform reconstructions for multiple independent realisations of 1% count data, allowing us to analyse the bias and variance characteristics of the method. We sample from the learned posterior distribution of the generative algorithm to calculate uncertainty images for our reconstructions. We evaluate the method's performance on real full- and low-count PET data and compare with conventional OSEM and MAP-EM baselines, showing that our SGM-based low-count reconstructions match full-dose reconstructions more closely and in a bias-variance trade-off comparison, our SGM-reconstructed images have lower variance than existing baselines. Future work will compare to supervised deep-learned methods, with other avenues for investigation including how data conditioning affects the SGM's posterior distribution and the algorithm's performance with different tracers.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Scheduled Score-Based Generative Modeling for Fully 3D PET Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image reconstruction with pre-trained score-based generative models (SGMs) has advantages over other existing state-of-the-art deep-learned reconstruction methods, including improved resilience to different scanner setups and advanced image distribution modeling. SGM-based reconstruction has recently been applied to simulated positron emission tomography (PET) datasets, showing improved contrast recovery for out-of-distribution lesions relative to the state-of-the-art. However, existing methods for SGM-based reconstruction from PET data suffer from slow reconstruction, burdensome hyperparameter tuning and slice inconsistency effects (in 3D). In this work, we propose a practical methodology for fully 3D reconstruction that accelerates reconstruction and reduces the number of critical hyperparameters by matching the likelihood of an SGM's reverse diffusion process to a current iterate of the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization algorithm. Using the example of low-count reconstruction from simulated $[^{18}$F]DPA-714 datasets, we show our methodology can match or improve on the NRMSE and SSIM of existing state-of-the-art SGM-based PET reconstruction while reducing reconstruction time and the need for hyperparameter tuning. We evaluate our methodology against state-of-the-art supervised and conventional reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate a first-ever implementation of SGM-based reconstruction for real 3D PET data, specifically $[^{18}$F]DPA-714 data, where we integrate perpendicular pre-trained SGMs to eliminate slice inconsistency issues.</description>

      <title>ActFusion: a Unified Diffusion Model for Action Segmentation and Anticipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal action segmentation and long-term action anticipation are two popular vision tasks for the temporal analysis of actions in videos. Despite apparent relevance and potential complementarity, these two problems have been investigated as separate and distinct tasks. In this work, we tackle these two problems, action segmentation and action anticipation, jointly using a unified diffusion model dubbed ActFusion. The key idea to unification is to train the model to effectively handle both visible and invisible parts of the sequence in an integrated manner; the visible part is for temporal segmentation, and the invisible part is for future anticipation. To this end, we introduce a new anticipative masking strategy during training in which a late part of the video frames is masked as invisible, and learnable tokens replace these frames to learn to predict the invisible future. Experimental results demonstrate the bi-directional benefits between action segmentation and anticipation. ActFusion achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the standard benchmarks of 50 Salads, Breakfast, and GTEA, outperforming task-specific models in both of the two tasks with a single unified model through joint learning.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Node Embeddings for Graph Modeling and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lying at the interface between Network Science and Machine Learning, node embedding algorithms take a graph as input and encode its structure onto output vectors that represent nodes in an abstract geometric space, enabling various vector-based downstream tasks such as network modelling, data compression, link prediction, and community detection. Two apparently unrelated limitations affect these algorithms. On one hand, it is not clear what the basic operation defining vector spaces, i.e. the vector sum, corresponds to in terms of the original nodes in the network. On the other hand, while the same input network can be represented at multiple levels of resolution by coarse-graining the constituent nodes into arbitrary block-nodes, the relationship between node embeddings obtained at different hierarchical levels is not understood. Here, building on recent results in network renormalization theory, we address these two limitations at once and define a multiscale node embedding method that, upon arbitrary coarse-grainings, ensures statistical consistency of the embedding vector of a block-node with the sum of the embedding vectors of its constituent nodes. We illustrate the power of this approach on two economic networks that can be naturally represented at multiple resolution levels: namely, the international trade between (sets of) countries and the input-output flows among (sets of) industries in the Netherlands. We confirm the statistical consistency between networks retrieved from coarse-grained node vectors and networks retrieved from sums of fine-grained node vectors, a result that cannot be achieved by alternative methods. Several key network properties, including a large number of triangles, are successfully replicated already from embeddings of very low dimensionality, allowing for the generation of faithful replicas of the original networks at arbitrary resolution levels.</description>

      <title>A Hitchhiker's Guide to Understanding Performances of Two-Class Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Properly understanding the performances of classifiers is essential in various scenarios. However, the literature often relies only on one or two standard scores to compare classifiers, which fails to capture the nuances of application-specific requirements, potentially leading to suboptimal classifier selection. Recently, a paper on the foundations of the theory of performance-based ranking introduced a tool, called the Tile, that organizes an infinity of ranking scores into a 2D map. Thanks to the Tile, it is now possible to evaluate and compare classifiers efficiently, displaying all possible application-specific preferences instead of having to rely on a pair of scores. In this paper, we provide a first hitchhiker's guide for understanding the performances of two-class classifiers by presenting four scenarios, each showcasing a different user profile: a theoretical analyst, a method designer, a benchmarker, and an application developer. Particularly, we show that we can provide different interpretative flavors that are adapted to the user's needs by mapping different values on the Tile. As an illustration, we leverage the newly introduced Tile tool and the different flavors to rank and analyze the performances of 74 state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models in two-class classification through the eyes of the four user profiles. Through these user profiles, we demonstrate that the Tile effectively captures the behavior of classifiers in a single visualization, while accommodating an infinite number of ranking scores.</description>

      <title>EmbodiedOcc: Embodied 3D Occupancy Prediction for Vision-based Online Scene Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction provides a comprehensive description of the surrounding scenes and has become an essential task for 3D perception. Most existing methods focus on offline perception from one or a few views and cannot be applied to embodied agents which demands to gradually perceive the scene through progressive embodied exploration. In this paper, we formulate an embodied 3D occupancy prediction task to target this practical scenario and propose a Gaussian-based EmbodiedOcc framework to accomplish it. We initialize the global scene with uniform 3D semantic Gaussians and progressively update local regions observed by the embodied agent. For each update, we extract semantic and structural features from the observed image and efficiently incorporate them via deformable cross-attention to refine the regional Gaussians. Finally, we employ Gaussian-to-voxel splatting to obtain the global 3D occupancy from the updated 3D Gaussians. Our EmbodiedOcc assumes an unknown (i.e., uniformly distributed) environment and maintains an explicit global memory of it with 3D Gaussians. It gradually gains knowledge through local refinement of regional Gaussians, which is consistent with how humans understand new scenes through embodied exploration. We reorganize an EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the embodied 3D occupancy prediction task. Experiments demonstrate that our EmbodiedOcc outperforms existing local prediction methods and accomplishes the embodied occupancy prediction with high accuracy and strong expandability. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YkiWu/EmbodiedOcc.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Gaussian Superposition for Efficient 3D Occupancy Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an important task for robust vision-centric autonomous driving, which predicts fine-grained geometry and semantics of the surrounding scene. Most existing methods leverage dense grid-based scene representations, overlooking the spatial sparsity of the driving scenes. Although 3D semantic Gaussian serves as an object-centric sparse alternative, most of the Gaussians still describe the empty region with low efficiency. To address this, we propose a probabilistic Gaussian superposition model which interprets each Gaussian as a probability distribution of its neighborhood being occupied and conforms to probabilistic multiplication to derive the overall geometry. Furthermore, we adopt the exact Gaussian mixture model for semantics calculation to avoid unnecessary overlapping of Gaussians. To effectively initialize Gaussians in non-empty region, we design a distribution-based initialization module which learns the pixel-aligned occupancy distribution instead of the depth of surfaces. We conduct extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets and our GaussianFormer-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

      <title>Providing Differential Privacy for Federated Learning Over Wireless: A Cross-layer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that inherently allows edge devices to maintain their local training data, thus providing some level of privacy. However, FL's model updates still pose a risk of privacy leakage, which must be mitigated. Over-the-air FL (OTA-FL) is an adapted FL design for wireless edge networks that leverages the natural superposition property of the wireless medium. We propose a wireless physical layer (PHY) design for OTA-FL which improves differential privacy (DP) through a decentralized, dynamic power control that utilizes both inherent Gaussian noise in the wireless channel and a cooperative jammer (CJ) for additional artificial noise generation when higher privacy levels are required. Although primarily implemented within the Upcycled-FL framework, where a resource-efficient method with first-order approximations is used at every even iteration to decrease the required information from clients, our power control strategy is applicable to any FL framework, including FedAvg and FedProx as shown in the paper. This adaptation showcases the flexibility and effectiveness of our design across different learning algorithms while maintaining a strong emphasis on privacy. Our design removes the need for client-side artificial noise injection for DP, utilizing a cooperative jammer to enhance privacy without affecting transmission efficiency for higher privacy demands. Privacy analysis is provided using the Moments Accountant method. We perform a convergence analysis for non-convex objectives to tackle heterogeneous data distributions, highlighting the inherent trade-offs between privacy and accuracy. Numerical results show that our approach with various FL algorithms outperforms the state-of-the-art under the same DP conditions on the non-i.i.d. FEMNIST dataset, and highlight the cooperative jammer's effectiveness in ensuring strict privacy.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing and Solving Inverse Problems using Data and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem involving the reconstruction of the solution to a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) with unknown boundary conditions. Instead of direct boundary data, we are provided with a large dataset of boundary observations for typical solutions (collective data) and a bulk measurement of a specific realization. To leverage this collective data, we first compress the boundary data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in a linear expansion. Next, we identify a possible nonlinear low-dimensional structure in the expansion coefficients using an auto-encoder, which provides a parametrization of the dataset in a lower-dimensional latent space. We then train a neural network to map the latent variables representing the boundary data to the solution of the PDE. Finally, we solve the inverse problem by optimizing a data-fitting term over the latent space.
  We analyze the underlying stabilized finite element method in the linear setting and establish optimal error estimates in the $H^1$ and $L^2$-norms. The nonlinear problem is then studied numerically, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>CA-SSLR: Condition-Aware Self-Supervised Learning Representation for Generalized Speech Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Condition-Aware Self-Supervised Learning Representation (CA-SSLR), a generalist conditioning model broadly applicable to various speech-processing tasks. Compared to standard fine-tuning methods that optimize for downstream models, CA-SSLR integrates language and speaker embeddings from earlier layers, making the SSL model aware of the current language and speaker context. This approach reduces the reliance on input audio features while preserving the integrity of the base SSLR. CA-SSLR improves the model's capabilities and demonstrates its generality on unseen tasks with minimal task-specific tuning. Our method employs linear modulation to dynamically adjust internal representations, enabling fine-grained adaptability without significantly altering the original model behavior. Experiments show that CA-SSLR reduces the number of trainable parameters, mitigates overfitting, and excels in under-resourced and unseen tasks. Specifically, CA-SSLR achieves a 10% relative reduction in LID errors, a 37% improvement in ASR CER on the ML-SUPERB benchmark, and a 27% decrease in SV EER on VoxCeleb-1, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Grounding Descriptions in Images informs Zero-Shot Visual Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been cherished for their ability to perform zero-shot visual recognition on open-vocabulary concepts. This is achieved by selecting the object category whose textual representation bears the highest similarity with the query image. While successful in some domains, this method struggles with identifying fine-grained entities as well as generalizing to unseen concepts that are not captured by the training distribution. Recent works attempt to mitigate these challenges by integrating category descriptions at test time, albeit yielding modest improvements. We attribute these limited gains to a fundamental misalignment between image and description representations, which is rooted in the pretraining structure of CLIP. In this paper, we propose GRAIN, a new pretraining strategy aimed at aligning representations at both fine and coarse levels simultaneously. Our approach learns to jointly ground textual descriptions in image regions along with aligning overarching captions with global image representations. To drive this pre-training, we leverage frozen Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to derive large-scale synthetic annotations. We demonstrate the enhanced zero-shot performance of our model compared to current state-of-the art methods across 11 diverse image classification datasets. Additionally, we introduce Products-2023, a newly curated, manually labeled dataset featuring novel concepts, and showcase our model's ability to recognize these concepts by benchmarking on it. Significant improvements achieved by our model on other downstream tasks like retrieval further highlight the superior quality of representations learned by our approach.

      <title>Moto: Latent Motion Token as the Bridging Language for Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Code-as-Monitor: Constraint-aware Visual Programming for Reactive and Proactive Robotic Failure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic detection and prevention of open-set failures are crucial in closed-loop robotic systems. Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by 31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>VisionZip: Longer is Better but Not Necessary in Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models have enhanced performance by increasing the length of visual tokens, making them much longer than text tokens and significantly raising computational costs. However, we observe that the visual tokens generated by popular vision encoders, such as CLIP and SigLIP, contain significant redundancy. To address this, we introduce VisionZip, a simple yet effective method that selects a set of informative tokens for input to the language model, reducing visual token redundancy and improving efficiency while maintaining model performance. The proposed VisionZip can be widely applied to image and video understanding tasks and is well-suited for multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios, where previous methods tend to underperform. Experimental results show that VisionZip outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by at least 5% performance gains across nearly all settings. Moreover, our method significantly enhances model inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 8x and enabling the LLaVA-Next 13B model to infer faster than the LLaVA-Next 7B model while achieving better results. Furthermore, we analyze the causes of this redundancy and encourage the community to focus on extracting better visual features rather than merely increasing token length.

      <title>When Stability meets Sufficiency: Informative Explanations that do not Overwhelm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies evaluating various criteria for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) suggest that fidelity, stability, and comprehensibility are among the most important metrics considered by users of AI across a diverse collection of usage contexts. We consider these criteria as applied to feature-based attribution methods, which are amongst the most prevalent in XAI literature. Going beyond standard correlation, methods have been proposed that highlight what should be minimally sufficient to justify the classification of an input (viz. pertinent positives). While minimal sufficiency is an attractive property akin to comprehensibility, the resulting explanations are often too sparse for a human to understand and evaluate the local behavior of the model. To overcome these limitations, we incorporate the criteria of stability and fidelity and propose a novel method called Path-Sufficient Explanations Method (PSEM) that outputs a sequence of stable and sufficient explanations for a given input of strictly decreasing size (or value) -- from original input to a minimally sufficient explanation -- which can be thought to trace the local boundary of the model in a stable manner, thus providing better intuition about the local model behavior for the specific input. We validate these claims, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with experiments that show the benefit of PSEM across three modalities (image, tabular and text) as well as versus other path explanations. A user study depicts the strength of the method in communicating the local behavior, where (many) users are able to correctly determine the prediction made by a model.</description>

      <title>Online Adversarial Knowledge Distillation for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation, a technique recently gaining popularity for enhancing model generalization in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), operates under the assumption that both teacher and student models are trained on identical data distributions. However, its effect on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is less than satisfactory since the graph topology and node attributes are prone to evolve, thereby leading to the issue of distribution shift. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by simultaneously training a group of graph neural networks in an online distillation fashion, where the group knowledge plays a role as a dynamic virtual teacher and the structure changes in graph neural networks are effectively captured. To improve the distillation performance, two types of knowledge are transferred among the students to enhance each other: local knowledge reflecting information in the graph topology and node attributes, and global knowledge reflecting the prediction over classes. We transfer the global knowledge with KL-divergence as the vanilla knowledge distillation does, while exploiting the complicated structure of the local knowledge with an efficient adversarial cyclic learning framework. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our proposed online adversarial distillation approach. The code is published at https://github.com/wangz3066/OnlineDistillGCN.</description>

      <title>Combining Stochastic Defenses to Resist Gradient Inversion: An Ablation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient Inversion (GI) attacks are a ubiquitous threat in Federated Learning (FL) as they exploit gradient leakage to reconstruct supposedly private training data. Common defense mechanisms such as Differential Privacy (DP) or stochastic Privacy Modules (PMs) introduce randomness during gradient computation to prevent such attacks. However, we pose that if an attacker effectively mimics a client's stochastic gradient computation, the attacker can circumvent the defense and reconstruct clients' private training data. This paper introduces several targeted GI attacks that leverage this principle to bypass common defense mechanisms. As a result, we demonstrate that no individual defense provides sufficient privacy protection. To address this issue, we propose to combine multiple defenses. We conduct an extensive ablation study to evaluate the influence of various combinations of defenses on privacy protection and model utility. We observe that only the combination of DP and a stochastic PM was sufficient to decrease the Attack Success Rate (ASR) from 100% to 0%, thus preserving privacy. Moreover, we found that this combination of defenses consistently achieves the best trade-off between privacy and model utility.</description>

      <title>Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM): An Exact Analysis Tool for Deep-Learned Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used in robotics as policies, state transition models, state estimation models, or all of the above. With these components being learned from data, it is important to be able to analyze what behaviors were learned and how this affects closed-loop performance. In this paper we take steps toward this goal by developing methods for computing control invariant sets and regions of attraction (ROAs) of dynamical systems represented as neural networks. We focus our attention on feedforward neural networks with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, which are known to implement continuous piecewise-affine (PWA) functions. We describe the Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM) algorithm for enumerating the affine pieces of a neural network through an incremental connected walk. We then use this algorithm to compute exact forward and backward reachable sets, from which we provide methods for computing control invariant sets and ROAs. Our approach is unique in that we find these sets incrementally, without Lyapunov-based tools. In our examples we demonstrate the ability of our approach to find non-convex control invariant sets and ROAs on tasks with learned van der Pol oscillator and pendulum models. Further, we provide an accelerated algorithm for computing ROAs that leverages the incremental and connected enumeration of affine regions that RPM provides. We show this acceleration to lead to a 15x speedup in our examples. Finally, we apply our methods to find a set of states that are stabilized by an image-based controller for an aircraft runway control problem.</description>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) generalization is known to be closely related to the flatness of minima, leading to the development of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) for seeking flatter minima and better generalization. In this paper, we revisit the loss of SAM and propose a more general method, called WSAM, by incorporating sharpness as a regularization term. We prove its generalization bound through the combination of PAC and Bayes-PAC techniques, and evaluate its performance on various public datasets. The results demonstrate that WSAM achieves improved generalization, or is at least highly competitive, compared to the vanilla optimizer, SAM and its variants. The code is available at https://github.com/intelligent-machine-learning/atorch/tree/main/atorch/optimizers.</description>

      <title>Quality In / Quality Out: Data quality more relevant than model choice in anomaly detection with the UGR'16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous or self-driving networks are expected to provide a solution to the myriad of extremely demanding new applications with minimal human supervision. For this purpose, the community relies on the development of new Machine Learning (ML) models and techniques. %, like the celebrated Deep Learning (DL). However, ML can only be as good as the data it is fitted with, and data quality is an elusive concept difficult to assess. In this paper, we show that relatively minor modifications on a benchmark dataset (UGR'16, a flow-based real-traffic dataset for anomaly detection) cause significantly more impact on model performance than the specific ML technique considered. We also show that the measured model performance is uncertain, as a result of labelling inaccuracies. Our findings illustrate that the widely adopted approach of comparing a set of models in terms of performance results (e.g., in terms of accuracy or ROC curves) may lead to incorrect conclusions when done without a proper understanding of dataset biases and sensitivity. We contribute a methodology to interpret a model response that can be useful for this understanding.</description>

Abstract: Widely used pipelines for analyzing high-dimensional data utilize two-dimensional visualizations. These are created, for instance, via t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). A crucial element of the t-SNE embedding procedure is the perplexity hyperparameter. That is because the embedding structure varies when perplexity is changed. A suitable perplexity choice depends on the data set and the intended usage for the embedding. Therefore, perplexity is often chosen based on heuristics, intuition, and prior experience. This paper uncovers a linear relationship between perplexity and the data set size. Namely, we show that embeddings remain structurally consistent across data set samples when perplexity is adjusted accordingly. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results support these findings. This informs the visualization process, guiding the user when choosing a perplexity value. Finally, we outline several applications for the visualization of high-dimensional data via t-SNE based on this linear relationship.</description>

      <title>Large Pre-trained time series models for cross-domain Time series analysis tasks</title>

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have been vital in recent advancements in domains like language and vision, making model training for individual downstream tasks more efficient and provide superior performance. However, tackling time-series analysis tasks usually involves designing and training a separate model from scratch leveraging training data and domain expertise specific to the task. We tackle a significant challenge for pre-training a foundational time-series model from multi-domain time-series datasets: extracting semantically useful tokenized inputs to the model across heterogenous time-series from different domains. We propose Large Pre-trained Time-series Models (LPTM) that introduces a novel method of adaptive segmentation that automatically identifies optimal dataset-specific segmentation strategy during pre-training. This enables LPTM to perform similar to or better than domain-specific state-of-art model when fine-tuned to different downstream time-series analysis tasks and under zero-shot settings. LPTM achieves superior forecasting and time-series classification results taking up to 40% less data and 50% less training time compared to state-of-art baselines.

      <title>DeiSAM: Segment Anything with Deictic Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale, pre-trained neural networks have demonstrated strong capabilities in various tasks, including zero-shot image segmentation. To identify concrete objects in complex scenes, humans instinctively rely on deictic descriptions in natural language, i.e., referring to something depending on the context such as "The object that is on the desk and behind the cup.". However, deep learning approaches cannot reliably interpret such deictic representations due to their lack of reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios. To remedy this issue, we propose DeiSAM -- a combination of large pre-trained neural networks with differentiable logic reasoners -- for deictic promptable segmentation. Given a complex, textual segmentation description, DeiSAM leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate first-order logic rules and performs differentiable forward reasoning on generated scene graphs. Subsequently, DeiSAM segments objects by matching them to the logically inferred image regions. As part of our evaluation, we propose the Deictic Visual Genome (DeiVG) dataset, containing paired visual input and complex, deictic textual prompts. Our empirical results demonstrate that DeiSAM is a substantial improvement over purely data-driven baselines for deictic promptable segmentation.</description>

      <title>Remaining-data-free Machine Unlearning by Suppressing Sample Contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is to forget data from a well-trained model, which is practically important due to the ``right to be forgotten''. The unlearned model should approach the retrained model, where the forgetting data are not involved in the training process and hence do not contribute to the retrained model. Considering the forgetting data's absence during retraining, we think unlearning should withdraw their contribution from the pre-trained model. The challenge is that when tracing the learning process is impractical, how to quantify and detach sample's contribution to the dynamic learning process using only the pre-trained model. We first theoretically discover that sample's contribution during the process will reflect in the learned model's sensitivity to it. We then practically design a novel method, namely MU-Mis (Machine Unlearning by Minimizing input sensitivity), to suppress the contribution of the forgetting data. Experimental results demonstrate that MU-Mis can unlearn effectively and efficiently without utilizing the remaining data. It is the first time that a remaining-data-free method can outperform state-of-the-art (SoTA) unlearning methods that utilize the remaining data.</description>

      <title>Fast and reliable uncertainty quantification with neural network ensembles for industrial image classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image classification with neural networks (NNs) is widely used in industrial processes, situations where the model likely encounters unknown objects during deployment, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Worryingly, NNs tend to make confident yet incorrect predictions when confronted with OOD data. To increase the models' reliability, they should quantify the uncertainty in their own predictions, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted. Deep ensembles, composed of multiple independent NNs, have been shown to perform strongly but are computationally expensive. Recent research has proposed more efficient NN ensembles, namely the snapshot, batch, and multi-input multi-output ensemble. This study investigates the predictive and uncertainty performance of efficient NN ensembles in the context of image classification for industrial processes. It is the first to provide a comprehensive comparison and it proposes a novel Diversity Quality metric to quantify the ensembles' performance on the in-distribution and OOD sets in one single metric. The results highlight the batch ensemble as a cost-effective and competitive alternative to the deep ensemble. It matches the deep ensemble in both uncertainty and accuracy while exhibiting considerable savings in training time, test time, and memory storage.</description>

      <title>PePR: Performance Per Resource Unit as a Metric to Promote Small-Scale Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advances in deep learning (DL) have been accelerated by access to large-scale data and compute. These large-scale resources have been used to train progressively larger models which are resource intensive in terms of compute, data, energy, and carbon emissions. These costs are becoming a new type of entry barrier to researchers and practitioners with limited access to resources at such scale, particularly in the Global South. In this work, we take a comprehensive look at the landscape of existing DL models for medical image analysis tasks and demonstrate their usefulness in settings where resources are limited. To account for the resource consumption of DL models, we introduce a novel measure to estimate the performance per resource unit, which we call the PePR score. Using a diverse family of 131 unique DL architectures (spanning 1M to 130M trainable parameters) and three medical image datasets, we capture trends about the performance-resource trade-offs. In applications like medical image analysis, we argue that small-scale, specialized models are better than striving for large-scale models. Furthermore, we show that using existing pretrained models that are fine-tuned on new data can significantly reduce the computational resources and data required compared to training models from scratch. We hope this work will encourage the community to focus on improving AI equity by developing methods and models with smaller resource footprints.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoders are PDE Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have great potential to generate fast and accurate physics solutions, yet their practicality is currently limited by their generalizability. PDEs evolve over broad scales and exhibit diverse behaviors; predicting these phenomena will require learning representations across a wide variety of inputs which may encompass different coefficients, boundary conditions, resolutions, or even equations. As a step towards generalizable PDE modeling, we adapt masked pretraining for physics problems. Through self-supervised learning across PDEs, masked autoencoders can consolidate heterogeneous physics to learn rich latent representations. We show that learned representations can generalize to a limited set of unseen equations or parameters and are meaningful enough to regress PDE coefficients or the classify PDE features. Furthermore, conditioning neural solvers on learned latent representations can improve time-stepping and super-resolution performance across a variety of coefficients, discretizations, or boundary conditions, as well as on certain unseen PDEs. We hope that masked pretraining can emerge as a unifying method across large, unlabeled, and heterogeneous datasets to learn latent physics at scale.</description>

      <title>PDNNet: PDN-Aware GNN-CNN Heterogeneous Network for Dynamic IR Drop Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: IR drop on the power delivery network (PDN) is closely related to PDN's configuration and cell current consumption. As the integrated circuit (IC) design is growing larger, dynamic IR drop simulation becomes computationally unaffordable and machine learning based IR drop prediction has been explored as a promising solution. Although CNN-based methods have been adapted to IR drop prediction task in several works, the shortcomings of overlooking PDN configuration is non-negligible. In this paper, we consider not only how to properly represent cell-PDN relation, but also how to model IR drop following its physical nature in the feature aggregation procedure. Thus, we propose a novel graph structure, PDNGraph, to unify the representations of the PDN structure and the fine-grained cell-PDN relation. We further propose a dual-branch heterogeneous network, PDNNet, incorporating two parallel GNN-CNN branches to favorably capture the above features during the learning process. Several key designs are presented to make the dynamic IR drop prediction highly effective and interpretable. We are the first work to apply graph structure to deep-learning based dynamic IR drop prediction method. Experiments show that PDNNet outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods and achieves 545x speedup compared to the commercial tool, which demonstrates the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Marrying Causal Representation Learning with Dynamical Systems for Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal representation learning promises to extend causal models to hidden causal variables from raw entangled measurements. However, most progress has focused on proving identifiability results in different settings, and we are not aware of any successful real-world application. At the same time, the field of dynamical systems benefited from deep learning and scaled to countless applications but does not allow parameter identification. In this paper, we draw a clear connection between the two and their key assumptions, allowing us to apply identifiable methods developed in causal representation learning to dynamical systems. At the same time, we can leverage scalable differentiable solvers developed for differential equations to build models that are both identifiable and practical. Overall, we learn explicitly controllable models that isolate the trajectory-specific parameters for further downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution classification or treatment effect estimation. We experiment with a wind simulator with partially known factors of variation. We also apply the resulting model to real-world climate data and successfully answer downstream causal questions in line with existing literature on climate change.</description>

      <title>LoRA-Ensemble: Efficient Uncertainty Modelling for Self-attention Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous crucial tasks in real-world decision-making rely on machine learning algorithms with calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, modern methods often yield overconfident and uncalibrated predictions. Various approaches involve training an ensemble of separate models to quantify the uncertainty related to the model itself, known as epistemic uncertainty. In an explicit implementation, the ensemble approach has high computational cost and high memory requirements. This particular challenge is evident in state-of-the-art neural networks such as transformers, where even a single network is already demanding in terms of compute and memory. Consequently, efforts are made to emulate the ensemble model without actually instantiating separate ensemble members, referred to as implicit ensembling. We introduce LoRA-Ensemble, a parameter-efficient deep ensemble method for self-attention networks, which is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Initially developed for efficient LLM fine-tuning, we extend LoRA to an implicit ensembling approach. By employing a single pre-trained self-attention network with weights shared across all members, we train member-specific low-rank matrices for the attention projections. Our method exhibits superior calibration compared to explicit ensembles and achieves similar or better accuracy across various prediction tasks and datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial aspect of understanding the complex nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the ability to explain learned concepts within their latent representations. While methods exist to connect neurons to human-understandable textual descriptions, evaluating the quality of these explanations is challenging due to the lack of a unified quantitative approach. We introduce CoSy (Concept Synthesis), a novel, architecture-agnostic framework for evaluating textual explanations of latent neurons. Given textual explanations, our proposed framework uses a generative model conditioned on textual input to create data points representing the explanations. By comparing the neuron's response to these generated data points and control data points, we can estimate the quality of the explanation. We validate our framework through sanity checks and benchmark various neuron description methods for Computer Vision tasks, revealing significant differences in quality.</description>

      <title>Simplified and Generalized Masked Diffusion for Discrete Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masked (or absorbing) diffusion is actively explored as an alternative to autoregressive models for generative modeling of discrete data. However, existing work in this area has been hindered by unnecessarily complex model formulations and unclear relationships between different perspectives, leading to suboptimal parameterization, training objectives, and ad hoc adjustments to counteract these issues. In this work, we aim to provide a simple and general framework that unlocks the full potential of masked diffusion models. We show that the continuous-time variational objective of masked diffusion models is a simple weighted integral of cross-entropy losses. Our framework also enables training generalized masked diffusion models with state-dependent masking schedules. When evaluated by perplexity, our models trained on OpenWebText surpass prior diffusion language models at GPT-2 scale and demonstrate superior performance on 4 out of 5 zero-shot language modeling tasks. Furthermore, our models vastly outperform previous discrete diffusion models on pixel-level image modeling, achieving 2.75 (CIFAR-10) and 3.40 (ImageNet 64x64) bits per dimension that are better than autoregressive models of similar sizes.</description>

      <title>Linear Causal Representation Learning from Unknown Multi-node Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the multifaceted recent advances in interventional causal representation learning (CRL), they primarily focus on the stylized assumption of single-node interventions. This assumption is not valid in a wide range of applications, and generally, the subset of nodes intervened in an interventional environment is fully unknown. This paper focuses on interventional CRL under unknown multi-node (UMN) interventional environments and establishes the first identifiability results for general latent causal models (parametric or nonparametric) under stochastic interventions (soft or hard) and linear transformation from the latent to observed space. Specifically, it is established that given sufficiently diverse interventional environments, (i) identifiability up to ancestors is possible using only soft interventions, and (ii) perfect identifiability is possible using hard interventions. Remarkably, these guarantees match the best-known results for more restrictive single-node interventions. Furthermore, CRL algorithms are also provided that achieve the identifiability guarantees. A central step in designing these algorithms is establishing the relationships between UMN interventional CRL and score functions associated with the statistical models of different interventional environments. Establishing these relationships also serves as constructive proof of the identifiability guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based models generate hidden states that are difficult to interpret. In this work, we aim to interpret these hidden states and control them at inference, with a focus on motion forecasting. We use linear probes to measure neural collapse towards interpretable motion features in hidden states. High probing accuracy implies meaningful directions and distances between hidden states of opposing features, which we use to fit interpretable control vectors for activation steering at inference. To optimize our control vectors, we use sparse autoencoders with fully-connected, convolutional, MLPMixer layers and various activation functions. Notably, we show that enforcing sparsity in hidden states leads to a more linear relationship between control vector temperatures and forecasts. Our approach enables mechanistic interpretability and zero-shot generalization to unseen dataset characteristics with negligible computational overhead.

      <title>GV-Rep: A Large-Scale Dataset for Genetic Variant Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Genetic variants (GVs) are defined as differences in the DNA sequences among individuals and play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating genetic diseases. The rapid decrease in next generation sequencing cost has led to an exponential increase in patient-level GV data. This growth poses a challenge for clinicians who must efficiently prioritize patient-specific GVs and integrate them with existing genomic databases to inform patient management. To addressing the interpretation of GVs, genomic foundation models (GFMs) have emerged. However, these models lack standardized performance assessments, leading to considerable variability in model evaluations. This poses the question: How effectively do deep learning methods classify unknown GVs and align them with clinically-verified GVs? We argue that representation learning, which transforms raw data into meaningful feature spaces, is an effective approach for addressing both indexing and classification challenges. We introduce a large-scale Genetic Variant dataset, named GV-Rep, featuring variable-length contexts and detailed annotations, designed for deep learning models to learn GV representations across various traits, diseases, tissue types, and experimental contexts. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) Construction of a comprehensive dataset with 7 million records, each labeled with characteristics of the corresponding variants, alongside additional data from 17,548 gene knockout tests across 1,107 cell types, 1,808 variant combinations, and 156 unique clinically verified GVs from real-world patients. (ii) Analysis of the structure and properties of the dataset. (iii) Experimentation of the dataset with pre-trained GFMs. The results show a significant gap between GFMs current capabilities and accurate GV representation. We hope this dataset will help advance genomic deep learning to bridge this gap.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Graph Transformer with Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning effective representations for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDGs) has garnered significant research interest, largely due to its powerful capabilities in modeling complex interactions between nodes. A fundamental and crucial requirement for representation learning in CTDGs is the appropriate estimation and preservation of proximity. However, due to the sparse and evolving characteristics of CTDGs, the spatial-temporal properties inherent in high-order proximity remain largely unexplored. Despite its importance, this property presents significant challenges due to the computationally intensive nature of personalized interaction intensity estimation and the dynamic attributes of CTDGs. To this end, we propose a novel Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional encoding that incorporates a parameter-free personalized interaction intensity estimation under the weak assumption of the Poisson Point Process. Building on this, we introduce the Dynamic Graph Transformer with Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding (CorDGT), which efficiently retains the evolving spatial-temporal high-order proximity for effective node representation learning in CTDGs. Extensive experiments on seven small and two large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of the proposed CorDGT.

      <title>Looking at Model Debiasing through the Lens of Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely recognized that deep neural networks are sensitive to bias in the data. This means that during training these models are likely to learn spurious correlations between data and labels, resulting in limited generalization abilities and low performance. In this context, model debiasing approaches can be devised aiming at reducing the model's dependency on such unwanted correlations, either leveraging the knowledge of bias information or not. In this work, we focus on the latter and more realistic scenario, showing the importance of accurately predicting the bias-conflicting and bias-aligned samples to obtain compelling performance in bias mitigation. On this ground, we propose to conceive the problem of model bias from an out-of-distribution perspective, introducing a new bias identification method based on anomaly detection. We claim that when data is mostly biased, bias-conflicting samples can be regarded as outliers with respect to the bias-aligned distribution in the feature space of a biased model, thus allowing for precisely detecting them with an anomaly detection method. Coupling the proposed bias identification approach with bias-conflicting data upsampling and augmentation in a two-step strategy, we reach state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real benchmark datasets. Ultimately, our proposed approach shows that the data bias issue does not necessarily require complex debiasing methods, given that an accurate bias identification procedure is defined.

      <title>Objective Features Extracted from Motor Activity Time Series for Food Addiction Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates machine learning algorithms to identify objective features for diagnosing food addiction (FA) and assessing confirmed symptoms (SC). Data were collected from 81 participants (mean age: 21.5 years, range: 18-61 years, women: 77.8%) whose FA and SC were measured using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). Participants provided demographic and anthropometric data, completed the YFAS, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and wore an actimeter on the non-dominant wrist for a week to record motor activity. Analysis of the actimetric data identified significant statistical and entropy-based features that accurately predicted FA and SC using ML. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was the primary metric. Activity-related features were more effective for FA prediction (MCC=0.88) than rest-related features (MCC=0.68). For SC, activity segments yielded MCC=0.47, rest segments MCC=0.38, and their combination MCC=0.51. Significant correlations were also found between actimetric features related to FA, emotional, and restrained eating behaviors, supporting the model's validity. Our results support the concept of a human bionic suite composed of IoT devices and ML sensors, which implements health digital assistance with real-time monitoring and analysis of physiological indicators related to FA and SC.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Large Medical Model: State of the art healthcare cost and risk prediction with transformers trained on patient event sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With U.S. healthcare spending approaching $5T (NHE Fact Sheet 2024), and 25% of it estimated to be wasteful (Waste in the US the health care system: estimated costs and potential for savings, n.d.), the need to better predict risk and optimal patient care is evermore important. This paper introduces the Large Medical Model (LMM), a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) designed to guide and predict the broad facets of patient care and healthcare administration. The model is trained on medical event sequences from over 140M longitudinal patient claims records with a specialized vocabulary built from medical terminology systems and demonstrates a superior capability to forecast healthcare costs and identify potential risk factors. Through experimentation and validation, we showcase the LMM's proficiency in not only in cost and risk predictions, but also in discerning intricate patterns within complex medical conditions and an ability to identify novel relationships in patient care. The LMM is able to improve both cost prediction by 14.1% over the best commercial models and chronic conditions prediction by 1.9% over the best transformer models in research predicting a broad set of conditions. The LMM is a substantial advancement in healthcare analytics, offering the potential to significantly enhance risk assessment, cost management, and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Is uniform expressivity too restrictive? Towards efficient expressivity of graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniform expressivity guarantees that a Graph Neural Network (GNN) can express a query without the parameters depending on the size of the input graphs. This property is desirable in applications in order to have number of trainable parameters that is independent of the size of the input graphs. Uniform expressivity of the two variable guarded fragment (GC2) of first order logic is a well-celebrated result for Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) GNNs [Barcelo &amp; al., 2020]. In this article, we prove that uniform expressivity of GC2 queries is not possible for GNNs with a wide class of Pfaffian activation functions (including the sigmoid and tanh), answering a question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. We also show that despite these limitations, many of those GNNs can still efficiently express GC2 queries in a way that the number of parameters remains logarithmic on the maximal degree of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a log-log dependency on the degree is achievable for a certain choice of activation function. This shows that uniform expressivity can be successfully relaxed by covering large graphs appearing in practical applications. Our experiments illustrates that our theoretical estimates hold in practice.</description>

      <title>SwiftKV: Fast Prefill-Optimized Inference with Knowledge-Preserving Model Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs. Our training, inference, and model implementations are open-sourced and can be found through https://huggingface.co/collections/Snowflake/swiftkv-models-674f7d7474eb789e185d31cb.</description>

      <title>Model-GLUE: Democratized LLM Scaling for A Large Model Zoo in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across tasks and specialized domains, scaling LLMs based on existing models has garnered significant attention, which faces the challenge of decreasing performance when combining disparate models. Various techniques have been proposed for the aggregation of pre-trained LLMs, including model merging, Mixture-of-Experts, and stacking. Despite their merits, a comprehensive comparison and synergistic application of them to a diverse model zoo is yet to be adequately addressed. In light of this research gap, this paper introduces Model-GLUE, a holistic LLM scaling guideline. First, our work starts with a benchmarking of existing LLM scaling techniques, especially selective merging, and variants of mixture. Utilizing the insights from the benchmark results, we formulate an optimal strategy for the selection and aggregation of a heterogeneous model zoo characterizing different architectures and initialization.Our methodology involves the clustering of mergeable models and optimal merging strategy selection, and the integration of clusters through a model mixture. Finally, evidenced by our experiments on a diverse Llama-2-based model zoo, Model-GLUE shows an average performance enhancement of 5.61%, achieved without additional training.

      <title>Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent efforts in fine-tuning language models often rely on automatic data selection, commonly using Nearest Neighbors retrieval from large datasets. However, we theoretically show that this approach tends to select redundant data, limiting its effectiveness or even hurting performance. To address this, we introduce SIFT, a data selection algorithm designed to reduce uncertainty about the model's response given a prompt, which unifies ideas from retrieval and active learning. Whereas Nearest Neighbor retrieval typically fails in the presence of information duplication, SIFT accounts for information duplication and optimizes the overall information gain of the selected examples. We focus our evaluations on fine-tuning at test-time for prompt-specific language modeling on the Pile dataset, and show that SIFT consistently outperforms Nearest Neighbor retrieval, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, we show that our uncertainty estimates can predict the performance gain of test-time fine-tuning, and use this to develop an adaptive algorithm that invests test-time compute proportional to realized performance gains. We provide the $\texttt{activeft}$ (Active Fine-Tuning) library which can be used as a drop-in replacement for Nearest Neighbor retrieval.</description>

      <title>Context Matters: Leveraging Contextual Features for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series forecasts are often influenced by exogenous contextual features in addition to their corresponding history. For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Unlearning: Robust Knowledge Unlearning and Editing via Mechanistic Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods for knowledge editing and unlearning in large language models seek to edit or remove undesirable knowledge or capabilities without compromising general language modeling performance. This work investigates how mechanistic interpretability -- which, in part, aims to identify model components (circuits) associated to specific interpretable mechanisms that make up a model capability -- can improve the precision and effectiveness of editing and unlearning. We find a stark difference in unlearning and edit robustness when training components localized by different methods. We highlight an important distinction between methods that localize components based primarily on preserving outputs, and those finding high level mechanisms with predictable intermediate states. In particular, localizing edits/unlearning to components associated with the lookup-table mechanism for factual recall 1) leads to more robust edits/unlearning across different input/output formats, and 2) resists attempts to relearn the unwanted information, while also reducing unintended side effects compared to baselines, on both a sports facts dataset and the CounterFact dataset across multiple models. We also find that certain localized edits disrupt the latent knowledge in the model more than any other baselines, making unlearning more robust to various attacks.</description>

      <title>Learning on Model Weights using Tree Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing availability of public models begs the question: can we train neural networks that use other networks as input? Such models allow us to study different aspects of a given neural network, for example, determining the categories in a model's training dataset. However, machine learning on model weights is challenging as they often exhibit significant variation unrelated to the models' semantic properties (nuisance variation). Here, we identify a key property of real-world models: most public models belong to a small set of Model Trees, where all models within a tree are fine-tuned from a common ancestor (e.g., a foundation model). Importantly, we find that within each tree there is less nuisance variation between models. Concretely, while learning across Model Trees requires complex architectures, even a linear classifier trained on a single model layer often works within trees. While effective, these linear classifiers are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with larger models that have many parameters. To address this, we introduce Probing Experts (ProbeX), a theoretically motivated and lightweight method. Notably, ProbeX is the first probing method specifically designed to learn from the weights of a single hidden model layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbeX by predicting the categories in a model's training dataset based only on its weights. Excitingly, ProbeX can also map the weights of Stable Diffusion into a shared weight-language embedding space, enabling zero-shot model classification.</description>

      <title>In-context learning and Occam's razor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central goal of machine learning is generalization. While the No Free Lunch Theorem states that we cannot obtain theoretical guarantees for generalization without further assumptions, in practice we observe that simple models which explain the training data generalize best: a principle called Occam's razor. Despite the need for simple models, most current approaches in machine learning only minimize the training error, and at best indirectly promote simplicity through regularization or architecture design. Here, we draw a connection between Occam's razor and in-context learning: an emergent ability of certain sequence models like Transformers to learn at inference time from past observations in a sequence. In particular, we show that the next-token prediction loss used to train in-context learners is directly equivalent to a data compression technique called prequential coding, and that minimizing this loss amounts to jointly minimizing both the training error and the complexity of the model that was implicitly learned from context. Our theory and the empirical experiments we use to support it not only provide a normative account of in-context learning, but also elucidate the shortcomings of current in-context learning methods, suggesting ways in which they can be improved. We make our code available at https://github.com/3rdCore/PrequentialCode.</description>

      <title>Relax and Merge: A Simple Yet Effective Framework for Solving Fair $k$-Means and $k$-sparse Wasserstein Barycenter Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fairness of clustering algorithms has gained widespread attention across various areas, including machine learning, In this paper, we study fair $k$-means clustering in Euclidean space. Given a dataset comprising several groups, the fairness constraint requires that each cluster should contain a proportion of points from each group within specified lower and upper bounds. Due to these fairness constraints, determining the optimal locations of $k$ centers is a quite challenging task. We propose a novel ``Relax and Merge'' framework that returns a $(1+4\rho + O(\epsilon))$-approximate solution, where $\rho$ is the approximate ratio of an off-the-shelf vanilla $k$-means algorithm and $O(\epsilon)$ can be an arbitrarily small positive number. If equipped with a PTAS of $k$-means, our solution can achieve an approximation ratio of $(5+O(\epsilon))$ with only a slight violation of the fairness constraints, which improves the current state-of-the-art approximation guarantee. Furthermore, using our framework, we can also obtain a $(1+4\rho +O(\epsilon))$-approximate solution for the $k$-sparse Wasserstein Barycenter problem, which is a fundamental optimization problem in the field of optimal transport, and a $(2+6\rho)$-approximate solution for the strictly fair $k$-means clustering with no violation, both of which are better than the current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the empirical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of clustering cost.</description>

      <title>Marginal Causal Flows for Validation and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the marginal causal effect of an intervention on an outcome from complex data remains challenging due to the inflexibility of employed models and the lack of complexity in causal benchmark datasets, which often fail to reproduce intricate real-world data patterns. In this paper we introduce Frugal Flows, a novel likelihood-based machine learning model that uses normalising flows to flexibly learn the data-generating process, while also directly inferring the marginal causal quantities from observational data. We propose that these models are exceptionally well suited for generating synthetic data to validate causal methods. They can create synthetic datasets that closely resemble the empirical dataset, while automatically and exactly satisfying a user-defined average treatment effect. To our knowledge, Frugal Flows are the first generative model to both learn flexible data representations and also exactly parameterise quantities such as the average treatment effect and the degree of unobserved confounding. We demonstrate the above with experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Monkeys at Play: Random Augmentations Cheaply Break LLM Safety Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently become a critical objective of model developers. In response, a growing body of work has been investigating how safety alignment can be bypassed through various jailbreaking methods, such as adversarial attacks. However, these jailbreak methods can be rather costly or involve a non-trivial amount of creativity and effort, introducing the assumption that malicious users are high-resource or sophisticated. In this paper, we study how simple random augmentations to the input prompt affect safety alignment effectiveness in state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama 3 and Qwen 2. We perform an in-depth evaluation of 17 different models and investigate the intersection of safety under random augmentations with multiple dimensions: augmentation type, model size, quantization, fine-tuning-based defenses, and decoding strategies (e.g., sampling temperature). We show that low-resource and unsophisticated attackers, i.e. $\textit{stochastic monkeys}$, can significantly improve their chances of bypassing alignment with just 25 random augmentations per prompt.

      <title>Scaling Laws for Task-Optimized Models of the Primate Visual Ventral Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When trained on large-scale object classification datasets, certain artificial neural network models begin to approximate core object recognition (COR) behaviors and neural response patterns in the primate visual ventral stream (VVS). While recent machine learning advances suggest that scaling model size, dataset size, and compute resources improve task performance, the impact of scaling on brain alignment remains unclear. In this study, we explore scaling laws for modeling the primate VVS by systematically evaluating over 600 models trained under controlled conditions on benchmarks spanning V1, V2, V4, IT and COR behaviors. We observe that while behavioral alignment continues to scale with larger models, neural alignment saturates. This observation remains true across model architectures and training datasets, even though models with stronger inductive bias and datasets with higher-quality images are more compute-efficient. Increased scaling is especially beneficial for higher-level visual areas, where small models trained on few samples exhibit only poor alignment. Finally, we develop a scaling recipe, indicating that a greater proportion of compute should be allocated to data samples over model size. Our results suggest that while scaling alone might suffice for alignment with human core object recognition behavior, it will not yield improved models of the brain's visual ventral stream with current architectures and datasets, highlighting the need for novel strategies in building brain-like models.</description>

      <title>Dockformer: A transformer-based molecular docking paradigm for large-scale virtual screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06740v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial step in drug development, which enables the virtual screening of compound libraries to identify potential ligands that target proteins of interest. However, the computational complexity of traditional docking models increases as the size of the compound library increases. Recently, deep learning algorithms can provide data-driven research and development models to increase the speed of the docking process. Unfortunately, few models can achieve superior screening performance compared to that of traditional models. Therefore, a novel deep learning-based docking approach named Dockformer is introduced in this study. Dockformer leverages multimodal information to capture the geometric topology and structural knowledge of molecules and can directly generate binding conformations with the corresponding confidence measures in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results show that Dockformer achieves success rates of 90.53% and 82.71% on the PDBbind core set and PoseBusters benchmarks, respectively, and more than a 100-fold increase in the inference process speed, outperforming almost all state-of-the-art docking methods. In addition, the ability of Dockformer to identify the main protease inhibitors of coronaviruses is demonstrated in a real-world virtual screening scenario. Considering its high docking accuracy and screening efficiency, Dockformer can be regarded as a powerful and robust tool in the field of drug design.</description>

      <title>Don't Be So Positive: Negative Step Sizes in Second-Order Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The value of second-order methods lies in the use of curvature information. Yet, this information is costly to extract and once obtained, valuable negative curvature information is often discarded so that the method is globally convergent. This limits the effectiveness of second-order methods in modern machine learning. In this paper, we show that second-order and second-order-like methods are promising optimizers for neural networks provided that we add one ingredient: negative step sizes. We show that under very general conditions, methods that produce ascent directions are globally convergent when combined with a Wolfe line search that allows both positive and negative step sizes. We experimentally demonstrate that using negative step sizes is often more effective than common Hessian modification methods.</description>

      <title>On Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-agent systems, the agent behavior is highly influenced by its utility function, as these utilities shape both individual goals as well as interactions with the other agents. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a well-established approach to inferring the utility function by observing an expert behavior within a given environment. In this paper, we extend the IRL framework to the multi-agent setting, assuming to observe agents who are following Nash Equilibrium (NE) policies. We theoretically investigate the set of utilities that explain the behavior of NE experts. Specifically, we provide an explicit characterization of the feasible reward set and analyze how errors in estimating the transition dynamics and expert behavior impact the recovered rewards. Building on these findings, we provide the first sample complexity analysis for the multi-agent IRL problem. Finally, we provide a numerical evaluation of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Circuit Behavior and Generalization in Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the inner workings of large neural networks by identifying circuits, or minimal subgraphs within the model that implement algorithms responsible for performing specific tasks. These circuits are typically discovered and analyzed using a narrowly defined prompt format. However, given the abilities of large language models (LLMs) to generalize across various prompt formats for the same task, it remains unclear how well these circuits generalize. For instance, it is unclear whether the models generalization results from reusing the same circuit components, the components behaving differently, or the use of entirely different components. In this paper, we investigate the generality of the indirect object identification (IOI) circuit in GPT-2 small, which is well-studied and believed to implement a simple, interpretable algorithm. We evaluate its performance on prompt variants that challenge the assumptions of this algorithm. Our findings reveal that the circuit generalizes surprisingly well, reusing all of its components and mechanisms while only adding additional input edges. Notably, the circuit generalizes even to prompt variants where the original algorithm should fail; we discover a mechanism that explains this which we term S2 Hacking. Our findings indicate that circuits within LLMs may be more flexible and general than previously recognized, underscoring the importance of studying circuit generalization to better understand the broader capabilities of these models.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Proximal Policy Optimization Learning Using Task Prediction for Solving Environments with Delayed Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of delayed rewards in reinforcement learning (RL). While Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as a leading Policy Gradient method, its performance can degrade under delayed rewards. We introduce two key enhancements to PPO: a hybrid policy architecture that combines an offline policy (trained on expert demonstrations) with an online PPO policy, and a reward shaping mechanism using Time Window Temporal Logic (TWTL). The hybrid architecture leverages offline data throughout training while maintaining PPO's theoretical guarantees. Building on the monotonic improvement framework of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), we prove that our approach ensures improvement over both the offline policy and previous iterations, with a bounded performance gap of $(2\varsigma\gamma\alpha^2)/(1-\gamma)^2$, where $\alpha$ is the mixing parameter, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $\varsigma$ bounds the expected advantage. Additionally, we prove that our TWTL-based reward shaping preserves the optimal policy of the original problem. TWTL enables formal translation of temporal objectives into immediate feedback signals that guide learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on an inverted pendulum and a lunar lander environments, showing improvements in both learning speed and final performance compared to standard PPO and offline-only approaches.</description>

      <title>Visual Error Patterns in Multi-Modal AI: A Statistical Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, excel at integrating text and visual data but face systematic challenges when interpreting ambiguous or incomplete visual stimuli [9]. This study leverages statistical modeling to analyze the factors driving these errors, using a dataset of geometric stimuli characterized by features like 3D, rotation, and missing face/side. We applied parametric methods, non-parametric methods, and ensemble techniques to predict classification errors, with the non-linear gradient boosting model achieving the highest performance (AUC=0.85) during cross-validation. Feature importance analysis highlighted difficulties in depth perception and reconstructing incomplete structures as key contributors to misclassification. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of statistical approaches for uncovering limitations in MLLMs and offer actionable insights for enhancing model architectures by integrating contextual reasoning mechanisms.</description>

      <title>RILQ: Rank-Insensitive LoRA-based Quantization Error Compensation for Boosting 2-bit Large Language Model Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become the dominant method for parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning, with LoRA-based quantization error compensation (LQEC) emerging as a powerful tool for recovering accuracy in compressed LLMs. However, LQEC has underperformed in sub-4-bit scenarios, with no prior investigation into understanding this limitation. We propose RILQ (Rank-Insensitive LoRA-based Quantization Error Compensation) to understand fundamental limitation and boost 2-bit LLM accuracy. Based on rank analysis revealing model-wise activation discrepancy loss's rank-insensitive nature, RILQ employs this loss to adjust adapters cooperatively across layers, enabling robust error compensation with low-rank adapters. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 demonstrate RILQ's consistent improvements in 2-bit quantized inference across various state-of-the-art quantizers and enhanced accuracy in task-specific fine-tuning. RILQ maintains computational efficiency comparable to existing LoRA methods, enabling adapter-merged weight-quantized LLM inference with significantly enhanced accuracy, making it a promising approach for boosting 2-bit LLM performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Semantic Association Rules from Internet of Things Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of discovering commonalities in data in the form of logical implications. ARM is used in the Internet of Things (IoT) for different tasks including monitoring and decision-making. However, existing methods give limited consideration to IoT-specific requirements such as heterogeneity and volume. Furthermore, they do not utilize important static domain-specific description data about IoT systems, which is increasingly represented as knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel ARM pipeline for IoT data that utilizes both dynamic sensor data and static IoT system metadata. Furthermore, we propose an Autoencoder-based Neurosymbolic ARM method (Aerial) as part of the pipeline to address the high volume of IoT data and reduce the total number of rules that are resource-intensive to process. Aerial learns a neural representation of a given data and extracts association rules from this representation by exploiting the reconstruction (decoding) mechanism of an autoencoder. Extensive evaluations on 3 IoT datasets from 2 domains show that ARM on both static and dynamic IoT data results in more generically applicable rules while Aerial can learn a more concise set of high-quality association rules than the state-of-the-art with full coverage over the datasets.</description>

      <title>PBP: Post-training Backdoor Purification for Malware Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rise of machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity has brought new challenges, including the increasing threat of backdoor poisoning attacks on ML malware classifiers. For instance, adversaries could inject malicious samples into public malware repositories, contaminating the training data and potentially misclassifying malware by the ML model. Current countermeasures predominantly focus on detecting poisoned samples by leveraging disagreements within the outputs of a diverse set of ensemble models on training data points. However, these methods are not suitable for scenarios where Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) is used or when users aim to remove backdoors from a model after it has been trained. Addressing this scenario, we introduce PBP, a post-training defense for malware classifiers that mitigates various types of backdoor embeddings without assuming any specific backdoor embedding mechanism. Our method exploits the influence of backdoor attacks on the activation distribution of neural networks, independent of the trigger-embedding method. In the presence of a backdoor attack, the activation distribution of each layer is distorted into a mixture of distributions. By regulating the statistics of the batch normalization layers, we can guide a backdoored model to perform similarly to a clean one. Our method demonstrates substantial advantages over several state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by experiments on two datasets, two types of backdoor methods, and various attack configurations. Notably, our approach requires only a small portion of the training data -- only 1\% -- to purify the backdoor and reduce the attack success rate from 100\% to almost 0\%, a 100-fold improvement over the baseline methods. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/judydnguyen/pbp-backdoor-purification-official}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.04797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A core problem in statistics and probabilistic machine learning is to compute probability distributions and expectations. This is the fundamental problem of Bayesian statistics and machine learning, which frames all inference as expectations with respect to the posterior distribution. The key challenge is to approximate these intractable expectations. In this tutorial, we review sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), a random-sampling-based class of methods for approximate inference. First, we explain the basics of SMC, discuss practical issues, and review theoretical results. We then examine two of the main user design choices: the proposal distributions and the so called intermediate target distributions. We review recent results on how variational inference and amortization can be used to learn efficient proposals and target distributions. Next, we discuss the SMC estimate of the normalizing constant, how this can be used for pseudo-marginal inference and inference evaluation. Throughout the tutorial we illustrate the use of SMC on various models commonly used in machine learning, such as stochastic recurrent neural networks, probabilistic graphical models, and probabilistic programs.</description>

      <title>Practical Operator Sketching Framework for Accelerating Iterative Data-Driven Solutions in Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new operator-sketching paradigm for designing efficient iterative data-driven reconstruction (IDR) schemes, e.g. Plug-and-Play algorithms and deep unrolling networks. These IDR schemes are currently the state-of-the-art solutions for imaging inverse problems. However, for high-dimensional imaging tasks, especially X-ray CT and MRI imaging, these IDR schemes typically become inefficient both in terms of computation, due to the need of computing multiple times the high-dimensional forward and adjoint operators. In this work, we explore and propose a universal dimensionality reduction framework for accelerating IDR schemes in solving imaging inverse problems, based on leveraging the sketching techniques from stochastic optimization. Using this framework, we derive a number of accelerated IDR schemes, such as the plug-and-play multi-stage sketched gradient (PnP-MS2G) and sketching-based primal-dual (LSPD and Sk-LSPD) deep unrolling networks. Meanwhile, for fully accelerating PnP schemes when the denoisers are computationally expensive, we provide novel stochastic lazy denoising schemes (Lazy-PnP and Lazy-PnP-EQ), leveraging the ProxSkip scheme in optimization and equivariant image denoisers, which can massively accelerate the PnP algorithms with improved practicality. We provide theoretical analysis for recovery guarantees of instances of the proposed framework. Our numerical experiments on natural image processing and tomographic image reconstruction demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our sketched IDR schemes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13646v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Focusing on stochastic programming (SP) with covariate information, this paper proposes an empirical risk minimization (ERM) method embedded within a nonconvex piecewise affine decision rule (PADR), which aims to learn the direct mapping from features to optimal decisions. We establish the nonasymptotic consistency result of our PADR-based ERM model for unconstrained problems and asymptotic consistency result for constrained ones. To solve the nonconvex and nondifferentiable ERM problem, we develop an enhanced stochastic majorization-minimization algorithm and establish the asymptotic convergence to (composite strong) directional stationarity along with complexity analysis. We show that the proposed PADR-based ERM method applies to a broad class of nonconvex SP problems with theoretical consistency guarantees and computational tractability. Our numerical study demonstrates the superior performance of PADR-based ERM methods compared to state-of-the-art approaches under various settings, with significantly lower costs, less computation time, and robustness to feature dimensions and nonlinearity of the underlying dependency.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Synthetic Data via Foundation Model APIs 1: Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating differentially private (DP) synthetic data that closely resembles the original private data is a scalable way to mitigate privacy concerns in the current data-driven world. In contrast to current practices that train customized models for this task, we aim to generate DP Synthetic Data via APIs (DPSDA), where we treat foundation models as blackboxes and only utilize their inference APIs. Such API-based, training-free approaches are easier to deploy as exemplified by the recent surge in the number of API-based apps. These approaches can also leverage the power of large foundation models which are only accessible via their inference APIs. However, this comes with greater challenges due to strictly more restrictive model access and the need to protect privacy from the API provider.
  In this paper, we present a new framework called Private Evolution (PE) to solve this problem and show its initial promise on synthetic images. Surprisingly, PE can match or even outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods without any model training. For example, on CIFAR10 (with ImageNet as the public data), we achieve FID &lt;= 7.9 with privacy cost {\epsilon} = 0.67, significantly improving the previous SOTA from {\epsilon} = 32. We further demonstrate the promise of applying PE on large foundation models such as Stable Diffusion to tackle challenging private datasets with a small number of high-resolution images. The code and data are released at https://github.com/microsoft/DPSDA.</description>

      <title>Regularization by Neural Style Transfer for MRI Field-Transfer Reconstruction with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in MRI reconstruction have achieved remarkable success with deep learning-based models. However, most methods depend on large-scale, task-specific datasets, leaving reconstruction in data-limited settings as a critical but underexplored challenge. Regularization by denoising (RED) is a general pipeline that incorporates a denoiser as a prior for image reconstruction, showing promising results in various image processing tasks, including denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution. In this work, we propose a regularization by neural style transfer (RNST) method to further leverage the priors from the neural transfer and denoising engine. RNST effectively reconstructs high-quality images from noisy, low-quality inputs across varying image styles, even with limited data. We validate RNST on clinical MRI scans, demonstrating its ability to significantly improve image quality. These findings underline the potential of RNST for MRI field-transfer reconstruction and its promise in addressing reconstruction tasks in data-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present RLLTE: a long-term evolution, extremely modular, and open-source framework for reinforcement learning (RL) research and application. Beyond delivering top-notch algorithm implementations, RLLTE also serves as a toolkit for developing algorithms. More specifically, RLLTE decouples the RL algorithms completely from the exploitation-exploration perspective, providing a large number of components to accelerate algorithm development and evolution. In particular, RLLTE is the first RL framework to build a comprehensive ecosystem, which includes model training, evaluation, deployment, benchmark hub, and large language model (LLM)-empowered copilot. RLLTE is expected to set standards for RL engineering practice and be highly stimulative for industry and academia. Our documentation, examples, and source code are available at https://github.com/RLE-Foundation/rllte.</description>

      <title>A Fisher-Rao gradient flow for entropy-regularised Markov decision processes in Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global convergence of a Fisher-Rao policy gradient flow for infinite-horizon entropy-regularised Markov decision processes with Polish state and action space. The flow is a continuous-time analogue of a policy mirror descent method. We establish the global well-posedness of the gradient flow and demonstrate its exponential convergence to the optimal policy. Moreover, we prove the flow is stable with respect to gradient evaluation, offering insights into the performance of a natural policy gradient flow with log-linear policy parameterisation. To overcome challenges stemming from the lack of the convexity of the objective function and the discontinuity arising from the entropy regulariser, we leverage the performance difference lemma and the duality relationship between the gradient and mirror descent flows. Our analysis provides a theoretical foundation for developing various discrete policy gradient algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reconstruct Accelerated MRI Through K-space Cold Diffusion without Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based MRI reconstruction models have achieved superior performance these days. Most recently, diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image generation, in-painting, super-resolution, image editing and more. As a generalized diffusion model, cold diffusion further broadens the scope and considers models built around arbitrary image transformations such as blurring, down-sampling, etc. In this paper, we propose a k-space cold diffusion model that performs image degradation and restoration in k-space without the need for Gaussian noise. We provide comparisons with multiple deep learning-based MRI reconstruction models and perform tests on a well-known large open-source MRI dataset. Our results show that this novel way of performing degradation can generate high-quality reconstruction images for accelerated MRI.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Novel Object Detection via Cooperative Foundational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenging and emergent problem of novel object detection (NOD), focusing on the accurate detection of both known and novel object categories during inference. Traditional object detection algorithms are inherently closed-set, limiting their capability to handle NOD. We present a novel approach to transform existing closed-set detectors into open-set detectors. This transformation is achieved by leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained foundational models, specifically CLIP and SAM, through our cooperative mechanism. Furthermore, by integrating this mechanism with state-of-the-art open-set detectors such as GDINO, we establish new benchmarks in object detection performance. Our method achieves 17.42 mAP in novel object detection and 42.08 mAP for known objects on the challenging LVIS dataset. Adapting our approach to the COCO OVD split, we surpass the current state-of-the-art by a margin of 7.2 $ \text{AP}_{50} $ for novel classes.

      <title>Labrador: Exploring the Limits of Masked Language Modeling for Laboratory Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce Labrador, a pre-trained Transformer model for laboratory data. Labrador and BERT were pre-trained on a corpus of 100 million lab test results from electronic health records (EHRs) and evaluated on various downstream outcome prediction tasks. Both models demonstrate mastery of the pre-training task but neither consistently outperform XGBoost on downstream supervised tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that transfer learning shows limited effectiveness for BERT and achieves marginal success with Labrador. We explore the reasons for the failure of transfer learning and suggest that the data generating process underlying each patient cannot be characterized sufficiently using labs alone, among other factors. We encourage future work to focus on joint modeling of multiple EHR data categories and to include tree-based baselines in their evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a key issue when considering the application of deep neural network methods in science and engineering. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that quantifies epistemic uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling from a tempered posterior distribution. It combines the well established Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) with momentum-based optimization using Adam and leverages a prolate proposal distribution, to efficiently draw from the posterior. We prove that the constructed chain admits the Gibbs posterior as invariant distribution and approximates this posterior in total variation distance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting algorithm and the merit of the proposed changes on a state-of-the-art classifier from high-energy particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The enduring inability of image generative models to recreate intricate geometric features, such as those present in human hands and fingers has been an ongoing problem in image generation for nearly a decade. While strides have been made by increasing model sizes and diversifying training datasets, this issue remains prevalent across all models, from denoising diffusion models to Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), pointing to a fundamental shortcoming in the underlying architectures. In this paper, we demonstrate how this problem can be mitigated by augmenting convolution layers geometric capabilities through providing them with a single input channel incorporating the relative n-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. We show this drastically improves quality of images generated by Diffusion Models, GANs, and Variational AutoEncoders (VAE).</description>

      <title>Diffusion of Thoughts: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have garnered significant interest in the field of text processing due to their many potential advantages compared to conventional autoregressive models. In this work, we propose Diffusion-of-Thought (DoT), a novel approach that integrates diffusion models with Chain-of-Thought, a well-established technique for improving the reasoning ability of autoregressive language models. In contrast to autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT allows reasoning steps to diffuse over time through a diffusion language model and offers greater flexibility in trading-off computation for reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication, boolean logic, and grade school math problems, with a small diffusion model outperforming a much larger autoregressive model in both efficiency and accuracy. In addition to that, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding. Our findings contribute to the understanding and development of reasoning with diffusion language models.</description>

      <title>SmallToLarge (S2L): Scalable Data Selection for Fine-tuning Large Language Models by Summarizing Training Trajectories of Small Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of data selection for large language models (LLMs) during pretraining and instruction fine-tuning phases, improving data efficiency in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for specialized domains poses significant challenges due to the complexity of fine-tuning data. To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.</description>

      <title>A Semidefinite Programming-Based Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for Biclustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biclustering, also called co-clustering, block clustering, or two-way clustering, involves the simultaneous clustering of both the rows and columns of a data matrix into distinct groups, such that the rows and columns within a group display similar patterns. As a model problem for biclustering, we consider the $k$-densest-disjoint biclique problem, whose goal is to identify $k$ disjoint complete bipartite subgraphs (called bicliques) of a given weighted complete bipartite graph such that the sum of their densities is maximized. To address this problem, we present a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm. For the upper bound routine, we consider a semidefinite programming relaxation and propose valid inequalities to strengthen the bound. We solve this relaxation in a cutting-plane fashion using a first-order method. For the lower bound, we design a maximum weight matching rounding procedure that exploits the solution of the relaxation solved at each node. Computational results on both synthetic and real-world instances show that the proposed algorithm can solve instances approximately 20 times larger than those handled by general-purpose solvers.</description>

      <title>If CLIP Could Talk: Understanding Vision-Language Model Representations Through Their Preferred Concept Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works often assume that Vision-Language Model (VLM) representations are based on visual attributes like shape. However, it is unclear to what extent VLMs prioritize this information to represent concepts. We propose Extract and Explore (EX2), a novel approach to characterize textual features that are important for VLMs. EX2 uses reinforcement learning to align a large language model with VLM preferences and generates descriptions that incorporate features that are important for the VLM. Then, we inspect the descriptions to identify features that contribute to VLM representations. Using EX2, we find that spurious descriptions have a major role in VLM representations despite providing no helpful information, e.g., Click to enlarge photo of CONCEPT. More importantly, among informative descriptions, VLMs rely significantly on non-visual attributes like habitat (e.g., North America) to represent visual concepts. Also, our analysis reveals that different VLMs prioritize different attributes in their representations. Overall, we show that VLMs do not simply match images to scene descriptions and that non-visual or even spurious descriptions significantly influence their representations.</description>

      <title>Calib3D: Calibrating Model Preferences for Reliable 3D Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety-critical 3D scene understanding tasks necessitate not only accurate but also confident predictions from 3D perception models. This study introduces Calib3D, a pioneering effort to benchmark and scrutinize the reliability of 3D scene understanding models from an uncertainty estimation viewpoint. We comprehensively evaluate 28 state-of-the-art models across 10 diverse 3D datasets, uncovering insightful phenomena that cope with both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in 3D scene understanding. We discover that despite achieving impressive levels of accuracy, existing models frequently fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates -- a pitfall that critically undermines their applicability in safety-sensitive contexts. Through extensive analysis of key factors such as network capacity, LiDAR representations, rasterization resolutions, and 3D data augmentation techniques, we correlate these aspects directly with the model calibration efficacy. Furthermore, we introduce DeptS, a novel depth-aware scaling approach aimed at enhancing 3D model calibration. Extensive experiments across a wide range of configurations validate the superiority of our method. We hope this work could serve as a cornerstone for fostering reliable 3D scene understanding. Code and benchmark toolkit are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Separate, Dynamic and Differentiable (SMART) Pruner for Block/Output Channel Pruning on Computer Vision Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Block pruning, which eliminates contiguous blocks of weights, is a structural pruning method that can significantly enhance the performance of neural processing units (NPUs). In industrial applications, an ideal block pruning algorithm should meet three key requirements: (1) maintain high accuracy across diverse models and tasks, as machine learning deployments on edge devices are typically accuracy-critical; (2) offer precise control over resource constraints to facilitate user adoption; and (3) provide convergence guarantees to prevent performance instability. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing block pruning algorithm satisfies all three requirements simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce SMART (Separate, Dynamic, and Differentiable) pruning, a novel algorithm designed to address this gap. SMART leverages both weight and activation information to enhance accuracy, employs a differentiable top-k operator for precise control of resource constraints, and offers convergence guarantees under mild conditions. Extensive experiments involving seven models, four datasets, three different block types, and three computer vision tasks demonstrate that SMART pruning achieves state-of-the-art performance in block pruning.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence estimation from posterior samples with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method ($floZ$), based on normalizing flows, to estimate the Bayesian evidence (and its numerical uncertainty) from a pre-existing set of samples drawn from the unnormalized posterior distribution. We validate it on distributions whose evidence is known analytically, up to 15 parameter space dimensions, and compare with two state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the evidence: nested sampling (which computes the evidence as its main target) and a $k$-nearest-neighbors technique that produces evidence estimates from posterior samples. Provided representative samples from the target posterior are available, our method is more robust to posterior distributions with sharp features, especially in higher dimensions. For a simple multivariate Gaussian, we demonstrate its accuracy for up to 200 dimensions with $10^5$ posterior samples. $floZ$ has wide applicability, e.g., to estimate evidence from variational inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples, or any other method that delivers samples and their likelihood from the unnormalized posterior density. As a physical application, we use $floZ$ to compute the Bayes factor for the presence of the first overtone in the ringdown signal of the gravitational wave data of GW150914, finding good agreement with nested sampling.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Information Gain in Privacy-Aware Active Learning of Email Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Redacted emails satisfy most privacy requirements but they make it more difficult to detect anomalous emails that may be indicative of data exfiltration. In this paper we develop an enhanced method of Active Learning using an information gain maximizing heuristic, and we evaluate its effectiveness in a real world setting where only redacted versions of email could be labeled by human analysts due to privacy concerns. In the first case study we examined how Active Learning should be carried out. We found that model performance was best when a single highly skilled (in terms of the labelling task) analyst provided the labels. In the second case study we used confidence ratings to estimate the labeling uncertainty of analysts and then prioritized instances for labeling based on the expected information gain (the difference between model uncertainty and analyst uncertainty) that would be provided by labelling each instance. We found that the information maximization gain heuristic improved model performance over existing sampling methods for Active Learning. Based on the results obtained, we recommend that analysts should be screened, and possibly trained, prior to implementation of Active Learning in cybersecurity applications. We also recommend that the information gain maximizing sample method (based on expert confidence) should be used in early stages of Active Learning, providing that well-calibrated confidence can be obtained. We also note that the expertise of analysts should be assessed prior to Active Learning, as we found that analysts with lower labelling skill had poorly calibrated (over-) confidence in their labels.</description>

      <title>Deep Implicit Optimization enables Robust Learnable Features for Deformable Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning in Image Registration (DLIR) methods have been tremendously successful in image registration due to their speed and ability to incorporate weak label supervision at training time. However, existing DLIR methods forego many of the benefits and invariances of optimization methods. The lack of a task-specific inductive bias in DLIR methods leads to suboptimal performance, especially in the presence of domain shift. Our method aims to bridge this gap between statistical learning and optimization by explicitly incorporating optimization as a layer in a deep network. A deep network is trained to predict multi-scale dense feature images that are registered using a black box iterative optimization solver. This optimal warp is then used to minimize image and label alignment errors. By implicitly differentiating end-to-end through an iterative optimization solver, we explicitly exploit invariances of the correspondence matching problem induced by the optimization, while learning registration and label-aware features, and guaranteeing the warp functions to be a local minima of the registration objective in the feature space. Our framework shows excellent performance on in-domain datasets, and is agnostic to domain shift such as anisotropy and varying intensity profiles. For the first time, our method allows switching between arbitrary transformation representations (free-form to diffeomorphic) at test time with zero retraining. End-to-end feature learning also facilitates interpretability of features and arbitrary test-time regularization, which is not possible with existing DLIR methods.</description>

      <title>VGGHeads: 3D Multi Head Alignment with a Large-Scale Synthetic Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human head detection, keypoint estimation, and 3D head model fitting are essential tasks with many applications. However, traditional real-world datasets often suffer from bias, privacy, and ethical concerns, and they have been recorded in laboratory environments, which makes it difficult for trained models to generalize. Here, we introduce \method -- a large-scale synthetic dataset generated with diffusion models for human head detection and 3D mesh estimation. Our dataset comprises over 1 million high-resolution images, each annotated with detailed 3D head meshes, facial landmarks, and bounding boxes. Using this dataset, we introduce a new model architecture capable of simultaneous head detection and head mesh reconstruction from a single image in a single step. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve strong performance on real images. Furthermore, the versatility of our dataset makes it applicable across a broad spectrum of tasks, offering a general and comprehensive representation of human heads.</description>

      <title>Exploring RAG-based Vulnerability Augmentation with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting vulnerabilities is vital for software security, yet deep learning-based vulnerability detectors (DLVD) face a data shortage, which limits their effectiveness. Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across three vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using two LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer bootstrapping: A recipe for efficient agnostic tomography and magic estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of agnostic tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which has fidelity $\tau$ with some state in a given class $C$, find a state which has fidelity $\ge \tau - \epsilon$ with $\rho$. We give a new framework, stabilizer bootstrapping, for designing computationally efficient protocols for this task, and use this to get new agnostic tomography protocols for the following classes:
  Stabilizer states: We give a protocol that runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$, answering an open question posed by Grewal, Iyer, Kretschmer, Liang [43] and Anshu and Arunachalam [6]. Previous protocols ran in time $\mathrm{exp}(\Theta(n))$ or required $\tau&gt;\cos^2(\pi/8)$.
  States with stabilizer dimension $n - t$: We give a protocol that runs in time $n^3\cdot(2^t/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, extending recent work on learning quantum states prepared by circuits with few non-Clifford gates, which only applied in the realizable setting where $\tau = 1$ [33, 40, 49, 66].
  Discrete product states: If $C = K^{\otimes n}$ for some $\mu$-separated discrete set $K$ of single-qubit states, we give a protocol that runs in time $(n/\mu)^{O((1 + \log (1/\tau))/\mu)}/\epsilon^2$. This strictly generalizes a prior guarantee which applied to stabilizer product states [42]. For stabilizer product states, we give a further improved protocol that runs in time $(n^2/\epsilon^2)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$.
  As a corollary, we give the first protocol for estimating stabilizer fidelity, a standard measure of magic for quantum states, to error $\epsilon$ in $n^3 \mathrm{quasipoly}(1/\epsilon)$ time.</description>

      <title>Online SLA Decomposition: Enabling Real-Time Adaptation to Evolving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a network slice spans multiple technology domains, it is crucial for each domain to uphold the End-to-End (E2E) Service Level Agreement (SLA) associated with the slice. Consequently, the E2E SLA must be properly decomposed into partial SLAs that are assigned to each domain involved. In a network slice management system with a two-level architecture, comprising an E2E service orchestrator and local domain controllers, we consider that the orchestrator has access solely to historical data regarding the responses of local controllers to previous requests, and this information is used to construct a risk model for each domain. In this study, we extend our previous work by investigating the dynamic nature of real-world systems and introducing an online learning-decomposition framework to tackle the dynamicity. We propose a framework that periodically updates the risk models based on the most recent feedback. This approach leverages key components such as online gradient descent and FIFO memory buffers, which enhance the stability and robustness of the overall process. Our empirical study on an analytic model-based simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art static approach, providing more accurate and resilient SLA decomposition even under varying conditions and limited data scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process curves are multivariate finite time series data coming from manufacturing processes. This paper studies machine learning that detect drifts in process curve datasets. A theoretic framework to synthetically generate process curves in a controlled way is introduced in order to benchmark machine learning algorithms for process drift detection. An evaluation score, called the temporal area under the curve, is introduced, which allows to quantify how well machine learning models unveil curves belonging to drift segments. Finally, a benchmark study comparing popular machine learning approaches on synthetic data generated with the introduced framework is presented that shows that existing algorithms often struggle with datasets containing multiple drift segments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score prediction is crucial in evaluating realistic image sharpness based on collected informative features. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) have been developed and witnessed remarkable success in data fitting. This study introduces the Taylor series-based KAN (TaylorKAN). Then, different KANs are explored in four realistic image databases (BID2011, CID2013, CLIVE, and KonIQ-10k) to predict the scores by using 15 mid-level features and 2048 high-level features. Compared to support vector regression, results show that KANs are generally competitive or superior, and TaylorKAN is the best one when mid-level features are used. This is the first study to investigate KANs on image quality assessment that sheds some light on how to select and further improve KANs in related tasks.</description>

      <title>WaveletGPT: Wavelets Meet Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</description>

      <title>Developing a Thailand solar irradiance map using Himawari-8 satellite imageries and deep learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an online platform showing Thailand solar irradiance map every 30 minutes, available at https://www.cusolarforecast.com. The methodology for estimating global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across Thailand relies on cloud index extracted from Himawari-8 satellite imagery, Ineichen clear-sky model with locally-tuned Linke turbidity, and machine learning models. The methods take clear-sky irradiance, cloud index, re-analyzed GHI and temperature data from the MERRA-2 database, and date-time as inputs for GHI estimation models, including LightGBM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer. These are benchmarked with the estimate from a commercial service X by evaluation of 15-minute ground GHI data from 53 ground stations over 1.5 years during 2022-2023. The results show that the four models exhibit comparable overall MAE performance to the service X. The best model is LightGBM with an overall MAE of 78.58 W/sqm and RMSE of 118.97 W/sqm, while the service X achieves the lowest MAE, RMSE, and MBE in cloudy condition. Obtaining re-analyzed MERRA-2 data for the whole Thailand region is not economically feasible for deployment. When removing these features, the Informer model has a winning performance in MAE of 78.67 W/sqm. The obtained performance aligns with existing literature by taking the climate zone and time granularity of data into consideration. As the map shows an estimate of GHI over 93,000 grids with a frequent update, the paper also describes a computational framework for displaying the entire map. It tests the runtime performance of deep learning models in the GHI estimation process.</description>

      <title>Molmo and PixMo: Open Weights and Open Data for State-of-the-Art Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's most advanced vision-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models rely heavily on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs to achieve good performance, effectively distilling these closed VLMs into open ones. As a result, the community has been missing foundational knowledge about how to build performant VLMs from scratch. We present Molmo, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art in their class of openness. Our key contribution is a collection of new datasets called PixMo, including a dataset of highly detailed image captions for pre-training, a free-form image Q&amp;A dataset for fine-tuning, and an innovative 2D pointing dataset, all collected without the use of external VLMs. The success of our approach relies on careful modeling choices, a well-tuned training pipeline, and, most critically, the quality of our newly collected datasets. Our best-in-class 72B model not only outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models, but also outperforms larger proprietary models including Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro and Flash, second only to GPT-4o based on both academic benchmarks and on a large human evaluation. Our model weights, new datasets, and source code are available at https://molmo.allenai.org/blog.</description>

      <title>HydraViT: Stacking Heads for a Scalable ViT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The architecture of Vision Transformers (ViTs), particularly the Multi-head Attention (MHA) mechanism, imposes substantial hardware demands. Deploying ViTs on devices with varying constraints, such as mobile phones, requires multiple models of different sizes. However, this approach has limitations, such as training and storing each required model separately. This paper introduces HydraViT, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by stacking attention heads to achieve a scalable ViT. By repeatedly changing the size of the embedded dimensions throughout each layer and their corresponding number of attention heads in MHA during training, HydraViT induces multiple subnetworks. Thereby, HydraViT achieves adaptability across a wide spectrum of hardware environments while maintaining performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of HydraViT in achieving a scalable ViT with up to 10 subnetworks, covering a wide range of resource constraints. HydraViT achieves up to 5 p.p. more accuracy with the same GMACs and up to 7 p.p. more accuracy with the same throughput on ImageNet-1K compared to the baselines, making it an effective solution for scenarios where hardware availability is diverse or varies over time.

      <title>A Model-Constrained Discontinuous Galerkin Network (DGNet) for Compressible Euler Equations with Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time accurate solutions of large-scale complex dynamical systems are critically needed for control, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and decision-making in practical engineering and science applications, particularly in digital twin contexts. In this work, we develop a model-constrained discontinuous Galerkin Network (DGNet) approach, a significant extension to our previous work [Model-constrained Tagent Slope Learning Approach for Dynamical Systems], for compressible Euler equations with out-of-distribution generalization. The core of DGNet is the synergy of several key strategies: (i) leveraging time integration schemes to capture temporal correlation and taking advantage of neural network speed for computation time reduction; (ii) employing a model-constrained approach to ensure the learned tangent slope satisfies governing equations; (iii) utilizing a GNN-inspired architecture where edges represent Riemann solver surrogate models and nodes represent volume integration correction surrogate models, enabling capturing discontinuity capability, aliasing error reduction, and mesh discretization generalizability; (iv) implementing the input normalization technique that allows surrogate models to generalize across different initial conditions, geometries, meshes, boundary conditions, and solution orders; and (v) incorporating a data randomization technique that not only implicitly promotes agreement between surrogate models and true numerical models up to second-order derivatives, ensuring long-term stability and prediction capacity, but also serves as a data generation engine during training, leading to enhanced generalization on unseen data. To validate the effectiveness, stability, and generalizability of our novel DGNet approach, we present comprehensive numerical results for 1D and 2D compressible Euler equation problems.</description>

      <title>Group Distributionally Robust Optimization can Suppress Class Imbalance Effect in Network Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet services have led to the eruption of network traffic, and machine learning on these Internet data has become an indispensable tool, especially when the application is risk-sensitive. This paper focuses on network traffic classification in the presence of class imbalance, which fundamentally and ubiquitously exists in Internet data analysis. This existence of class imbalance mostly drifts the optimal decision boundary, resulting in a less optimal solution for machine learning models. To alleviate the effect, we propose to design strategies for alleviating the class imbalance through the lens of group distributionally robust optimization. Our approach iteratively updates the non-parametric weights for separate classes and optimizes the learning model by minimizing reweighted losses. We interpret the optimization process from a Stackelberg game and perform extensive experiments on typical benchmarks. Results show that our approach can not only suppress the negative effect of class imbalance but also improve the comprehensive performance in prediction.</description>

      <title>Improving Fine-Grained Control via Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While many diffusion models perform well when controlling for particular aspect among style, character, and interaction, they struggle with fine-grained control due to dataset limitations and intricate model architecture design. This paper introduces a novel algorithm, Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models (AMDM), which synthesizes features from multiple diffusion models into a specified model, activating specific features for fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that AMDM significantly improves fine-grained control without training, proving its effectiveness. Additionally, it reveals that diffusion models initially focus on features such as position, attributes, and style, with later stages improving generation quality and consistency. AMDM offers a new perspective for tackling the challenges of fine-grained conditional control generation in diffusion models: We can fully utilize existing or develop new conditional diffusion models that control specific aspects, and then aggregate them using AMDM algorithm. This eliminates the need for constructing complex datasets, designing intricate model architectures, and incurring high training costs.

      <title>Representation Alignment for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Easier Than You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the denoising process in (generative) diffusion models can induce meaningful (discriminative) representations inside the model, though the quality of these representations still lags behind those learned through recent self-supervised learning methods. We argue that one main bottleneck in training large-scale diffusion models for generation lies in effectively learning these representations. Moreover, training can be made easier by incorporating high-quality external visual representations, rather than relying solely on the diffusion models to learn them independently. We study this by introducing a straightforward regularization called REPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input hidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations obtained from external, pretrained visual encoders. The results are striking: our simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality when applied to popular diffusion and flow-based transformers, such as DiTs and SiTs. For instance, our method can speed up SiT training by over 17.5$\times$, matching the performance (without classifier-free guidance) of a SiT-XL model trained for 7M steps in less than 400K steps. In terms of final generation quality, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results of FID=1.42 using classifier-free guidance with the guidance interval.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Personalization in FedProx: A Fine-grained Analysis on Statistical Accuracy and Communication Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FedProx is a simple yet effective federated learning method that enables model personalization via regularization. Despite remarkable success in practice, a rigorous analysis of how such a regularization provably improves the statistical accuracy of each client's local model hasn't been fully established. Setting the regularization strength heuristically presents a risk, as an inappropriate choice may even degrade accuracy. This work fills in the gap by analyzing the effect of regularization on statistical accuracy, thereby providing a theoretical guideline for setting the regularization strength for achieving personalization. We prove that by adaptively choosing the regularization strength under different statistical heterogeneity, FedProx can consistently outperform pure local training and achieve a \textit{minimax-optimal} statistical rate. In addition, to shed light on resource allocation, we design an algorithm, provably showing that stronger personalization reduces communication complexity without increasing the computation cost overhead. Finally, our theory is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets and its generalizability is verified in a non-convex setting.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Comfort Zone: Emerging Solutions to Overcome Challenges in Integrating LLMs into Software Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into software products across diverse industries, enhancing user experiences, but at the same time introducing numerous challenges for developers. Unique characteristics of LLMs force developers, who are accustomed to traditional software development and evaluation, out of their comfort zones as the LLM components shatter standard assumptions about software systems. This study explores the emerging solutions that software developers are adopting to navigate the encountered challenges. Leveraging a mixed-method research, including 26 interviews and a survey with 332 responses, the study identifies 19 emerging solutions regarding quality assurance that practitioners across several product teams at Microsoft are exploring. The findings provide valuable insights that can guide the development and evaluation of LLM-based products more broadly in the face of these challenges.</description>

      <title>COOL: Efficient and Reliable Chain-Oriented Objective Logic with Neural Networks Feedback Control for Program Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Program synthesis methods, whether formal or neural-based, lack fine-grained control and flexible modularity, which limits their adaptation to complex software development. These limitations stem from rigid Domain-Specific Language (DSL) frameworks and neural network incorrect predictions. To this end, we propose the Chain of Logic (CoL), which organizes the synthesis process into an activity flow and provides heuristic control to guide the process. Furthermore, by integrating neural networks with libraries and introducing a Neural Network Feedback Control (NNFC) mechanism, our approach modularizes synthesis and mitigates the impact of neural network mispredictions. Experiments on relational and symbolic synthesis tasks show that CoL significantly enhances the efficiency and reliability of DSL program synthesis across multiple metrics. Specifically, CoL improves accuracy by 70% while reducing tree operations by 91% and time by 95%. Additionally, NNFC further boosts accuracy by 6%, with a 64% reduction in tree operations under challenging conditions such as insufficient training data, increased difficulty, and multidomain synthesis. These improvements confirm COOL as a highly efficient and reliable program synthesis framework.</description>

      <title>A Complexity-Based Theory of Compositionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositionality is believed to be fundamental to intelligence. In humans, it underlies the structure of thought, language, and higher-level reasoning. In AI, compositional representations can enable a powerful form of out-of-distribution generalization, in which a model systematically adapts to novel combinations of known concepts. However, while we have strong intuitions about what compositionality is, there currently exists no formal definition for it that is measurable and mathematical. Here, we propose such a definition, which we call representational compositionality, that accounts for and extends our intuitions about compositionality. The definition is conceptually simple, quantitative, grounded in algorithmic information theory, and applicable to any representation. Intuitively, representational compositionality states that a compositional representation satisfies three properties. First, it must be expressive. Second, it must be possible to re-describe the representation as a function of discrete symbolic sequences with re-combinable parts, analogous to sentences in natural language. Third, the function that relates these symbolic sequences to the representation, analogous to semantics in natural language, must be simple. Through experiments on both synthetic and real world data, we validate our definition of compositionality and show how it unifies disparate intuitions from across the literature in both AI and cognitive science. We also show that representational compositionality, while theoretically intractable, can be readily estimated using standard deep learning tools. Our definition has the potential to inspire the design of novel, theoretically-driven models that better capture the mechanisms of compositional thought.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Infinite Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent is a classic algorithm that has gained great popularity especially in the last decades as the most common approach for training models in machine learning. While the algorithm has been well-studied when stochastic gradients are assumed to have a finite variance, there is significantly less research addressing its theoretical properties in the case of infinite variance gradients. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic behavior of stochastic gradient descent in the context of infinite variance stochastic gradients, assuming that the stochastic gradient is regular varying with index $\alpha\in(1,2)$. The closest result in this context was established in 1969 , in the one-dimensional case and assuming that stochastic gradients belong to a more restrictive class of distributions. We extend it to the multidimensional case, covering a broader class of infinite variance distributions. As we show, the asymptotic distribution of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm can be characterized as the stationary distribution of a suitably defined Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by an appropriate stable L\'evy process. Additionally, we explore the applications of these results in linear regression and logistic regression models.</description>

      <title>Using Platt's scaling for calibration after undersampling -- limitations and how to address them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When modelling data where the response is dichotomous and highly imbalanced, response-based sampling where a subset of the majority class is retained (i.e., undersampling) is often used to create more balanced training datasets prior to modelling. However, the models fit to this undersampled data, which we refer to as base models, generate predictions that are severely biased. There are several calibration methods that can be used to combat this bias, one of which is Platt's scaling. Here, a logistic regression model is used to model the relationship between the base model's original predictions and the response. Despite its popularity for calibrating models after undersampling, Platt's scaling was not designed for this purpose. Our work presents what we believe is the first detailed study focused on the validity of using Platt's scaling to calibrate models after undersampling. We show analytically, as well as via a simulation study and a case study, that Platt's scaling should not be used for calibration after undersampling without critical thought. If Platt's scaling would have been able to successfully calibrate the base model had it been trained on the entire dataset (i.e., without undersampling), then Platt's scaling might be appropriate for calibration after undersampling. If this is not the case, we recommend a modified version of Platt's scaling that fits a logistic generalized additive model to the logit of the base model's predictions, as it is both theoretically motivated and performed well across the settings considered in our study.</description>

      <title>On the Benefits of Active Data Collection in Operator Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate active data collection strategies for operator learning when the target operator is linear and the input functions are drawn from a mean-zero stochastic process with continuous covariance kernels. With an active data collection strategy, we establish an error convergence rate in terms of the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the covariance kernel. Thus, with sufficiently rapid eigenvalue decay of the covariance kernels, arbitrarily fast error convergence rates can be achieved. This contrasts with the passive (i.i.d.) data collection strategies, where the convergence rate is never faster than $\sim n^{-1}$. In fact, for our setting, we establish a \emph{non-vanishing} lower bound for any passive data collection strategy, regardless of the eigenvalues decay rate of the covariance kernel. Overall, our results show the benefit of active over passive data collection strategies in operator learning.</description>

      <title>HoPE: A Novel Positional Encoding Without Long-Term Decay for Enhanced Context Awareness and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many positional encodings (PEs) are designed to exhibit long-term decay, based on an entrenched and long-standing inductive opinion: tokens farther away from the current position carry less relevant information. We argue that long-term decay is outdated in the era of LLMs, as LLMs are now applied to tasks demanding precise retrieval of in-context information from arbitrary positions. Firstly, we present empirical analyses on various PEs, demonstrating that models inherently learn attention with only a local-decay pattern while forming a U-shape pattern globally, contradicting the principle of long-term decay. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of rotary position encoding (RoPE, a prevalent relative positional encoding in LLMs), and found that the U-shape attention is caused by some learned components, which are also the key factor limiting RoPE's expressiveness and extrapolation.Inspired by these insights, we propose High-frequency rotary Position Encoding (HoPE). HoPE replaces the specific components in RoPE with position-independent ones, retaining only high-frequency signals, which also breaks the principle of long-term decay in theory. HoPE achieves two major advantages: (1) Without constraints imposed by long-term decay, contradictory factors that limit spontaneous attention optimization and model extrapolation performance are removed. (2) Components representing positions and semantics are are optimized. These enhances model's context awareness and extrapolation, as validated by extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample performance of the maximum likelihood estimator in logistic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logistic regression is a classical model for describing the probabilistic dependence of binary responses to multivariate covariates. We consider the predictive performance of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for logistic regression, assessed in terms of logistic risk. We consider two questions: first, that of the existence of the MLE (which occurs when the dataset is not linearly separated), and second that of its accuracy when it exists. These properties depend on both the dimension of covariates and on the signal strength. In the case of Gaussian covariates and a well-specified logistic model, we obtain sharp non-asymptotic guarantees for the existence and excess logistic risk of the MLE. We then generalize these results in two ways: first, to non-Gaussian covariates satisfying a certain two-dimensional margin condition, and second to the general case of statistical learning with a possibly misspecified logistic model. Finally, we consider the case of a Bernoulli design, where the behavior of the MLE is highly sensitive to the parameter direction.</description>

      <title>SG-I2V: Self-Guided Trajectory Control in Image-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods for image-to-video generation have achieved impressive, photo-realistic quality. However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge. Our zero-shot method outperforms unsupervised baselines while significantly narrowing down the performance gap with supervised models in terms of visual quality and motion fidelity.</description>

      <title>Iterative Reweighted Framework Based Algorithms for Sparse Linear Regression with Generalized Elastic Net Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elastic net penalty is frequently employed in high-dimensional statistics for parameter regression and variable selection. It is particularly beneficial compared to lasso when the number of predictors greatly surpasses the number of observations. However, empirical evidence has shown that the $\ell_q$-norm penalty (where $0 &lt; q &lt; 1$) often provides better regression compared to the $\ell_1$-norm penalty, demonstrating enhanced robustness in various scenarios. In this paper, we explore a generalized elastic net model that employs a $\ell_r$-norm (where $r \geq 1$) in loss function to accommodate various types of noise, and employs a $\ell_q$-norm (where $0 &lt; q &lt; 1$) to replace the $\ell_1$-norm in elastic net penalty. Theoretically, we establish the computable lower bounds for the nonzero entries of the generalized first-order stationary points of the proposed generalized elastic net model. For implementation, we develop two efficient algorithms based on the locally Lipschitz continuous $\epsilon$-approximation to $\ell_q$-norm. The first algorithm employs an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), while the second utilizes a proximal majorization-minimization method (PMM), where the subproblems are addressed using the semismooth Newton method (SNN). We also perform extensive numerical experiments with both simulated and real data, showing that both algorithms demonstrate superior performance. Notably, the PMM-SSN is efficient than ADMM, even though the latter provides a simpler implementation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fluorescence Lifetime Parameter Estimation Accuracy with Differential Transformer Based Deep Learning Model Incorporating Pixelwise Instrument Response Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLI) is a critical molecular imaging modality that provides unique information about the tissue microenvironment, which is invaluable for biomedical applications. FLI operates by acquiring and analyzing photon time-of-arrival histograms to extract quantitative parameters associated with temporal fluorescence decay. These histograms are influenced by the intrinsic properties of the fluorophore, instrument parameters, time-of-flight distributions associated with pixel-wise variations in the topographic and optical characteristics of the sample. Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have enabled improved fluorescence lifetime parameter estimation. However, existing models are primarily designed for planar surface samples, limiting their applicability in translational scenarios involving complex surface profiles, such as \textit{in-vivo} whole-animal or imaged guided surgical applications. To address this limitation, we present MFliNet (Macroscopic FLI Network), a novel DL architecture that integrates the Instrument Response Function (IRF) as an additional input alongside experimental photon time-of-arrival histograms. Leveraging the capabilities of a Differential Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, MFliNet effectively focuses on critical input features, such as variations in photon time-of-arrival distributions. We evaluate MFliNet using rigorously designed tissue-mimicking phantoms and preclinical in-vivo cancer xenograft models. Our results demonstrate the model's robustness and suitability for complex macroscopic FLI applications, offering new opportunities for advanced biomedical imaging in diverse and challenging settings.</description>

      <title>R-MTLLMF: Resilient Multi-Task Large Language Model Fusion at the Wireless Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-task large language models (MTLLMs) are important for many applications at the wireless edge, where users demand specialized models to handle multiple tasks efficiently. However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive, particularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model fusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining fine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of enabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTLMs via tasks vectors is studied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end, first the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is investigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement error and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it is directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors, thereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM fusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under adversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then compared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the impact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision LLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and significantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios. The results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a holistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.</description>

      <title>ELEMENTAL: Interactive Learning from Demonstrations and Vision-Language Models for Reward Design in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated compelling performance in robotic tasks, but its success often hinges on the design of complex, ad hoc reward functions. Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) could enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However, LLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize poorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem properly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a novel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user demonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By incorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only task specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to balance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally. ELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to improve feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results demonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and achieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting its robustness in LfD.</description>

      <title>Hallo3: Highly Dynamic and Realistic Portrait Image Animation with Diffusion Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methodologies for animating portrait images face significant challenges, particularly in handling non-frontal perspectives, rendering dynamic objects around the portrait, and generating immersive, realistic backgrounds. In this paper, we introduce the first application of a pretrained transformer-based video generative model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and generates highly dynamic, realistic videos for portrait animation, effectively addressing these challenges. The adoption of a new video backbone model makes previous U-Net-based methods for identity maintenance, audio conditioning, and video extrapolation inapplicable. To address this limitation, we design an identity reference network consisting of a causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers, ensuring consistent facial identity across video sequences. Additionally, we investigate various speech audio conditioning and motion frame mechanisms to enable the generation of continuous video driven by speech audio. Our method is validated through experiments on benchmark and newly proposed wild datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods in generating realistic portraits characterized by diverse orientations within dynamic and immersive scenes. Further visualizations and the source code are available at: https://fudan-generative-vision.github.io/hallo3/.</description>

      <title>Yi-Lightning Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.</description>

      <title>Negative Token Merging: Image-based Adversarial Feature Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-based adversarial guidance using a negative prompt has emerged as a widely adopted approach to steer diffusion models away from producing undesired concepts. While useful, performing adversarial guidance using text alone can be insufficient to capture complex visual concepts or avoid specific visual elements like copyrighted characters. In this paper, for the first time we explore an alternate modality in this direction by performing adversarial guidance directly using visual features from a reference image or other images in a batch. We introduce negative token merging (NegToMe), a simple but effective training-free approach which performs adversarial guidance through images by selectively pushing apart matching visual features between reference and generated images during the reverse diffusion process. By simply adjusting the used reference, NegToMe enables a diverse range of applications. Notably, when using other images in same batch as reference, we find that NegToMe significantly enhances output diversity (e.g., racial, gender, visual) by guiding features of each image away from others. Similarly, when used w.r.t. copyrighted reference images, NegToMe reduces visual similarity to copyrighted content by 34.57%. NegToMe is simple to implement using just few-lines of code, uses only marginally higher (&lt;4%) inference time and is compatible with different diffusion architectures, including those like Flux, which don't natively support the use of a negative prompt.

      <title>Kernel-Based Optimal Control: An Infinitesimal Generator Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems using infinitesimal generator learning within infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns the diffusion operator of a controlled Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. This operator models the continuous-time evolution of the probability measure of the control system's state. We demonstrate that this approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven solution to the optimal control problem. Furthermore, our statistical learning framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled forward infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.</description>

      <title>HERO: Hint-Based Efficient and Reliable Query Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model for learned query optimization which provides query hints leading to better execution plans. The model addresses the three key challenges in learned hint-based query optimization: reliable hint recommendation (ensuring non-degradation of query latency), efficient hint exploration, and fast inference. We provide an in-depth analysis of existing NN-based approaches to hint-based optimization and experimentally confirm the named challenges for them. Our alternative solution consists of a new inference schema based on an ensemble of context-aware models and a graph storage for reliable hint suggestion and fast inference, and a budget-controlled training procedure with a local search algorithm that solves the issue of exponential search space exploration. In experiments on standard benchmarks, our model demonstrates optimization capability close to the best achievable with coarse-grained hints. Controlling the degree of parallelism (query dop) in addition to operator-related hints enables our model to achieve 3x latency improvement on JOB benchmark which sets a new standard for optimization. Our model is interpretable and easy to debug, which is particularly important for deployment in production.</description>

      <title>What should a neuron aim for? Designing local objective functions based on information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of the individual neurons is often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. We here show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e. feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies.</description>

      <title>Memory-efficient Continual Learning with Neural Collapse Contrastive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has significantly improved representation quality, enhancing knowledge transfer across tasks in continual learning (CL). However, catastrophic forgetting remains a key challenge, as contrastive based methods primarily focus on "soft relationships" or "softness" between samples, which shift with changing data distributions and lead to representation overlap across tasks. Recently, the newly identified Neural Collapse phenomenon has shown promise in CL by focusing on "hard relationships" or "hardness" between samples and fixed prototypes. However, this approach overlooks "softness", crucial for capturing intra-class variability, and this rigid focus can also pull old class representations toward current ones, increasing forgetting. Building on these insights, we propose Focal Neural Collapse Contrastive (FNC2), a novel representation learning loss that effectively balances both soft and hard relationships. Additionally, we introduce the Hardness-Softness Distillation (HSD) loss to progressively preserve the knowledge gained from these relationships across tasks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in minimizing memory reliance. Remarkably, even without the use of memory, our approach rivals rehearsal-based methods, offering a compelling solution for data privacy concerns.</description>

      <title>Sinkhorn Algorithm for Sequentially Composed Optimal Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sinkhorn algorithm is the de-facto standard approximation algorithm for optimal transport, which has been applied to a variety of applications, including image processing and natural language processing. In theory, the proof of its convergence follows from the convergence of the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm for the matrix scaling problem, and Altschuler et al. show that its worst-case time complexity is in near-linear time. Very recently, sequentially composed optimal transports were proposed by Watanabe and Isobe as a hierarchical extension of optimal transports. In this paper, we present an efficient approximation algorithm, namely Sinkhorn algorithm for sequentially composed optimal transports, for its entropic regularization. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm, namely (i) its exponential convergence to the optimal solution with respect to the Hilbert pseudometric, and (ii) a worst-case complexity analysis for the case of one sequential composition.</description>

      <title>Continual Low-Rank Scaled Dot-product Attention</title>

Abstract: Transformers are widely used for their ability to capture data relations in sequence processing, with great success for a wide range of static tasks. However, the computational and memory footprint of their main component, i.e., the Scaled Dot-product Attention, is commonly overlooked. This makes their adoption in applications involving stream data processing with constraints in response latency, computational and memory resources infeasible. Some works have proposed methods to lower the computational cost of transformers, i.e. low-rank approximations, sparsity in attention, and efficient formulations for Continual Inference. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation of the Scaled Dot-product Attention based on the Nystr\"om approximation that is suitable for Continual Inference. In experiments on Online Audio Classification and Online Action Detection tasks, the proposed Continual Scaled Dot-product Attention can lower the number of operations by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the original Transformers while retaining the predictive performance of competing models.</description>

      <title>Tight PAC-Bayesian Risk Certificates for Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03486</link>

Abstract: Contrastive representation learning is a modern paradigm for learning representations of unlabeled data via augmentations -- precisely, contrastive models learn to embed semantically similar pairs of samples (positive pairs) closer than independently drawn samples (negative samples). In spite of its empirical success and widespread use in foundation models, statistical theory for contrastive learning remains less explored. Recent works have developed generalization error bounds for contrastive losses, but the resulting risk certificates are either vacuous (certificates based on Rademacher complexity or $f$-divergence) or require strong assumptions about samples that are unreasonable in practice. The present paper develops non-vacuous PAC-Bayesian risk certificates for contrastive representation learning, considering the practical considerations of the popular SimCLR framework. Notably, we take into account that SimCLR reuses positive pairs of augmented data as negative samples for other data, thereby inducing strong dependence and making classical PAC or PAC-Bayesian bounds inapplicable. We further refine existing bounds on the downstream classification loss by incorporating SimCLR-specific factors, including data augmentation and temperature scaling, and derive risk certificates for the contrastive zero-one risk. The resulting bounds for contrastive loss and downstream prediction are much tighter than those of previous risk certificates, as demonstrated by experiments on CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>A Bidirectional Siamese Recurrent Neural Network for Accurate Gait Recognition Using Body Landmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gait recognition is a significant biometric technique for person identification, particularly in scenarios where other physiological biometrics are impractical or ineffective. In this paper, we address the challenges associated with gait recognition and present a novel approach to improve its accuracy and reliability. The proposed method leverages advanced techniques, including sequential gait landmarks obtained through the Mediapipe pose estimation model, Procrustes analysis for alignment, and a Siamese biGRU-dualStack Neural Network architecture for capturing temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments were conducted on large-scale cross-view datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high recognition accuracy compared to other models. The model demonstrated accuracies of 95.7%, 94.44%, 87.71%, and 86.6% on CASIA-B, SZU RGB-D, OU-MVLP, and Gait3D datasets respectively. The results highlight the potential applications of the proposed method in various practical domains, indicating its significant contribution to the field of gait recognition.</description>
