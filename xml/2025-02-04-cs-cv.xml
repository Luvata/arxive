      <title>STAMP: Scalable Task And Model-agnostic Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception is crucial for autonomous driving, but single-agent perception is often constrained by sensors' physical limitations, leading to degraded performance under severe occlusion, adverse weather conditions, and when detecting distant objects. Multi-agent collaborative perception offers a solution, yet challenges arise when integrating heterogeneous agents with varying model architectures. To address these challenges, we propose STAMP, a scalable task- and model-agnostic, collaborative perception pipeline for heterogeneous agents. STAMP utilizes lightweight adapter-reverter pairs to transform Bird's Eye View (BEV) features between agent-specific and shared protocol domains, enabling efficient feature sharing and fusion. This approach minimizes computational overhead, enhances scalability, and preserves model security. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate STAMP's comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art models with significantly reduced computational costs. As a first-of-its-kind task- and model-agnostic framework, STAMP aims to advance research in scalable and secure mobility systems towards Level 5 autonomy.

      <title>Vision Aided Channel Prediction for Vehicular Communications: A Case Study of Received Power Prediction Using RGB Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The communication scenarios and channel characteristics of 6G will be more complex and difficult to characterize. Conventional methods for channel prediction face challenges in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, practicality, and generalizability. Additionally, they often fail to effectively leverage environmental features. Within the framework of integration communication and artificial intelligence as a pivotal development vision for 6G, it is imperative to achieve intelligent prediction of channel characteristics. Vision-aided methods have been employed in various wireless communication tasks, excluding channel prediction, and have demonstrated enhanced efficiency and performance. In this paper, we propose a vision-aided two-stage model for channel prediction in millimeter wave vehicular communication scenarios, realizing accurate received power prediction utilizing solely RGB images. Firstly, we obtain original images of propagation environment through an RGB camera. Secondly, three typical computer vision methods including object detection, instance segmentation and binary mask are employed for environmental information extraction from original images in stage 1, and prediction of received power based on processed images is implemented in stage 2. Pre-trained YOLOv8 and ResNets are used in stages 1 and 2, respectively, and fine-tuned on datasets. Finally, we conduct five experiments to evaluate the performance of proposed model, demonstrating its feasibility, accuracy and generalization capabilities. The model proposed in this paper offers novel solutions for achieving intelligent channel prediction in vehicular communications.</description>

      <title>FAAGC: Feature Augmentation on Adaptive Geodesic Curve Based on the shape space theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have been widely applied across various domains and industries. However, many fields still face challenges due to limited and insufficient data. This paper proposes a Feature Augmentation on Adaptive Geodesic Curve (FAAGC) method in the pre-shape space to increase data. In the pre-shape space, objects with identical shapes lie on a great circle. Thus, we project deep model representations into the pre-shape space and construct a geodesic curve, i.e., an arc of a great circle, for each class. Feature augmentation is then performed by sampling along these geodesic paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAAGC improves classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and generalizes well across various feature types.</description>

      <title>Three Laws of Statistical Linguistics Emerging in images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images, as a product evolving alongside civilization, develop similarly to natural languages with the advancement of civilization. Not only are images abundant in daily life, but are also influenced by technology in shaping their forms, embodying various characteristics as they evolve in time. Language is a sequence of symbols that represents thoughts. While a written language is typically associated with the close integration of text and sound, as a combination of visual symbols and perception, the communicative power of image is no less significant. This is especially notable since 60% of the sensory input received by our central nervous system comes from vision. Given the symbolic system inherent in images, we are curious whether images can also exhibit the laws of statistical linguistics. To explore this, we begin with the relationship between human thought and visual perception to decode how images are formed by the latter mechanism. Building upon previous studies that established the high correlation between pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and the human visual system, we use the VGG-19 to define words via each kernel and calculate the number of pixels with grayscale values greater than 90%. By (a) ranking words frequency, (b) randomizing the order of kernel appearances and performing the same word count accumulation, and (c) summing the word counts layer by layer, we are surprised to find that Zipf's, Heaps', and Benford's laws of statistical linguistics also exist in the words that comprises the text representing different images.</description>

      <title>VLMaterial: Procedural Material Generation with Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Procedural materials, represented as functional node graphs, are ubiquitous in computer graphics for photorealistic material appearance design. They allow users to perform intuitive and precise editing to achieve desired visual appearances. However, creating a procedural material given an input image requires professional knowledge and significant effort. In this work, we leverage the ability to convert procedural materials into standard Python programs and fine-tune a large pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to generate such programs from input images. To enable effective fine-tuning, we also contribute an open-source procedural material dataset and propose to perform program-level augmentation by prompting another pre-trained large language model (LLM). Through extensive evaluation, we show that our method outperforms previous methods on both synthetic and real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Deformable Beta Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced radiance field reconstruction by enabling real-time rendering. However, its reliance on Gaussian kernels for geometry and low-order Spherical Harmonics (SH) for color encoding limits its ability to capture complex geometries and diverse colors. We introduce Deformable Beta Splatting (DBS), a deformable and compact approach that enhances both geometry and color representation. DBS replaces Gaussian kernels with deformable Beta Kernels, which offer bounded support and adaptive frequency control to capture fine geometric details with higher fidelity while achieving better memory efficiency. In addition, we extended the Beta Kernel to color encoding, which facilitates improved representation of diffuse and specular components, yielding superior results compared to SH-based methods. Furthermore, Unlike prior densification techniques that depend on Gaussian properties, we mathematically prove that adjusting regularized opacity alone ensures distribution-preserved Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), independent of the splatting kernel type. Experimental results demonstrate that DBS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while utilizing only 45% of the parameters and rendering 1.5x faster than 3DGS-based methods. Notably, for the first time, splatting-based methods outperform state-of-the-art Neural Radiance Fields, highlighting the superior performance and efficiency of DBS for real-time radiance field rendering.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Depth Perception in Foveated Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The true vision for real-time virtual and augmented reality is reproducing our visual reality in its entirety on immersive displays. To this end, foveated rendering leverages the limitations of spatial acuity in human peripheral vision to allocate computational resources to the fovea while reducing quality in the periphery. Such methods are often derived from studies on the spatial resolution of the human visual system and its ability to perceive blur in the periphery, enabling the potential for high spatial quality in real-time. However, the effects of blur on other visual cues that depend on luminance contrast, such as depth, remain largely unexplored. It is critical to understand this interplay, as accurate depth representation is a fundamental aspect of visual realism. In this paper, we present the first evaluation exploring the effects of foveated rendering on stereoscopic depth perception. We design a psychovisual experiment to quantitatively study the effects of peripheral blur on depth perception. Our analysis demonstrates that stereoscopic acuity remains unaffected (or even improves) by high levels of peripheral blur. Based on our studies, we derive a simple perceptual model that determines the amount of foveation that does not affect stereoacuity. Furthermore, we analyze the model in the context of common foveation practices reported in literature. The findings indicate that foveated rendering does not impact stereoscopic depth perception, and stereoacuity remains unaffected up to 2x stronger foveation than commonly used. Finally, we conduct a validation experiment and show that our findings hold for complex natural stimuli.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships in materials with robust features from foundational vision transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an emerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOV2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Image Velocimetry using Direct Displacement Field estimation with Neural Networks for Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important tool for experimental fluids mechanics research is Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Several robust methodologies have been proposed to perform the estimation of velocity field from the images, however, alternative methods are still needed to increase the spatial resolution of the results. This work presents a novel approach for estimating fluid flow fields using neural networks and the optical flow equation to predict displacement vectors between sequential images. The result is a continuous representation of the displacement, that can be evaluated on the full spatial resolution of the image. The methodology was validated on synthetic and experimental images. Accurate results were obtained in terms of the estimation of instantaneous velocity fields, and of the determined time average turbulence quantities and power spectral density. The methodology proposed differs of previous attempts of using machine learning for this task: it does not require any previous training, and could be directly used in any pair of images.</description>

      <title>DebiasPI: Inference-time Debiasing by Prompt Iteration of a Text-to-Image Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethical intervention prompting has emerged as a tool to counter demographic biases of text-to-image generative AI models. Existing solutions either require to retrain the model or struggle to generate images that reflect desired distributions on gender and race. We propose an inference-time process called DebiasPI for Debiasing-by-Prompt-Iteration that provides prompt intervention by enabling the user to control the distributions of individuals' demographic attributes in image generation. DebiasPI keeps track of which attributes have been generated either by probing the internal state of the model or by using external attribute classifiers. Its control loop guides the text-to-image model to select not yet sufficiently represented attributes, With DebiasPI, we were able to create images with equal representations of race and gender that visualize challenging concepts of news headlines. We also experimented with the attributes age, body type, profession, and skin tone, and measured how attributes change when our intervention prompt targets the distribution of an unrelated attribute type. We found, for example, if the text-to-image model is asked to balance racial representation, gender representation improves but the skin tone becomes less diverse. Attempts to cover a wide range of skin colors with various intervention prompts showed that the model struggles to generate the palest skin tones. We conducted various ablation studies, in which we removed DebiasPI's attribute control, that reveal the model's propensity to generate young, male characters. It sometimes visualized career success by generating two-panel images with a pre-success dark-skinned person becoming light-skinned with success, or switching gender from pre-success female to post-success male, thus further motivating ethical intervention prompting with DebiasPI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a mobile-based solution that enhances online shoe shopping through 3D modeling and Augmented Reality (AR), leveraging the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Addressing the limitations of static 2D images, the framework generates realistic 3D shoe models from 2D images, achieving an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 0.32, and enables immersive AR interactions via smartphones. A custom shoe segmentation dataset of 3120 images was created, with the best-performing segmentation model achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.95. This paper demonstrates the potential of 3D modeling and AR to revolutionize online shopping by offering realistic virtual interactions, with applicability across broader fashion categories.</description>

      <title>Image, Text, and Speech Data Augmentation using Multimodal LLMs for Deep Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past five years, research has shifted from traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) , including multimodality, for data augmentation to enhance generalization, and combat overfitting in training deep convolutional neural networks. However, while existing surveys predominantly focus on ML and DL techniques or limited modalities (text or images), a gap remains in addressing the latest advancements and multi-modal applications of LLM-based methods. This survey fills that gap by exploring recent literature utilizing multimodal LLMs to augment image, text, and audio data, offering a comprehensive understanding of these processes. We outlined various methods employed in the LLM-based image, text and speech augmentation, and discussed the limitations identified in current approaches. Additionally, we identified potential solutions to these limitations from the literature to enhance the efficacy of data augmentation practices using multimodal LLMs. This survey serves as a foundation for future research, aiming to refine and expand the use of multimodal LLMs in enhancing dataset quality and diversity for deep learning applications.

      <title>High-Accuracy ECG Image Interpretation using Parameter-Efficient LoRA Fine-Tuning with Multimodal LLaMA 3.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is a cornerstone of cardiac diagnostics. This paper explores a practical approach to enhance ECG image interpretation using the multimodal LLaMA 3.2 model. We used a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), specifically designed to boost the model's ability to understand ECG images and achieve better outcomes across a wide range of cardiac conditions. Our method is tailored for ECG analysis and leverages ECGInstruct, a large-scale instruction dataset with 1 Million samples. This dataset is a rich collection of synthesized ECG images, generated from raw ECG data from trusted open-source repositories like MIMIC-IV ECG and PTB-XL. Each ECG image in ECGInstruct comes with expert-written questions and detailed answers, covering diverse ECG interpretation scenarios, including complex cardiac conditions like Myocardial Infarction and Conduction Disturbances. Our fine-tuning approach efficiently adapts the LLaMA 3.2 model (built upon LLaMA 3) by integrating low-rank adaptation techniques, focusing on efficiency by updating only a small set of parameters, specifically ignoring the `lm_head` and `embed_tokens` layers. This paper details the model setup, our efficient fine-tuning method, and implementation specifics. We provide a thorough evaluation through extensive experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method across various ECG interpretation tasks. The results convincingly show that our parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning achieves excellent performance in ECG image interpretation, significantly outperforming baseline models and reaching accuracy comparable to or exceeding traditional CNN-based methods in identifying a wide range of cardiac abnormalities, including over 70 conditions from the PTB-XL dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling detector response is a key challenge in time projection chambers. We cast this problem as an unpaired point cloud translation task, between data collected from simulations and from experimental runs. Effective translation can assist with both noise rejection and the construction of high-fidelity simulators. Building on recent work in diffusion probabilistic models, we present a novel framework for performing this mapping. We demonstrate the success of our approach in both synthetic domains and in data sourced from the Active-Target Time Projection Chamber.</description>

      <title>Human Re-ID Meets LVLMs: What can we expect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been regarded as a breakthrough advance in an astoundingly variety of tasks, from content generation to virtual assistants and multimodal search or retrieval. However, for many of these applications, the performance of these methods has been widely criticized, particularly when compared with state-of-the-art methods and technologies in each specific domain. In this work, we compare the performance of the leading large vision-language models in the human re-identification task, using as baseline the performance attained by state-of-the-art AI models specifically designed for this problem. We compare the results due to ChatGPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Qwen-VL-Max to a baseline ReID PersonViT model, using the well-known Market1501 dataset. Our evaluation pipeline includes the dataset curation, prompt engineering, and metric selection to assess the models' performance. Results are analyzed from many different perspectives: similarity scores, classification accuracy, and classification metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and area under curve (AUC). Our results confirm the strengths of LVLMs, but also their severe limitations that often lead to catastrophic answers and should be the scope of further research. As a concluding remark, we speculate about some further research that should fuse traditional and LVLMs to combine the strengths from both families of techniques and achieve solid improvements in performance.</description>

      <title>Full-Head Segmentation of MRI with Abnormal Brain Anatomy: Model and Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work was to develop a deep network for whole-head segmentation, including clinical MRIs with abnormal anatomy, and compile the first public benchmark dataset for this purpose. We collected 91 MRIs with volumetric segmentation labels for a diverse set of human subjects (4 normal, 32 traumatic brain injuries, and 57 strokes). These clinical cases are characterized by extended cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in regions normally containing the brain. Training labels were generated by manually correcting initial automated segmentations for skin/scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, white matter, air cavity, and extracephalic air. We developed a MultiAxial network consisting of three 2D U-Net models that operate independently in sagittal, axial, and coronal planes and are then combined to produce a single 3D segmentation. The MultiAxial network achieved test-set Dice scores of 0.88 (median plus-minus 0.04). For brain tissue, it significantly outperforms existing brain segmentation methods (MultiAxial: 0.898 plus-minus 0.041, SynthSeg: 0.758 plus-minus 0.054, BrainChop: 0.757 plus-minus 0.125). The MultiAxial network gains in robustness by avoiding the need for coregistration with an atlas. It performed well in regions with abnormal anatomy and on images that have been de-identified. It enables more robust current flow modeling when incorporated into ROAST, a widely-used modeling toolbox for transcranial electric stimulation. We are releasing a state-of-the-art model for whole-head MRI segmentation, along with a dataset of 61 clinical MRIs and training labels, including non-brain structures. Together, the model and data may serve as a benchmark for future efforts.</description>

      <title>Strong and Controllable 3D Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion generation is a significant pursuit in generative computer vision with widespread applications in film-making, video games, AR/VR, and human-robot interaction. Current methods mainly utilize either diffusion-based generative models or autoregressive models for text-to-motion generation. However, they face two significant challenges: (1) The generation process is time-consuming, posing a major obstacle for real-time applications such as gaming, robot manipulation, and other online settings. (2) These methods typically learn a relative motion representation guided by text, making it difficult to generate motion sequences with precise joint-level control. These challenges significantly hinder progress and limit the real-world application of human motion generation techniques. To address this gap, we propose a simple yet effective architecture consisting of two key components. Firstly, we aim to improve hardware efficiency and computational complexity in transformer-based diffusion models for human motion generation. By customizing flash linear attention, we can optimize these models specifically for generating human motion efficiently. Furthermore, we will customize the consistency model in the motion latent space to further accelerate motion generation. Secondly, we introduce Motion ControlNet, which enables more precise joint-level control of human motion compared to previous text-to-motion generation methods. These contributions represent a significant advancement for text-to-motion generation, bringing it closer to real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Motion Diffusion Autoencoders: Enabling Attribute Manipulation in Human Motion Demonstrated on Karate Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attribute manipulation deals with the problem of changing individual attributes of a data point or a time series, while leaving all other aspects unaffected. This work focuses on the domain of human motion, more precisely karate movement patterns. To the best of our knowledge, it presents the first success at manipulating attributes of human motion data. One of the key requirements for achieving attribute manipulation on human motion is a suitable pose representation. Therefore, we design a novel rotation-based pose representation that enables the disentanglement of the human skeleton and the motion trajectory, while still allowing an accurate reconstruction of the original anatomy. The core idea of the manipulation approach is to use a transformer encoder for discovering high-level semantics, and a diffusion probabilistic model for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. We show that the embedding space obtained from the transformer encoder is semantically meaningful and linear. This enables the manipulation of high-level attributes, by discovering their linear direction of change in the semantic embedding space and moving the embedding along said direction. The code and data are available at https://github.com/anthony-mendil/MoDiffAE.</description>

      <title>INT: Instance-Specific Negative Mining for Task-Generic Promptable Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-generic promptable image segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of diverse samples under a single task description by utilizing only one task-generic prompt. Current methods leverage the generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer instance-specific prompts from these task-generic prompts in order to guide the segmentation process. However, when VLMs struggle to generalise to some image instances, predicting instance-specific prompts becomes poor. To solve this problem, we introduce \textbf{I}nstance-specific \textbf{N}egative Mining for \textbf{T}ask-Generic Promptable Segmentation (\textbf{INT}). The key idea of INT is to adaptively reduce the influence of irrelevant (negative) prior knowledge whilst to increase the use the most plausible prior knowledge, selected by negative mining with higher contrast, in order to optimise instance-specific prompts generation. Specifically, INT consists of two components: (1) instance-specific prompt generation, which progressively fliters out incorrect information in prompt generation; (2) semantic mask generation, which ensures each image instance segmentation matches correctly the semantics of the instance-specific prompts. INT is validated on six datasets, including camouflaged objects and medical images, demonstrating its effectiveness, robustness and scalability.</description>

      <title>A New Statistical Approach to the Performance Analysis of Vision-based Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern wireless devices with accurate positioning needs also have access to vision sensors, such as a camera, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). In scenarios where wireless-based positioning is either inaccurate or unavailable, using information from vision sensors becomes highly desirable for determining the precise location of the wireless device. Specifically, vision data can be used to estimate distances between the target (where the sensors are mounted) and nearby landmarks. However, a significant challenge in positioning using these measurements is the inability to uniquely identify which specific landmark is visible in the data. For instance, when the target is located close to a lamppost, it becomes challenging to precisely identify the specific lamppost (among several in the region) that is near the target. This work proposes a new framework for target localization using range measurements to multiple proximate landmarks. The geometric constraints introduced by these measurements are utilized to narrow down candidate landmark combinations corresponding to the range measurements and, consequently, the target's location on a map. By modeling landmarks as a marked Poisson point process (PPP), we show that three noise-free range measurements are sufficient to uniquely determine the correct combination of landmarks in a two-dimensional plane. For noisy measurements, we provide a mathematical characterization of the probability of correctly identifying the observed landmark combination based on a novel joint distribution of key random variables. Our results demonstrate that the landmark combination can be identified using ranges, even when individual landmarks are visually indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>RUN: Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing concealed object segmentation (COS) methods frequently utilize reversible strategies to address uncertain regions. However, these approaches are typically restricted to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To address this, we propose the Reversible Unfolding Network (RUN), which applies reversible strategies across both mask and RGB domains through a theoretically grounded framework, enabling accurate segmentation. RUN first formulates a novel COS model by incorporating an extra residual sparsity constraint to minimize segmentation uncertainties. The iterative optimization steps of the proposed model are then unfolded into a multistage network, with each step corresponding to a stage. Each stage of RUN consists of two reversible modules: the Segmentation-Oriented Foreground Separation (SOFS) module and the Reconstruction-Oriented Background Extraction (ROBE) module. SOFS applies the reversible strategy at the mask level and introduces Reversible State Space to capture non-local information. ROBE extends this to the RGB domain, employing a reconstruction network to address conflicting foreground and background regions identified as distortion-prone areas, which arise from their separate estimation by independent modules. As the stages progress, RUN gradually facilitates reversible modeling of foreground and background in both the mask and RGB domains, directing the network's attention to uncertain regions and mitigating false-positive and false-negative results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of RUN and highlight the potential of unfolding-based frameworks for COS and other high-level vision tasks. We will release the code and models.</description>

      <title>Multispectral 3D mapping on a Roman sculpture to study ancient polychromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research into the polychromy of Greek and Roman sculptures has surged to explore the hypothesis that ancient sculptures were originally not pristine white but adorned with colors. Multispectral and multimodal imaging techniques have been crucial in studying painted surfaces, revealing polychromies even in traces. In fact, imaging techniques, such as reflectance and fluorescence, can identify different materials and map inhomogeneities, guiding further investigations such as Raman, XRays Fluorescence, and Fourier Transform InfraRed Spectroscopy (FTIR) to investigate residual colors. However, this approach may underestimate the original polychromies' extent over the complex articulation of a sculptured surface. This study proposes a methodology to analyze the original appearance of ancient sculptures using reality-based 3D models with textures not limited to those visible to the naked eye. We employ Visible Reflected Imaging (VIS) and Ultraviolet-induced Fluorescence Imaging (UVF). From the UVF and VIS datasets, the underlying 3D model is built by means of photogrammetry. Through raw data processing, images taken with different illuminating sources are successfully aligned and processed, creating a single 3D model with multiple textures mapped onto the same bi-dimensional space. The pixel-to-pixel correspondence of different textures allows for the implementation of a classification algorithm that can directly map its outcome onto the 3D model surface. This enables conservators to deepen their understanding of artifact preservation, observe mate-rial distribution in detail, and correlate this with 3D geometrical data. In this study, we experiment with this approach on an ancient Roman sculpture of Artemis, conserved at the Archeological and Art Museum of Maremma (MAAM) in Grosseto, Italy.</description>

      <title>Tuning Event Camera Biases Heuristic for Object Detection Applications in Staring Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in unlocking the potential of neuromorphic cameras, also called 'event cameras', is the development of novel methods that solve the multi-parameter problem of adjusting their bias parameters to accommodate a desired task. Actually, it is very difficult to find in the literature a systematic heuristic that solves the problem for any desired application.
  In this paper we present a tuning parametes heuristic for the biases of event cameras, for tasks that require small objects detection in staring scenarios. The main purpose of the heuristic is to squeeze the camera's potential, optimize its performance, and expand its detection capabilities as much as possible.
  In the presentation, we translate the experimental properties of event camera and systemic constrains into mathematical terms, and show, under certain assumptions, how the multi-variable problem collapses into a two-parameter problem that can be solved experimentally.
  A main conclusion that will be demonstrated is that for certain desired signals, such as the one provided by an incandescent lamp powered by the periodic electrical grid, the optimal values of the camera are very far from the default values recommended by the manufacturer.</description>

      <title>Every Image Listens, Every Image Dances: Music-Driven Image Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image animation has become a promising area in multimodal research, with a focus on generating videos from reference images. While prior work has largely emphasized generic video generation guided by text, music-driven dance video generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MuseDance, an innovative end-to-end model that animates reference images using both music and text inputs. This dual input enables MuseDance to generate personalized videos that follow text descriptions and synchronize character movements with the music. Unlike existing approaches, MuseDance eliminates the need for complex motion guidance inputs, such as pose or depth sequences, making flexible and creative video generation accessible to users of all expertise levels. To advance research in this field, we present a new multimodal dataset comprising 2,904 dance videos with corresponding background music and text descriptions. Our approach leverages diffusion-based methods to achieve robust generalization, precise control, and temporal consistency, setting a new baseline for the music-driven image animation task.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Novel View and Depth Synthesis with Multi-View Geometric Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current methods for 3D scene reconstruction from sparse posed images employ intermediate 3D representations such as neural fields, voxel grids, or 3D Gaussians, to achieve multi-view consistent scene appearance and geometry. In this paper we introduce MVGD, a diffusion-based architecture capable of direct pixel-level generation of images and depth maps from novel viewpoints, given an arbitrary number of input views. Our method uses raymap conditioning to both augment visual features with spatial information from different viewpoints, as well as to guide the generation of images and depth maps from novel views. A key aspect of our approach is the multi-task generation of images and depth maps, using learnable task embeddings to guide the diffusion process towards specific modalities. We train this model on a collection of more than 60 million multi-view samples from publicly available datasets, and propose techniques to enable efficient and consistent learning in such diverse conditions. We also propose a novel strategy that enables the efficient training of larger models by incrementally fine-tuning smaller ones, with promising scaling behavior. Through extensive experiments, we report state-of-the-art results in multiple novel view synthesis benchmarks, as well as multi-view stereo and video depth estimation.</description>

      <title>Early Diagnosis and Severity Assessment of Weligama Coconut Leaf Wilt Disease and Coconut Caterpillar Infestation using Deep Learning-based Image Processing Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Coconut (Cocos nucifera (L.)) cultivation faces significant challenges, including yield loss, due to pest and disease outbreaks. In particular, Weligama Coconut Leaf Wilt Disease (WCWLD) and Coconut Caterpillar Infestation (CCI) damage coconut trees, causing severe coconut production loss in Sri Lanka and nearby coconut-producing countries. Currently, both WCWLD and CCI are detected through on-field human observations, a process that is not only time-consuming but also limits the early detection of infections. This paper presents a study conducted in Sri Lanka, demonstrating the effectiveness of employing transfer learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Mask Region-based-CNN (Mask R-CNN) to identify WCWLD and CCI at their early stages and to assess disease progression. Further, this paper presents the use of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection model to count the number of caterpillars distributed on leaves with CCI. The introduced methods were tested and validated using datasets collected from Matara, Puttalam, and Makandura, Sri Lanka. The results show that the proposed methods identify WCWLD and CCI with an accuracy of 90% and 95%, respectively. In addition, the proposed WCWLD disease severity identification method classifies the severity with an accuracy of 97%. Furthermore, the accuracies of the object detection models for calculating the number of caterpillars in the leaflets were: YOLOv5-96.87%, YOLOv8-96.1%, and YOLO11-95.9%.</description>

      <title>Project-and-Fuse: Improving RGB-D Semantic Segmentation via Graph Convolution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing RGB-D semantic segmentation methods focus on the feature level fusion, including complex cross-modality and cross-scale fusion modules. However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.</description>

      <title>FlexiCrackNet: A Flexible Pipeline for Enhanced Crack Segmentation with General Features Transfered from SAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic crack segmentation is a cornerstone technology for intelligent visual perception modules in road safety maintenance and structural integrity systems. Existing deep learning models and ``pre-training + fine-tuning'' paradigms often face challenges of limited adaptability in resource-constrained environments and inadequate scalability across diverse data domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexiCrackNet, a novel pipeline that seamlessly integrates traditional deep learning paradigms with the strengths of large-scale pre-trained models. At its core, FlexiCrackNet employs an encoder-decoder architecture to extract task-specific features. The lightweight EdgeSAM's CNN-based encoder is exclusively used as a generic feature extractor, decoupled from the fixed input size requirements of EdgeSAM. To harmonize general and domain-specific features, we introduce the information-Interaction gated attention mechanism (IGAM), which adaptively fuses multi-level features to enhance segmentation performance while mitigating irrelevant noise. This design enables the efficient transfer of general knowledge to crack segmentation tasks while ensuring adaptability to diverse input resolutions and resource-constrained environments. Experiments show that FlexiCrackNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, excels in zero-shot generalization, computational efficiency, and segmentation robustness under challenging scenarios such as blurry inputs, complex backgrounds, and visually ambiguous artifacts. These advancements underscore the potential of FlexiCrackNet for real-world applications in automated crack detection and comprehensive structural health monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Test-time Loss Landscape Adaptation for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation of pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a technique for tackling distribution shifts during the test time. Although existing methods, especially those based on Test-time Prompt Tuning (TPT), have shown promising results, their high computational cost associated with parameter optimization presents challenges for scalability and practical application. This paper unveils the unnecessary nature of backpropagation in existing methods from a loss landscape perspective. Building on this insight, this paper proposes a simple yet effective framework called Test-time Loss Landscape Adaptation (TLLA). TLLA leverages the relative position between the training minimum and test loss landscapes to guide the adaptation process, avoiding the update of model parameters at test time. Specifically, it mainly consists of two main stages: In the prompt tuning stage, a Sharpness-Aware Prompt Tuning (SAPT) method is introduced to identify the training flat minimum, setting the foundation for the subsequent test-time adaptation; In the test stage, a Sharpness-based Test Sample Selection (STSS) approach is utilized to ensure the alignment of flat minima within the training loss landscape and each augmented test sample's loss landscape. Extensive experiments on both domain generalization and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that TLLA achieves state-of-the-art performances while significantly reducing computational overhead. Notably, TLLA surpasses TPT by an average of 5.32\% and 6.98\% on four ImageNet variant datasets when employing ResNet50 and ViT-B/16 image encoders, respectively. The code will be available soon.</description>

      <title>REG: Rectified Gradient Guidance for Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guidance techniques are simple yet effective for improving conditional generation in diffusion models. Albeit their empirical success, the practical implementation of guidance diverges significantly from its theoretical motivation. In this paper, we reconcile this discrepancy by replacing the scaled marginal distribution target, which we prove theoretically invalid, with a valid scaled joint distribution objective. Additionally, we show that the established guidance implementations are approximations to the intractable optimal solution under no future foresight constraint. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose rectified gradient guidance (REG), a versatile enhancement designed to boost the performance of existing guidance methods. Experiments on 1D and 2D demonstrate that REG provides a better approximation to the optimal solution than prior guidance techniques, validating the proposed theoretical framework. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation tasks show that incorporating REG consistently improves FID and Inception/CLIP scores across various settings compared to its absence.</description>

      <title>UP-VLA: A Unified Understanding and Prediction Model for Embodied Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.</description>

      <title>Distorting Embedding Space for Safety: A Defense Mechanism for Adversarially Robust Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models show remarkable generation performance following text prompts, but risk generating Not Safe For Work (NSFW) contents from unsafe prompts. Existing approaches, such as prompt filtering or concept unlearning, fail to defend against adversarial attacks while maintaining benign image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Distorting Embedding Space (DES), a text encoder-based defense mechanism that effectively tackles these issues through innovative embedding space control. DES transforms unsafe embeddings, extracted from a text encoder using unsafe prompts, toward carefully calculated safe embedding regions to prevent unsafe contents generation, while reproducing the original safe embeddings. DES also neutralizes the nudity embedding, extracted using prompt ``nudity", by aligning it with neutral embedding to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. These methods ensure both robust defense and high-quality image generation. Additionally, DES can be adopted in a plug-and-play manner and requires zero inference overhead, facilitating its deployment. Extensive experiments on diverse attack types, including black-box and white-box scenarios, demonstrate DES's state-of-the-art performance in both defense capability and benign image generation quality. Our model is available at https://github.com/aei13/DES.</description>

      <title>RLS3: RL-Based Synthetic Sample Selection to Enhance Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Indoor Autonomous Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) fine-tuning for application-specific visual grounding based on natural language instructions has become one of the most popular approaches for learning-enabled autonomous systems. However, such fine-tuning relies heavily on high-quality datasets to achieve successful performance in various downstream tasks. Additionally, VLMs often encounter limitations due to insufficient and imbalanced fine-tuning data. To address these issues, we propose a new generalizable framework to improve VLM fine-tuning by integrating it with a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. Our method utilizes the RL agent to manipulate objects within an indoor setting to create synthetic data for fine-tuning to address certain vulnerabilities of the VLM. Specifically, we use the performance of the VLM to provide feedback to the RL agent to generate informative data that efficiently fine-tune the VLM over the targeted task (e.g. spatial reasoning). The key contribution of this work is developing a framework where the RL agent serves as an informative data sampling tool and assists the VLM in order to enhance performance and address task-specific vulnerabilities. By targeting the data sampling process to address the weaknesses of the VLM, we can effectively train a more context-aware model. In addition, generating synthetic data allows us to have precise control over each scene and generate granular ground truth captions. Our results show that the proposed data generation approach improves the spatial reasoning performance of VLMs, which demonstrates the benefits of using RL-guided data generation in vision-language tasks.</description>

      <title>GestureLSM: Latent Shortcut based Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Spatial-Temporal Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling human gestures based on speech signals presents a significant challenge in computer vision. While existing works did preliminary studies of generating holistic co-speech gesture from speech, the spatial interaction of each body region during the speech remains barely explored. This leads to wield body part interactions given the speech signal. Furthermore, the slow generation speed limits the construction of real-world digital avatars. To resolve these problems, we propose \textbf{GestureLSM}, a Latent Shortcut based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. We tokenize various body regions and explicitly model their interactions with spatial and temporal attention. To achieve real-time gesture generations, we exam the denoising patterns and design an effective time distribution to speed up sampling while improve the generation quality for shortcut model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GestureLSM, showcasing its potential for various applications in the development of digital humans and embodied agents.

      <title>Rethinking Diffusion Posterior Sampling: From Conditional Score Estimator to Maximizing a Posterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have been leveraged to address inverse problems without additional training, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) (Chung et al., 2022a) is among the most popular approaches. Previous analyses suggest that DPS accomplishes posterior sampling by approximating the conditional score. While in this paper, we demonstrate that the conditional score approximation employed by DPS is not as effective as previously assumed, but rather aligns more closely with the principle of maximizing a posterior (MAP). This assertion is substantiated through an examination of DPS on 512x512 ImageNet images, revealing that: 1) DPS's conditional score estimation significantly diverges from the score of a well-trained conditional diffusion model and is even inferior to the unconditional score; 2) The mean of DPS's conditional score estimation deviates significantly from zero, rendering it an invalid score estimation; 3) DPS generates high-quality samples with significantly lower diversity. In light of the above findings, we posit that DPS more closely resembles MAP than a conditional score estimator, and accordingly propose the following enhancements to DPS: 1) we explicitly maximize the posterior through multi-step gradient ascent and projection; 2) we utilize a light-weighted conditional score estimator trained with only 100 images and 8 GPU hours. Extensive experimental results indicate that these proposed improvements significantly enhance DPS's performance. The source code for these improvements is provided in https://github.com/tongdaxu/Rethinking-Diffusion-Posterior-Sampling-From-Conditional-Score-Estimator-to-Maximizing-a-Posterior.</description>

      <title>Training-free Quantum-Inspired Image Edge Extraction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge detection is a cornerstone of image processing, yet existing methods often face critical limitations. Traditional deep learning edge detection methods require extensive training datasets and fine-tuning, while classical techniques often fail in complex or noisy scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, quantum-inspired edge detection model. Our approach integrates classical Sobel edge detection, the Schr\"odinger wave equation refinement, and a hybrid framework combining Canny and Laplacian operators. By eliminating the need for training, the model is lightweight and adaptable to diverse applications. The Schr\"odinger wave equation refines gradient-based edge maps through iterative diffusion, significantly enhancing edge precision. The hybrid framework further strengthens the model by synergistically combining local and global features, ensuring robustness even under challenging conditions. Extensive evaluations on datasets like BIPED, Multicue, and NYUD demonstrate superior performance of the proposed model, achieving state-of-the-art metrics, including ODS, OIS, AP, and F-measure. Noise robustness experiments highlight its reliability, showcasing its practicality for real-world scenarios. Due to its versatile and adaptable nature, our model is well-suited for applications such as medical imaging, autonomous systems, and environmental monitoring, setting a new benchmark for edge detection.</description>

      <title>TV-Dialogue: Crafting Theme-Aware Video Dialogues with Immersive Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs have accelerated the development of dialogue generation across text and images, yet video-based dialogue generation remains underexplored and presents unique challenges. In this paper, we introduce Theme-aware Video Dialogue Crafting (TVDC), a novel task aimed at generating new dialogues that align with video content and adhere to user-specified themes. We propose TV-Dialogue, a novel multi-modal agent framework that ensures both theme alignment (i.e., the dialogue revolves around the theme) and visual consistency (i.e., the dialogue matches the emotions and behaviors of characters in the video) by enabling real-time immersive interactions among video characters, thereby accurately understanding the video content and generating new dialogue that aligns with the given themes. To assess the generated dialogues, we present a multi-granularity evaluation benchmark with high accuracy, interpretability and reliability, demonstrating the effectiveness of TV-Dialogue on self-collected dataset over directly using existing LLMs. Extensive experiments reveal that TV-Dialogue can generate dialogues for videos of any length and any theme in a zero-shot manner without training. Our findings underscore the potential of TV-Dialogue for various applications, such as video re-creation, film dubbing and its use in downstream multimodal tasks.</description>

      <title>LLMDet: Learning Strong Open-Vocabulary Object Detectors under the Supervision of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary detectors achieve promising performance with abundant region-level annotated data. In this work, we show that an open-vocabulary detector co-training with a large language model by generating image-level detailed captions for each image can further improve performance. To achieve the goal, we first collect a dataset, GroundingCap-1M, wherein each image is accompanied by associated grounding labels and an image-level detailed caption. With this dataset, we finetune an open-vocabulary detector with training objectives including a standard grounding loss and a caption generation loss. We take advantage of a large language model to generate both region-level short captions for each region of interest and image-level long captions for the whole image. Under the supervision of the large language model, the resulting detector, LLMDet, outperforms the baseline by a clear margin, enjoying superior open-vocabulary ability. Further, we show that the improved LLMDet can in turn build a stronger large multi-modal model, achieving mutual benefits. The code, model, and dataset is available at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/LLMDet.</description>

      <title>OmniPhysGS: 3D Constitutive Gaussians for General Physics-Based Dynamics Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, significant advancements have been made in the reconstruction and generation of 3D assets, including static cases and those with physical interactions. To recover the physical properties of 3D assets, existing methods typically assume that all materials belong to a specific predefined category (e.g., elasticity). However, such assumptions ignore the complex composition of multiple heterogeneous objects in real scenarios and tend to render less physically plausible animation given a wider range of objects. We propose OmniPhysGS for synthesizing a physics-based 3D dynamic scene composed of more general objects. A key design of OmniPhysGS is treating each 3D asset as a collection of constitutive 3D Gaussians. For each Gaussian, its physical material is represented by an ensemble of 12 physical domain-expert sub-models (rubber, metal, honey, water, etc.), which greatly enhances the flexibility of the proposed model. In the implementation, we define a scene by user-specified prompts and supervise the estimation of material weighting factors via a pretrained video diffusion model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPhysGS achieves more general and realistic physical dynamics across a broader spectrum of materials, including elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, and fluid substances, as well as interactions between different materials. Our method surpasses existing methods by approximately 3% to 16% in metrics of visual quality and text alignment.</description>

      <title>Context Matters: Query-aware Dynamic Long Sequence Modeling of Gigapixel Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive number of patches in gigapixel images. While transformer architectures excel at modeling long-range correlations through self-attention, their quadratic computational complexity makes them impractical for computational pathology applications. Existing solutions like local-global or linear self-attention reduce computational costs but compromise the strong modeling capabilities of full self-attention. In this work, we propose Querent, i.e., the query-aware long contextual dynamic modeling framework, which maintains the expressive power of full self-attention while achieving practical efficiency. Our method adaptively predicts which surrounding regions are most relevant for each patch, enabling focused yet unrestricted attention computation only with potentially important contexts. By using efficient region-wise metadata computation and importance estimation, our approach dramatically reduces computational overhead while preserving global perception to model fine-grained patch correlations. Through comprehensive experiments on biomarker prediction, gene mutation prediction, cancer subtyping, and survival analysis across over 10 WSI datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Code will be made available at https://github.com/dddavid4real/Querent.</description>

      <title>Visual Autoregressive Modeling for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (ISR) has seen significant progress with the introduction of remarkable generative models. However, challenges such as the trade-off issues between fidelity and realism, as well as computational complexity, have also posed limitations on their application. Building upon the tremendous success of autoregressive models in the language domain, we propose \textbf{VARSR}, a novel visual autoregressive modeling for ISR framework with the form of next-scale prediction. To effectively integrate and preserve semantic information in low-resolution images, we propose using prefix tokens to incorporate the condition. Scale-aligned Rotary Positional Encodings are introduced to capture spatial structures and the diffusion refiner is utilized for modeling quantization residual loss to achieve pixel-level fidelity. Image-based Classifier-free Guidance is proposed to guide the generation of more realistic images. Furthermore, we collect large-scale data and design a training process to obtain robust generative priors. Quantitative and qualitative results show that VARSR is capable of generating high-fidelity and high-realism images with more efficiency than diffusion-based methods. Our codes will be released at https://github.com/qyp2000/VARSR.</description>

      <title>VKFPos: A Learning-Based Monocular Positioning with Variational Bayesian Extended Kalman Filter Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in learning-based monocular positioning by proposing VKFPos, a novel approach that integrates Absolute Pose Regression (APR) and Relative Pose Regression (RPR) via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) within a variational Bayesian inference framework. Our method shows that the essential posterior probability of the monocular positioning problem can be decomposed into APR and RPR components. This decomposition is embedded in the deep learning model by predicting covariances in both APR and RPR branches, allowing them to account for associated uncertainties. These covariances enhance the loss functions and facilitate EKF integration. Experimental evaluations on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that the single-shot APR branch achieves accuracy on par with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, for temporal positioning, where consecutive images allow for RPR and EKF integration, VKFPos outperforms temporal APR and model-based integration methods, achieving superior accuracy.</description>

      <title>Virtual airways heatmaps to optimize point of entry location in lung biopsy planning systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: We present a virtual model to optimize point of entry (POE) in lung biopsy planning systems. Our model allows to compute the quality of a biopsy sample taken from potential POE, taking into account the margin of error that arises from discrepancies between the orientation in the planning simulation and the actual orientation during the operation. Additionally, the study examines the impact of the characteristics of the lesion. Methods: The quality of the biopsy is given by a heatmap projected onto the skeleton of a patient-specific model of airways. The skeleton provides a 3D representation of airways structure, while the heatmap intensity represents the potential amount of tissue that it could be extracted from each POE. This amount of tissue is determined by the intersection of the lesion with a cone that represents the uncertainty area in the introduction of biopsy instruments. The cone, lesion, and skeleton are modelled as graphical objects that define a 3D scene of the intervention. Results: We have simulated different settings of the intervention scene from a single anatomy extracted from a CT scan and two lesions with regular and irregular shapes. The different scenarios are simulated by systematic rotation of each lesion placed at different distances from airways. Analysis of the heatmaps for the different settings show a strong impact of lesion orientation for irregular shape and the distance for both shapes. Conclusion: The proposed heatmaps help to visually assess the optimal POE and identify whether multiple optimal POEs exist in different zones of the bronchi. They also allow us to model the maximum allowable error in navigation systems and study which variables have the greatest influence on the success of the operation. Additionally, they help determine at what point this influence could potentially jeopardize the operation.</description>

      <title>XRF V2: A Dataset for Action Summarization with Wi-Fi Signals, and IMUs in Phones, Watches, Earbuds, and Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in applications such as health monitoring, smart home automation, and human-computer interaction. While HAR has been extensively studied, action summarization, which involves identifying and summarizing continuous actions, remains an emerging task. This paper introduces the novel XRF V2 dataset, designed for indoor daily activity Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and action summarization. XRF V2 integrates multimodal data from Wi-Fi signals, IMU sensors (smartphones, smartwatches, headphones, and smart glasses), and synchronized video recordings, offering a diverse collection of indoor activities from 16 volunteers across three distinct environments. To tackle TAL and action summarization, we propose the XRFMamba neural network, which excels at capturing long-term dependencies in untrimmed sensory sequences and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as ActionFormer and WiFiTAD. We envision XRF V2 as a valuable resource for advancing research in human action localization, action forecasting, pose estimation, multimodal foundation models pre-training, synthetic data generation, and more.</description>

      <title>SynthmanticLiDAR: A Synthetic Dataset for Semantic Segmentation on LiDAR Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation on LiDAR imaging is increasingly gaining attention, as it can provide useful knowledge for perception systems and potential for autonomous driving. However, collecting and labeling real LiDAR data is an expensive and time-consuming task. While datasets such as SemanticKITTI have been manually collected and labeled, the introduction of simulation tools such as CARLA, has enabled the creation of synthetic datasets on demand.
  In this work, we present a modified CARLA simulator designed with LiDAR semantic segmentation in mind, with new classes, more consistent object labeling with their counterparts from real datasets such as SemanticKITTI, and the possibility to adjust the object class distribution. Using this tool, we have generated SynthmanticLiDAR, a synthetic dataset for semantic segmentation on LiDAR imaging, designed to be similar to SemanticKITTI, and we evaluate its contribution to the training process of different semantic segmentation algorithms by using a naive transfer learning approach. Our results show that incorporating SynthmanticLiDAR into the training process improves the overall performance of tested algorithms, proving the usefulness of our dataset, and therefore, our adapted CARLA simulator.
  The dataset and simulator are available in https://github.com/vpulab/SynthmanticLiDAR.</description>

      <title>Beyond Token Compression: A Training-Free Reduction Framework for Efficient Visual Processing in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are typically based on decoder-only or cross-attention architectures. While decoder-only MLLMs outperform their cross-attention counterparts, they require significantly higher computational resources due to extensive self-attention and FFN operations on visual tokens. This raises the question: can we eliminate these expensive operations while maintaining the performance? To this end, we present a novel analysis framework to investigate the necessity of these costly operations in decoder-only MLLMs. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Hollow Attention, which limits visual token interactions to local attention while maintaining visual-text associations, and (2) Probe-Activated Dynamic FFN, which selectively activates FFN parameters for visual tokens. Both methods do not require fine-tuning, which significantly enhances analysis efficiency. To assess the impact of applying these reductions across different proportions of layers, we developed a greedy search method that significantly narrows the search space. Experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that applying our reductions to approximately half of the layers not only maintains but sometimes improves model performance, indicating significant computational redundancy in current architectures. Additionally, our method is orthogonal to existing token compression techniques, allowing for further combination to achieve greater computational reduction. Our findings may provide valuable insights for the design of more efficient future MLLMs. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/L-Hugh/Beyond-Token-Compression.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Cross-Modal Text-Image Time Series Retrieval in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of image time series retrieval (ITSR) methods is a growing research interest in remote sensing (RS). Given a user-defined image time series (i.e., the query time series), the ITSR methods search and retrieve from large archives the image time series that have similar content to the query time series. The existing ITSR methods in RS are designed for unimodal retrieval problems, limiting their usability and versatility. To overcome this issue, as a first time in RS we introduce the task of cross-modal text-ITSR. In particular, we present a self-supervised cross-modal text-image time series retrieval (text-ITSR) method that enables the retrieval of image time series using text sentences as queries, and vice versa. In detail, we focus our attention on text-ITSR in pairs of images (i.e., bitemporal images). The proposed text-ITSR method consists of two key components: 1) modality-specific encoders to model the semantic content of bitemporal images and text sentences with discriminative features; and 2) modality-specific projection heads to align textual and image representations in a shared embedding space. To effectively model the temporal information within the bitemporal images, we introduce two fusion strategies: i) global feature fusion (GFF) strategy that combines global image features through simple yet effective operators; and ii) transformer-based feature fusion (TFF) strategy that leverages transformers for fine-grained temporal integration. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark RS archives demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately retrieving semantically relevant bitemporal images (or text sentences) to a query text sentence (or bitemporal image). The code of this work is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/cross-modal-text-tsir.</description>

      <title>Text-to-CAD Generation Through Infusing Visual Feedback in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models requires significant expertise and effort. Text-to-CAD, which converts textual descriptions into CAD parametric sequences, is crucial in streamlining this process. Recent studies have utilized ground-truth parametric sequences, known as sequential signals, as supervision to achieve this goal. However, CAD models are inherently multimodal, comprising parametric sequences and corresponding rendered visual objects. Besides,the rendering process from parametric sequences to visual objects is many-to-one. Therefore, both sequential and visual signals are critical for effective training. In this work, we introduce CADFusion, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone and alternates between two training stages: the sequential learning (SL) stage and the visual feedback (VF) stage. In the SL stage, we train LLMs using ground-truth parametric sequences, enabling the generation of logically coherent parametric sequences. In the VF stage, we reward parametric sequences that render into visually preferred objects and penalize those that do not, allowing LLMs to learn how rendered visual objects are perceived and evaluated. These two stages alternate throughout the training, ensuring balanced learning and preserving benefits of both signals. Experiments demonstrate that CADFusion significantly improves performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Contrast-Aware Calibration for Fine-Tuned CLIP: Leveraging Image-Text Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities and can quickly adapt to downstream tasks through prompt fine-tuning. Unfortunately, in classification tasks involving non-training classes, known as open-vocabulary setting, fine-tuned VLMs often overfit to train classes, resulting in a misalignment between confidence scores and actual accuracy on unseen classes, which significantly undermines their reliability in real-world deployments. Existing confidence calibration methods typically require training parameters or analyzing features from the training dataset, restricting their ability to generalize unseen classes without corresponding train data. Moreover, VLM-specific calibration methods rely solely on text features from train classes as calibration indicators, which inherently limits their ability to calibrate train classes. To address these challenges, we propose an effective multimodal calibration method Contrast-Aware Calibration (CAC). Building on the original CLIP's zero-shot adaptability and the conclusion from empirical analysis that poor intra-class and inter-class discriminative ability on unseen classes is the root cause, we calculate calibration weights based on the contrastive difference between the original and fine-tuned CLIP. This method not only adapts to calibrating unseen classes but also overcomes the limitations of previous VLM calibration methods that could not calibrate train classes. In experiments involving 11 datasets with 5 fine-tuning methods, CAC consistently achieved the best calibration effect on both train and unseen classes without sacrificing accuracy and inference speed.</description>

      <title>EgoMe: Follow Me via Egocentric View in Real World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When interacting with the real world, human often take the egocentric (first-person) view as a benchmark, naturally transferring behaviors observed from a exocentric (third-person) view to their own. This cognitive theory provides a foundation for researching how robots can more effectively imitate human behavior. However, current research either employs multiple cameras with different views focusing on the same individual's behavior simultaneously or encounters unpair ego-exo view scenarios, there is no effort to fully exploit human cognitive behavior in the real world. To fill this gap, in this paper, we introduce a novel large-scale egocentric dataset, called EgoMe, which towards following the process of human imitation learning via egocentric view in the real world. Our dataset includes 7902 pairs of videos (15804 videos) for diverse daily behaviors in real-world scenarios. For a pair of videos, one video captures a exocentric view of the imitator observing the demonstrator's actions, while the other captures a egocentric view of the imitator subsequently following those actions. Notably, our dataset also contain exo-ego eye gaze, angular velocity, acceleration, magnetic strength and other sensor multi-modal data for assisting in establishing correlations between observing and following process. In addition, we also propose eight challenging benchmark tasks for fully leveraging this data resource and promoting the research of robot imitation learning ability. Extensive statistical analysis demonstrates significant advantages compared to existing datasets. The proposed EgoMe dataset and benchmark will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Concept Steerers: Leveraging K-Sparse Autoencoders for Controllable Generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-image generative models, they are prone to adversarial attacks and inadvertently generate unsafe, unethical content. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning models to remove specific concepts, which is computationally expensive, lack scalability, and/or compromise generation quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) to enable efficient and interpretable concept manipulation in diffusion models. Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards a given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce a new concept (e.g., photographic style). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations. Our method yields an improvement of $\mathbf{20.01\%}$ in unsafe concept removal, is effective in style manipulation, and is $\mathbf{\sim5}$x faster than current state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Improving vision-language alignment with graph spiking hybrid Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To bridge the semantic gap between vision and language (VL), it is necessary to develop a good alignment strategy, which includes handling semantic diversity, abstract representation of visual information, and generalization ability of models. Recent works use detector-based bounding boxes or patches with regular partitions to represent visual semantics. While current paradigms have made strides, they are still insufficient for fully capturing the nuanced contextual relations among various objects. This paper proposes a comprehensive visual semantic representation module, necessitating the utilization of panoptic segmentation to generate coherent fine-grained semantic features. Furthermore, we propose a novel Graph Spiking Hybrid Network (GSHN) that integrates the complementary advantages of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to encode visual semantic information. Intriguingly, the model not only encodes the discrete and continuous latent variables of instances but also adeptly captures both local and global contextual features, thereby significantly enhancing the richness and diversity of semantic representations. Leveraging the spatiotemporal properties inherent in SNNs, we employ contrastive learning (CL) to enhance the similarity-based representation of embeddings. This strategy alleviates the computational overhead of the model and enriches meaningful visual representations by constructing positive and negative sample pairs. We design an innovative pre-training method, Spiked Text Learning (STL), which uses text features to improve the encoding ability of discrete semantics. Experiments show that the proposed GSHN exhibits promising results on multiple VL downstream tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become a popular choice for human motion synthesis due to their powerful generative capabilities. However, their high computational complexity and large sampling steps pose challenges for real-time applications. Fortunately, the Consistency Model (CM) provides a solution to greatly reduce the number of sampling steps from hundreds to a few, typically fewer than four, significantly accelerating the synthesis of diffusion models. However, its application to text-conditioned human motion synthesis in latent space remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{MotionPCM}, a phased consistency model-based approach designed to improve the quality and efficiency of real-time motion synthesis in latent space.</description>

      <title>Laser: Efficient Language-Guided Segmentation in Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method that leverages CLIP feature distillation, achieving efficient 3D segmentation through language guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on multi-scale CLIP features and are limited by processing speed and storage requirements, our approach aims to streamline the workflow by directly and effectively distilling dense CLIP features, thereby achieving precise segmentation of 3D scenes using text. To achieve this, we introduce an adapter module and mitigate the noise issue in the dense CLIP feature distillation process through a self-cross-training strategy. Moreover, to enhance the accuracy of segmentation edges, this work presents a low-rank transient query attention mechanism. To ensure the consistency of segmentation for similar colors under different viewpoints, we convert the segmentation task into a classification task through label volume, which significantly improves the consistency of segmentation in color-similar areas. We also propose a simplified text augmentation strategy to alleviate the issue of ambiguity in the correspondence between CLIP features and text. Extensive experimental results show that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art technologies in both training speed and performance. Our code is available on: https://github.com/xingy038/Laser.git.</description>

      <title>Fairness Analysis of CLIP-Based Foundation Models for X-Ray Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray imaging is pivotal in medical diagnostics, offering non-invasive insights into a range of health conditions. Recently, vision-language models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, have demonstrated potential in improving diagnostic accuracy by leveraging large-scale image-text datasets. However, since CLIP was not initially designed for medical images, several CLIP-like models trained specifically on medical images have been developed. Despite their enhanced performance, issues of fairness - particularly regarding demographic attributes - remain largely unaddressed. In this study, we perform a comprehensive fairness analysis of CLIP-like models applied to X-ray image classification. We assess their performance and fairness across diverse patient demographics and disease categories using zero-shot inference and various fine-tuning techniques, including Linear Probing, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and full fine-tuning. Our results indicate that while fine-tuning improves model accuracy, fairness concerns persist, highlighting the need for further fairness interventions in these foundational models.</description>

      <title>JGHand: Joint-Driven Animatable Hand Avater via 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since hands are the primary interface in daily interactions, modeling high-quality digital human hands and rendering realistic images is a critical research problem. Furthermore, considering the requirements of interactive and rendering applications, it is essential to achieve real-time rendering and driveability of the digital model without compromising rendering quality. Thus, we propose Jointly 3D Gaussian Hand (JGHand), a novel joint-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based hand representation that renders high-fidelity hand images in real-time for various poses and characters. Distinct from existing articulated neural rendering techniques, we introduce a differentiable process for spatial transformations based on 3D key points. This process supports deformations from the canonical template to a mesh with arbitrary bone lengths and poses. Additionally, we propose a real-time shadow simulation method based on per-pixel depth to simulate self-occlusion shadows caused by finger movements. Finally, we embed the hand prior and propose an animatable 3DGS representation of the hand driven solely by 3D key points. We validate the effectiveness of each component of our approach through comprehensive ablation studies. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that JGHand achieves real-time rendering speeds with enhanced quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Ambient Denoising Diffusion Generative Adversarial Networks for Establishing Stochastic Object Models from Noisy Image Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that medical imaging systems should be objectively assessed via task-based image quality (IQ) measures that ideally account for all sources of randomness in the measured image data, including the variation in the ensemble of objects to be imaged. Stochastic object models (SOMs) that can randomly draw samples from the object distribution can be employed to characterize object variability. To establish realistic SOMs for task-based IQ analysis, it is desirable to employ experimental image data. However, experimental image data acquired from medical imaging systems are subject to measurement noise. Previous work investigated the ability of deep generative models (DGMs) that employ an augmented generative adversarial network (GAN), AmbientGAN, for establishing SOMs from noisy measured image data. Recently, denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have emerged as a leading DGM for image synthesis and can produce superior image quality than GANs. However, original DDMs possess a slow image-generation process because of the Gaussian assumption in the denoising steps. More recently, denoising diffusion GAN (DDGAN) was proposed to permit fast image generation while maintain high generated image quality that is comparable to the original DDMs. In this work, we propose an augmented DDGAN architecture, Ambient DDGAN (ADDGAN), for learning SOMs from noisy image data. Numerical studies that consider clinical computed tomography (CT) images and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images are conducted. The ability of the proposed ADDGAN to learn realistic SOMs from noisy image data is demonstrated. It has been shown that the ADDGAN significantly outperforms the advanced AmbientGAN models for synthesizing high resolution medical images with complex textures.</description>

      <title>$\infty$-Video: A Training-Free Approach to Long Video Understanding via Continuous-Time Memory Consolidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video-language models struggle with long-video understanding due to limited context lengths and reliance on sparse frame subsampling, often leading to information loss. This paper introduces $\infty$-Video, which can process arbitrarily long videos through a continuous-time long-term memory (LTM) consolidation mechanism. Our framework augments video Q-formers by allowing them to process unbounded video contexts efficiently and without requiring additional training. Through continuous attention, our approach dynamically allocates higher granularity to the most relevant video segments, forming "sticky" memories that evolve over time. Experiments with Video-LLaMA and VideoChat2 demonstrate improved performance in video question-answering tasks, showcasing the potential of continuous-time LTM mechanisms to enable scalable and training-free comprehension of long videos.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark for Incremental Micro-expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expression recognition plays a pivotal role in understanding hidden emotions and has applications across various fields. Traditional recognition methods assume access to all training data at once, but real-world scenarios involve continuously evolving data streams. To respond to the requirement of adapting to new data while retaining previously learned knowledge, we introduce the first benchmark specifically designed for incremental micro-expression recognition. Our contributions include: Firstly, we formulate the incremental learning setting tailored for micro-expression recognition. Secondly, we organize sequential datasets with carefully curated learning orders to reflect real-world scenarios. Thirdly, we define two cross-evaluation-based testing protocols, each targeting distinct evaluation objectives. Finally, we provide six baseline methods and their corresponding evaluation results. This benchmark lays the groundwork for advancing incremental micro-expression recognition research. All code used in this study will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>RGB-Event ISP: The Dataset and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-guided imaging has received significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize instant imaging systems. However, the prior methods primarily focus on enhancing RGB images in a post-processing manner, neglecting the challenges of image signal processor (ISP) dealing with event sensor and the benefits events provide for reforming the ISP process. To achieve this, we conduct the first research on event-guided ISP. First, we present a new event-RAW paired dataset, collected with a novel but still confidential sensor that records pixel-level aligned events and RAW images. This dataset includes 3373 RAW images with 2248 x 3264 resolution and their corresponding events, spanning 24 scenes with 3 exposure modes and 3 lenses. Second, we propose a conventional ISP pipeline to generate good RGB frames as reference. This conventional ISP pipleline performs basic ISP operations, e.g.demosaicing, white balancing, denoising and color space transforming, with a ColorChecker as reference. Third, we classify the existing learnable ISP methods into 3 classes, and select multiple methods to train and evaluate on our new dataset. Lastly, since there is no prior work for reference, we propose a simple event-guided ISP method and test it on our dataset. We further put forward key technical challenges and future directions in RGB-Event ISP. In summary, to the best of our knowledge, this is the very first research focusing on event-guided ISP, and we hope it will inspire the community. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/yunfanLu/RGB-Event-ISP.</description>

      <title>SWAT: Sliding Window Adversarial Training for Gradual Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain shifts are critical issues that harm the performance of machine learning. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) mitigates this issue but suffers when the domain shifts are steep and drastic. Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) alleviates this problem in a mild way by gradually adapting from the source to the target domain using multiple intermediate domains. In this paper, we propose Sliding Window Adversarial Training (SWAT) for Gradual Domain Adaptation. SWAT uses the construction of adversarial streams to connect the feature spaces of the source and target domains. In order to gradually narrow the small gap between adjacent intermediate domains, a sliding window paradigm is designed that moves along the adversarial stream. When the window moves to the end of the stream, i.e., the target domain, the domain shift is drastically reduced. Extensive experiments are conducted on public GDA benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that the proposed SWAT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SWAT-8677.</description>

      <title>GDO: Gradual Domain Osmosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Gradual Domain Osmosis, which aims to solve the problem of smooth knowledge migration from source domain to target domain in Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA). Traditional Gradual Domain Adaptation methods mitigate domain bias by introducing intermediate domains and self-training strategies, but often face the challenges of inefficient knowledge migration or missing data in intermediate domains. In this paper, we design an optimisation framework based on the hyperparameter $\lambda$ by dynamically balancing the loss weights of the source and target domains, which enables the model to progressively adjust the strength of knowledge migration ($\lambda$ incrementing from 0 to 1) during the training process, thus achieving cross-domain generalisation more efficiently. Specifically, the method incorporates self-training to generate pseudo-labels and iteratively updates the model by minimising a weighted loss function to ensure stability and robustness during progressive adaptation in the intermediate domain. The experimental part validates the effectiveness of the method on rotated MNIST, colour-shifted MNIST, portrait dataset and forest cover type dataset, and the results show that it outperforms existing baseline methods. The paper further analyses the impact of the dynamic tuning strategy of the hyperparameter $\lambda$ on the performance through ablation experiments, confirming the advantages of progressive domain penetration in mitigating the domain bias and enhancing the model generalisation capability. The study provides a theoretical support and practical framework for asymptotic domain adaptation and expands its application potential in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>RMDM: Radio Map Diffusion Model with Physics Informed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, the efficient utilization of spectrum resources, optimization of communication quality, and intelligent communication have become critical. Radio map reconstruction is essential for enabling advanced applications, yet challenges such as complex signal propagation and sparse data hinder accurate reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose the **Radio Map Diffusion Model (RMDM)**, a physics-informed framework that integrates **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to incorporate constraints like the **Helmholtz equation**. RMDM employs a dual U-Net architecture: the first ensures physical consistency by minimizing PDE residuals, boundary conditions, and source constraints, while the second refines predictions via diffusion-based denoising. By leveraging physical laws, RMDM significantly enhances accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that RMDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving **NMSE of 0.0031** and **RMSE of 0.0125** under the Static RM (SRM) setting, and **NMSE of 0.0047** and **RMSE of 0.0146** under the Dynamic RM (DRM) setting. These results establish a novel paradigm for integrating physics-informed and data-driven approaches in radio map reconstruction, particularly under sparse data conditions.</description>

      <title>Poison as Cure: Visual Noise for Mitigating Object Hallucinations in LVMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with visual perception capabilities, enabling them to process and interpret visual information. A major challenge compromising their reliability is object hallucination that LVMs may generate plausible but factually inaccurate information. We propose a novel visual adversarial perturbation (VAP) method to mitigate this hallucination issue. VAP alleviates LVM hallucination by applying strategically optimized visual noise without altering the base model. Our approach formulates hallucination suppression as an optimization problem, leveraging adversarial strategies to generate beneficial visual perturbations that enhance the model's factual grounding and reduce parametric knowledge bias. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently reduces object hallucinations across 8 state-of-the-art LVMs, validating its efficacy across diverse evaluations.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Class-Agnostic Counting: Advancements from Reference-Based to Open-World Text-Guided Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object counting has recently shifted towards class-agnostic counting (CAC), which addresses the challenge of counting objects across arbitrary categories, tackling a critical need in versatile counting systems. While humans effortlessly identify and count objects from diverse categories without prior knowledge, most counting methods remain restricted to enumerating instances of known classes, requiring extensive labeled datasets for training, and struggling under open-vocabulary settings. Conversely, CAC aims to count objects belonging to classes never seen during training, typically operating in a few-shot setting. In this paper, for the first time, we review advancements in CAC methodologies, categorizing them into three paradigms based on how target object classes can be specified: reference-based, reference-less, and open-world text-guided. Reference-based approaches have set performance benchmarks using exemplar-guided mechanisms. Reference-less methods eliminate exemplar dependency by leveraging inherent image patterns. Finally, open-world text-guided methods utilize vision-language models, enabling object class descriptions through textual prompts, representing a flexible and appealing solution. We analyze state-of-the-art techniques and we report their results on existing gold standard benchmarks, comparing their performance and identifying and discussing their strengths and limitations. Persistent challenges -- such as annotation dependency, scalability, and generalization -- are discussed, alongside future directions. We believe this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers to understand the progressive developments and contributions over time and the current state-of-the-art of CAC, suggesting insights for future directions and challenges to be addressed.</description>

      <title>RaySplats: Ray Tracing based Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a process that enables the direct creation of 3D objects from 2D images. This representation offers numerous advantages, including rapid training and rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the challenge of incorporating light and shadow reflections, primarily due to the utilization of rasterization rather than ray tracing for rendering. This paper introduces RaySplats, a model that employs ray-tracing based Gaussian Splatting. Rather than utilizing the projection of Gaussians, our method employs a ray-tracing mechanism, operating directly on Gaussian primitives represented by confidence ellipses with RGB colors. In practice, we compute the intersection between ellipses and rays to construct ray-tracing algorithms, facilitating the incorporation of meshes with Gaussian Splatting models and the addition of lights, shadows, and other related effects.</description>

      <title>Integrating Semi-Supervised and Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel active learning approach integrated with an improved semi-supervised learning framework to reduce the cost of manual annotation and enhance model performance. Our proposed approach effectively leverages both the labelled data selected through active learning and the unlabelled data excluded from the selection process. The proposed active learning approach pinpoints areas where the pseudo-labels are likely to be inaccurate. Then, an automatic and efficient pseudo-label auto-refinement (PLAR) module is proposed to correct pixels with potentially erroneous pseudo-labels by comparing their feature representations with those of labelled regions. This approach operates without increasing the labelling budget and is based on the cluster assumption, which states that pixels belonging to the same class should exhibit similar representations in feature space. Furthermore, manual labelling is only applied to the most difficult and uncertain areas in unlabelled data, where insufficient information prevents the PLAR module from making a decision. We evaluated the proposed hybrid semi-supervised active learning framework on two benchmark datasets, one from natural and the other from remote sensing imagery domains. In both cases, it outperformed state-of-the-art methods in the semantic segmentation task.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Error-Optimized Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is a crucial method for content generation. However, it needs a lot of time to sample. Many studies have attempted to use caching to reduce the time consumption of sampling. Existing caching methods accelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and skipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error modules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a sharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity. To solve this problem, we propose the Error-Optimized Cache (EOC). This method introduces three key improvements: (1) Prior knowledge extraction: Extract and process the caching differences; (2) A judgment method for cache optimization: Determine whether certain caching steps need to be optimized; (3) Cache optimization: reduce caching errors. Experiments show that this algorithm significantly reduces the error accumulation caused by caching (especially over-caching). On the ImageNet dataset, without significantly increasing the computational burden, this method improves the quality of the generated images under the over-caching, rule-based, and training-based methods. Specifically, the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) values are improved as follows: from 6.857 to 5.821, from 3.870 to 3.692 and form 3.539 to 3.451 respectively.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Text-to-Video Alignment with Diffusion Latent Beam Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable progress in text-to-video diffusion models enables photorealistic generations, although the contents of the generated video often include unnatural movement or deformation, reverse playback, and motionless scenes. Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some quantity on the goodness of the content. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward, at inference time. We then point out that the improvement of perceptual video quality considering the alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. When evaluating outputs by using vision language models as a proxy of humans, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with evaluation and also depend on the degree of dynamic descriptions in evaluation prompts. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality based on the calibrated reward, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling. We provide practical guidelines on which axes, among search budget, lookahead steps for reward estimate, and denoising steps, in the reverse diffusion process, we should allocate the inference-time computation.</description>

      <title>ContextFormer: Redefining Efficiency in Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation assigns labels to pixels in images, a critical yet challenging task in computer vision. Convolutional methods, although capturing local dependencies well, struggle with long-range relationships. Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in global context capture but are hindered by high computational demands, especially for high-resolution inputs. Most research optimizes the encoder architecture, leaving the bottleneck underexplored - a key area for enhancing performance and efficiency. We propose ContextFormer, a hybrid framework leveraging the strengths of CNNs and ViTs in the bottleneck to balance efficiency, accuracy, and robustness for real-time semantic segmentation. The framework's efficiency is driven by three synergistic modules: the Token Pyramid Extraction Module (TPEM) for hierarchical multi-scale representation, the Transformer and Modulating DepthwiseConv (Trans-MDC) block for dynamic scale-aware feature modeling, and the Feature Merging Module (FMM) for robust integration with enhanced spatial and contextual consistency. Extensive experiments on ADE20K, Pascal Context, CityScapes, and COCO-Stuff datasets show ContextFormer significantly outperforms existing models, achieving state-of-the-art mIoU scores, setting a new benchmark for efficiency and performance. The codes will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Medical Semantic Segmentation with Diffusion Pretrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have shown that learning robust feature representations is critical for the success of many computer vision tasks, including medical image segmentation. In particular, both transformer and convolutional-based architectures have benefit from leveraging pretext tasks for pretraining. However, the adoption of pretext tasks in 3D medical imaging has been less explored and remains a challenge, especially in the context of learning generalizable feature representations.
  We propose a novel pretraining strategy using diffusion models with anatomical guidance, tailored to the intricacies of 3D medical image data. We introduce an auxiliary diffusion process to pretrain a model that produce generalizable feature representations, useful for a variety of downstream segmentation tasks. We employ an additional model that predicts 3D universal body-part coordinates, providing guidance during the diffusion process and improving spatial awareness in generated representations. This approach not only aids in resolving localization inaccuracies but also enriches the model's ability to understand complex anatomical structures.
  Empirical validation on a 13-class organ segmentation task demonstrate the effectiveness of our pretraining technique. It surpasses existing restorative pretraining methods in 3D medical image segmentation by $7.5\%$, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art contrastive pretraining approach, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 67.8 in a non-linear evaluation scenario.</description>

      <title>Imagine with the Teacher: Complete Shape in a Multi-View Distillation Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover the completed 3D shape of an object from its partial observation caused by occlusion, sensor's limitation, noise, etc. When some key semantic information is lost in the incomplete point cloud, the neural network needs to infer the missing part based on the input information. Intuitively we would apply an autoencoder architecture to solve this kind of problem, which take the incomplete point cloud as input and is supervised by the ground truth. This process that develops model's imagination from incomplete shape to complete shape is done automatically in the latent space. But the knowledge for mapping from incomplete to complete still remains dark and could be further explored. Motivated by the knowledge distillation's teacher-student learning strategy, we design a knowledge transfer way for completing 3d shape. In this work, we propose a novel View Distillation Point Completion Network (VD-PCN), which solve the completion problem by a multi-view distillation way. The design methodology fully leverages the orderliness of 2d pixels, flexibleness of 2d processing and powerfulness of 2d network. Extensive evaluations on PCN, ShapeNet55/34, and MVP datasets confirm the effectiveness of our design and knowledge transfer strategy, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Committed to facilitate ongoing research, we will make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Application of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Synthetic Training Data Creation to improve performance of ANN Classifier for extracting Built-Up pixels from Landsat Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training a neural network for pixel based classification task using low resolution Landsat images is difficult as the size of the training data is usually small due to less number of available pixels that represent a single class without any mixing with other classes. Due to this scarcity of training data, neural network may not be able to attain expected level of accuracy. This limitation could be overcome using a generative network that aims to generate synthetic data having the same distribution as the sample data with which it is trained. In this work, we have proposed a methodology for improving the performance of ANN classifier to identify built-up pixels in the Landsat$7$ image with the help of developing a simple GAN architecture that could generate synthetic training pixels when trained using original set of sample built-up pixels. To ensure that the marginal and joint distributions of all the bands corresponding to the generated and original set of pixels are indistinguishable, non-parametric Kolmogorov Smirnov Test and Ball Divergence based Equality of Distributions Test have been performed respectively. It has been observed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the ANN model for built-up classification have continuously improved from $0.9331$ to $0.9983$ and $0.8277$ to $0.9958$ respectively, with the inclusion of generated sets of built-up pixels to the original one.</description>

      <title>Advancing Dense Endoscopic Reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting-driven Surface Normal-aware Tracking and Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for precise surgical interventions and robotic tasks in minimally invasive procedures. While recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved SLAM with high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering, these systems struggle with accurate depth and surface reconstruction due to multi-view inconsistencies. Simply incorporating SLAM and 3DGS leads to mismatches between the reconstructed frames. In this work, we present Endo-2DTAM, a real-time endoscopic SLAM system with 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) to address these challenges. Endo-2DTAM incorporates a surface normal-aware pipeline, which consists of tracking, mapping, and bundle adjustment modules for geometrically accurate reconstruction. Our robust tracking module combines point-to-point and point-to-plane distance metrics, while the mapping module utilizes normal consistency and depth distortion to enhance surface reconstruction quality. We also introduce a pose-consistent strategy for efficient and geometrically coherent keyframe sampling. Extensive experiments on public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo-2DTAM achieves an RMSE of $1.87\pm 0.63$ mm for depth reconstruction of surgical scenes while maintaining computationally efficient tracking, high-quality visual appearance, and real-time rendering. Our code will be released at github.com/lastbasket/Endo-2DTAM.</description>

      <title>A Generic Hybrid Framework for 2D Visual Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a versatile hybrid framework for addressing 2D real-world reconstruction tasks formulated as jigsaw puzzle problems (JPPs) with square, non-overlapping pieces. Our approach integrates a deep learning (DL)-based compatibility measure (CM) model that evaluates pairs of puzzle pieces holistically, rather than focusing solely on their adjacent edges as traditionally done. This DL-based CM is paired with an optimized genetic algorithm (GA)-based solver, which iteratively searches for a global optimal arrangement using the pairwise CM scores of the puzzle pieces. Extensive experimental results highlight the framework's adaptability and robustness across multiple real-world domains. Notably, our unique hybrid methodology achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in reconstructing Portuguese tile panels and large degraded puzzles with eroded boundaries.</description>

      <title>Let Human Sketches Help: Empowering Challenging Image Segmentation Task with Freehand Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sketches, with their expressive potential, allow humans to convey the essence of an object through even a rough contour. For the first time, we harness this expressive potential to improve segmentation performance in challenging tasks like camouflaged object detection (COD). Our approach introduces an innovative sketch-guided interactive segmentation framework, allowing users to intuitively annotate objects with freehand sketches (drawing a rough contour of the object) instead of the traditional bounding boxes or points used in classic interactive segmentation models like SAM. We demonstrate that sketch input can significantly improve performance in existing iterative segmentation methods, outperforming text or bounding box annotations. Additionally, we introduce key modifications to network architectures and a novel sketch augmentation technique to fully harness the power of sketch input and further boost segmentation accuracy. Remarkably, our model' s output can be directly used to train other neural networks, achieving results comparable to pixel-by-pixel annotations--while reducing annotation time by up to 120 times, which shows great potential in democratizing the annotation process and enabling model training with less reliance on resource-intensive, laborious pixel-level annotations. We also present KOSCamo+, the first freehand sketch dataset for camouflaged object detection. The dataset, code, and the labeling tool will be open sourced.</description>

      <title>Consistent Video Colorization via Palette Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorization is a traditional computer vision task and it plays an important role in many time-consuming tasks, such as old film restoration. Existing methods suffer from unsaturated color and temporally inconsistency. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline to overcome the challenges. We regard the colorization task as a generative task and introduce Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) as our base model. We design a palette-based color guider to assist the model in generating vivid and consistent colors. The color context introduced by the palette not only provides guidance for color generation, but also enhances the stability of the generated colors through a unified color context across multiple sequences. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can provide vivid and stable colors for videos, surpassing previous methods.</description>

      <title>PixelWorld: Towards Perceiving Everything as Pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing foundation models typically process visual input as pixels and textual input as tokens, a paradigm that contrasts with human perception, where both modalities are processed in a unified manner. With the rise of embodied and agentic AI, where inputs primarily come from camera pixels, the need for a unified perception framework becomes increasingly evident. In this paper, we propose to unify all modalities (text, tables, code, diagrams, images, etc) as pixel inputs, i.e. "Perceive Everything as Pixels" (PEAP). We introduce PixelWorld, a novel evaluation suite that unifies all the mentioned modalities into pixel space to gauge the existing models' performance. Our findings show that (1) PEAP outperforms baseline with token-based input in multimodal datasets, benefiting from unified input for better disambiguation, (2) significant declines in reasoning and coding capabilities across all models when processing pixel-based input, underscoring the need to enhance foundation models' perceptual abilities, (3) larger models can maintain strong performance on non-reasoning tasks under PEAP, while smaller models like Phi-3.5-V suffer significant performance degradation, (4) the attention pattern of PEAP is highly aligned with text token input, (5) PEAP can be accelerated significantly by exploiting the spatial sparsity. We conclude that the existing frontier models are competent in pixel perception, however, there is still headroom for improvement. Our code, dataset will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>LiDAR Loop Closure Detection using Semantic Graphs with Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection algorithm that uses graph attention neural networks to encode semantic graphs to perform place recognition and then use semantic registration to estimate the 6 DoF relative pose constraint. Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm. For the benefit of the community, we open-source the complete implementation of our proposed algorithm and custom implementation of semantic registration at https://github.com/crepuscularlight/SemanticLoopClosure</description>

      <title>Review and Recommendations for using Artificial Intelligence in Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies hold great promise for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) from intravascular optical coherent tomography (IVOCT) images. Numerous papers have been published describing AI-based models for different diagnostic tasks, yet it remains unclear which models have potential clinical utility and have been properly validated. This systematic review considered published literature between January 2015 and February 2023 describing AI-based diagnosis of CAD using IVOCT. Our search identified 5,576 studies, with 513 included after initial screening and 35 studies included in the final systematic review after quality screening. Our findings indicate that most of the identified models are not currently suitable for clinical use, primarily due to methodological flaws and underlying biases. To address these issues, we provide recommendations to improve model quality and research practices to enhance the development of clinically useful AI products.</description>

      <title>A Radiance Field Loss for Fast and Simple Emissive Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fast and simple technique to convert images into an emissive surface-based scene representation. Building on existing emissive volume reconstruction algorithms, we introduce a subtle yet impactful modification of the loss function requiring changes to only a few lines of code: instead of integrating the radiance field along rays and supervising the resulting images, we project the training images into the scene to directly supervise the spatio-directional radiance field.
  The primary outcome of this change is the complete removal of alpha blending and ray marching from the image formation model, instead moving these steps into the loss computation. In addition to promoting convergence to surfaces, this formulation assigns explicit semantic meaning to 2D subsets of the radiance field, turning them into well-defined emissive surfaces. We finally extract a level set from this representation, which results in a high-quality emissive surface model.
  Our method retains much of the speed and quality of the baseline algorithm. For instance, a suitably modified variant of Instant~NGP maintains comparable computational efficiency, while achieving an average PSNR that is only 0.1 dB lower. Most importantly, our method generates explicit surfaces in place of an exponential volume, doing so with a level of simplicity not seen in prior work.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Upsampling Layer in Hyperspectral Image Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant success in single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SHSR); however, the high spectral dimensionality leads to a heavy computational burden, thus making it difficult to deploy in real-time scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel lightweight SHSR network, i.e., LKCA-Net, that incorporates channel attention to calibrate multi-scale channel features of hyperspectral images. Furthermore, we demonstrate, for the first time, that the low-rank property of the learnable upsampling layer is a key bottleneck in lightweight SHSR methods. To address this, we employ the low-rank approximation strategy to optimize the parameter redundancy of the learnable upsampling layer. Additionally, we introduce a knowledge distillation-based feature alignment technique to ensure the low-rank approximated network retains the same feature representation capacity as the original. We conducted extensive experiments on the Chikusei, Houston 2018, and Pavia Center datasets compared to some SOTAs. The results demonstrate that our method is competitive in performance while achieving speedups of several dozen to even hundreds of times compared to other well-performing SHSR methods.</description>

      <title>Drag Your Gaussian: Effective Drag-Based Editing with Score Distillation for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene editing have been propelled by the rapid development of generative models. Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

      <title>Distillation-Driven Diffusion Model for Multi-Scale MRI Super-Resolution: Make 1.5T MRI Great Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers critical insights into microstructural details, however, the spatial resolution of standard 1.5T imaging systems is often limited. In contrast, 7T MRI provides significantly enhanced spatial resolution, enabling finer visualization of anatomical structures. Though this, the high cost and limited availability of 7T MRI hinder its widespread use in clinical settings. To address this challenge, a novel Super-Resolution (SR) model is proposed to generate 7T-like MRI from standard 1.5T MRI scans. Our approach leverages a diffusion-based architecture, incorporating gradient nonlinearity correction and bias field correction data from 7T imaging as guidance. Moreover, to improve deployability, a progressive distillation strategy is introduced. Specifically, the student model refines the 7T SR task with steps, leveraging feature maps from the inference phase of the teacher model as guidance, aiming to allow the student model to achieve progressively 7T SR performance with a smaller, deployable model size. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline teacher model achieves state-of-the-art SR performance. The student model, while lightweight, sacrifices minimal performance. Furthermore, the student model is capable of accepting MRI inputs at varying resolutions without the need for retraining, significantly further enhancing deployment flexibility. The clinical relevance of our proposed method is validated using clinical data from Massachusetts General Hospital. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZWang78/SR.</description>

      <title>PSO-Net: Development of an automated psoriasis assessment system using attention-based interpretable deep neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that requires long-term treatment and monitoring. Although, the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is utilized as a standard measurement to assess psoriasis severity in clinical trials, it has many drawbacks such as (1) patient burden for in-person clinic visits for assessment of psoriasis, (2) time required for investigator scoring and (3) variability of inter- and intra-rater scoring. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel and interpretable deep learning architecture called PSO-Net, which maps digital images from different anatomical regions to derive attention-based scores. Regional scores are further combined to estimate an absolute PASI score. Moreover, we devise a novel regression activation map for interpretability through ranking attention scores. Using this approach, we achieved inter-class correlation scores of 82.2% [95% CI: 77- 87%] and 87.8% [95% CI: 84-91%] with two different clinician raters, respectively.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial Approach to Register Extreme Resolution Tissue Cleared 3D Brain Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a generative patch based 3D image registration model that can register very high resolution images obtained from a biochemical process name tissue clearing. Tissue clearing process removes lipids and fats from the tissue and make the tissue transparent. When cleared tissues are imaged with Light-sheet fluorescent microscopy, the resulting images give a clear window to the cellular activities and dynamics inside the tissue.Thus the images obtained are very rich with cellular information and hence their resolution is extremely high (eg .2560x2160x676). Analyzing images with such high resolution is a difficult task for any image analysis pipeline.Image registration is a common step in image analysis pipeline when comparison between images are required. Traditional image registration methods fail to register images with such extant. In this paper we addressed this very high resolution image registration issue by proposing a patch-based generative network named InvGAN. Our proposed network can register very high resolution tissue cleared images. The tissue cleared dataset used in this paper are obtained from a tissue clearing protocol named CUBIC. We compared our method both with traditional and deep-learning based registration methods.Two different versions of CUBIC dataset are used, representing two different resolutions 25% and 100% respectively. Experiments on two different resolutions clearly show the impact of resolution on the registration quality. At 25% resolution, our method achieves comparable registration accuracy with very short time (7 minutes approximately). At 100% resolution, most of the traditional registration methods fail except Elastix registration tool.Elastix takes 28 hours to register where proposed InvGAN takes only 10 minutes.</description>

      <title>Pitfalls of defacing whole-head MRI: re-identification risk with diffusion models and compromised research potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defacing is often applied to head magnetic resonance image (MRI) datasets prior to public release to address privacy concerns. The alteration of facial and nearby voxels has provoked discussions about the true capability of these techniques to ensure privacy as well as their impact on downstream tasks. With advancements in deep generative models, the extent to which defacing can protect privacy is uncertain. Additionally, while the altered voxels are known to contain valuable anatomical information, their potential to support research beyond the anatomical regions directly affected by defacing remains uncertain. To evaluate these considerations, we develop a refacing pipeline that recovers faces in defaced head MRIs using cascaded diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). The DPMs are trained on images from 180 subjects and tested on images from 484 unseen subjects, 469 of whom are from a different dataset. To assess whether the altered voxels in defacing contain universally useful information, we also predict computed tomography (CT)-derived skeletal muscle radiodensity from facial voxels in both defaced and original MRIs. The results show that DPMs can generate high-fidelity faces that resemble the original faces from defaced images, with surface distances to the original faces significantly smaller than those of a population average face (p &lt; 0.05). This performance also generalizes well to previously unseen datasets. For skeletal muscle radiodensity predictions, using defaced images results in significantly weaker Spearman's rank correlation coefficients compared to using original images (p &lt; 10-4). For shin muscle, the correlation is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) when using original images but not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05) when any defacing method is applied, suggesting that defacing might not only fail to protect privacy but also eliminate valuable information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has gained significant attention in contemporary applications, particularly due to the scarcity of labeled data. While existing SSL methodologies primarily address feature variance and linear correlations, they often neglect the intricate relations between samples and the nonlinear dependencies inherent in complex data. In this paper, we introduce Correlation-Dependence Self-Supervised Learning (CDSSL), a novel framework that unifies and extends existing SSL paradigms by integrating both linear correlations and nonlinear dependencies, encapsulating sample-wise and feature-wise interactions. Our approach incorporates the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to robustly capture nonlinear dependencies within a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, enriching representation learning. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of CDSSL in improving representation quality.</description>

      <title>Full-scale Representation Guided Network for Retinal Vessel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The U-Net architecture and its variants have remained state-of-the-art (SOTA) for retinal vessel segmentation over the past decade. In this study, we introduce a Full Scale Guided Network (FSG-Net), where the feature representation network with modernized convolution blocks extracts full-scale information and the guided convolution block refines that information. Attention-guided filter is introduced to the guided convolution block under the interpretation that the filter behaves like the unsharp mask filter. Passing full-scale information to the attention block allows for the generation of improved attention maps, which are then passed to the attention-guided filter, resulting in performance enhancement of the segmentation network. The structure preceding the guided convolution block can be replaced by any U-Net variant, which enhances the scalability of the proposed approach. For a fair comparison, we re-implemented recent studies available in public repositories to evaluate their scalability and reproducibility. Our experiments also show that the proposed network demonstrates competitive results compared to current SOTA models on various public datasets. Ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with much smaller parameter sizes. Lastly, by applying the proposed model to facial wrinkle segmentation, we confirmed the potential for scalability to similar tasks in other domains. Our code is available on https://github.com/ZombaSY/FSG-Net-pytorch.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prompt: Unlocking the Power of Visual Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has recently emerged as a powerful method for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks. By introducing learnable prompt tokens as task-specific instructions, VPT effectively guides pre-trained transformer models with minimal overhead. Despite its empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of VPT remains an active area of research. Building on recent insights into the connection between mixture of experts and prompt-based approaches, we identify a key limitation in VPT: the restricted functional expressiveness in prompt formulation. To address this limitation, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompt Tuning (VAPT), a new generation of prompts that redefines prompts as adaptive functions of the input. Our theoretical analysis shows that this simple yet intuitive approach achieves optimal sample efficiency. Empirical results on VTAB-1K and FGVC further demonstrate VAPT's effectiveness, with performance gains of 7.34% and 1.04% over fully fine-tuning baselines, respectively. Notably, VAPT also surpasses VPT by a substantial margin while using fewer parameters. These results highlight both the effectiveness and efficiency of our method and pave the way for future research to explore the potential of adaptive prompts.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Targets for Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models and Where To Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk of harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the concept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one concept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric properties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is confined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) method, which \emph{dynamically} selects optimal target concepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side effects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while maintaining effective erasure performance. Our code is published at {https://github.com/tuananhbui89/Adaptive-Guided-Erasure}.</description>

      <title>Understanding Model Calibration -- A gentle introduction and visual exploration of calibration and the expected calibration error (ECE)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To be considered reliable, a model must be calibrated so that its confidence in each decision closely reflects its true outcome. In this blogpost we'll take a look at the most commonly used definition for calibration and then dive into a frequently used evaluation measure for model calibration. We'll then cover some of the drawbacks of this measure and how these surfaced the need for additional notions of calibration, which require their own new evaluation measures. This post is not intended to be an in-depth dissection of all works on calibration, nor does it focus on how to calibrate models. Instead, it is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the different notions and their evaluation measures as well as to re-highlight some issues with a measure that is still widely used to evaluate calibration.</description>

      <title>The Role of Graph-based MIL and Interventional Training in the Generalization of WSI Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole Slide Imaging (WSI), which involves high-resolution digital scans of pathology slides, has become the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, but its gigapixel resolution and the scarcity of annotated datasets present challenges for deep learning models. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a widely-used weakly supervised approach, bypasses the need for patch-level annotations. However, conventional MIL methods overlook the spatial relationships between patches, which are crucial for tasks such as cancer grading and diagnosis. To address this, graph-based approaches have gained prominence by incorporating spatial information through node connections. Despite their potential, both MIL and graph-based models are vulnerable to learning spurious associations, like color variations in WSIs, affecting their robustness. In this dissertation, we conduct an extensive comparison of multiple graph construction techniques, MIL models, graph-MIL approaches, and interventional training, introducing a new framework, Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning with Interventional Training (GMIL-IT), for WSI classification. We evaluate their impact on model generalization through domain shift analysis and demonstrate that graph-based models alone achieve the generalization initially anticipated from interventional training.

      <title>Imitation Game for Adversarial Disillusion with Multimodal Generative Chain-of-Thought Role-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the cornerstone of artificial intelligence, machine perception confronts a fundamental threat posed by adversarial illusions. These adversarial attacks manifest in two primary forms: deductive illusion, where specific stimuli are crafted based on the victim model's general decision logic, and inductive illusion, where the victim model's general decision logic is shaped by specific stimuli. The former exploits the model's decision boundaries to create a stimulus that, when applied, interferes with its decision-making process. The latter reinforces a conditioned reflex in the model, embedding a backdoor during its learning phase that, when triggered by a stimulus, causes aberrant behaviours. The multifaceted nature of adversarial illusions calls for a unified defence framework, addressing vulnerabilities across various forms of attack. In this study, we propose a disillusion paradigm based on the concept of an imitation game. At the heart of the imitation game lies a multimodal generative agent, steered by chain-of-thought reasoning, which observes, internalises and reconstructs the semantic essence of a sample, liberated from the classic pursuit of reversing the sample to its original state. As a proof of concept, we conduct experimental simulations using a multimodal generative dialogue agent and evaluates the methodology under a variety of attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>Improving Multi-Label Contrastive Learning by Leveraging Label Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-label learning, leveraging contrastive learning to learn better representations faces a key challenge: selecting positive and negative samples and effectively utilizing label information. Previous studies selected positive and negative samples based on the overlap between labels and used them for label-wise loss balancing. However, these methods suffer from a complex selection process and fail to account for the varying importance of different labels. To address these problems, we propose a novel method that improves multi-label contrastive learning through label distribution. Specifically, when selecting positive and negative samples, we only need to consider whether there is an intersection between labels. To model the relationships between labels, we introduce two methods to recover label distributions from logical labels, based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) and contrastive loss, respectively. We evaluate our method on nine widely used multi-label datasets, including image and vector datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in six evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Augmented Intelligence for Multimodal Virtual Biopsy in Breast Cancer Using Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) is the primary imaging modality for routine breast cancer screening; however, its effectiveness is limited in patients with dense breast tissue or fibrocystic conditions. Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM), a second-level imaging technique, offers enhanced accuracy in tumor detection. Nonetheless, its application is restricted due to higher radiation exposure, the use of contrast agents, and limited accessibility. As a result, CESM is typically reserved for select cases, leaving many patients to rely solely on FFDM despite the superior diagnostic performance of CESM. While biopsy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, it is an invasive procedure that can cause discomfort for patients. We introduce a multimodal, multi-view deep learning approach for virtual biopsy, integrating FFDM and CESM modalities in craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views to classify lesions as malignant or benign. To address the challenge of missing CESM data, we leverage generative artificial intelligence to impute CESM images from FFDM scans. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating the CESM modality is crucial to enhance the performance of virtual biopsy. When real CESM data is missing, synthetic CESM images proved effective, outperforming the use of FFDM alone, particularly in multimodal configurations that combine FFDM and CESM modalities. The proposed approach has the potential to improve diagnostic workflows, providing clinicians with augmented intelligence tools to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. Additionally, as a contribution to the research community, we publicly release the dataset used in our experiments, facilitating further advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>Single cell resolution 3D imaging and segmentation within intact live tissues</title>

Abstract: Epithelial cells form diverse structures from squamous spherical organoids to densely packed pseudostratified tissues. Quantification of cellular properties in these contexts requires high-resolution deep imaging and computational techniques to achieve truthful three-dimensional (3D) structural features. Here, we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for sample preparation, imaging and deep-learning-assisted cell segmentation to achieve accurate quantification of fluorescently labelled individual cells in 3D within live tissues. We share the lessons learned through troubleshooting 3D imaging of Drosophila wing discs, including considerations on the choice of microscopy modality and settings (objective, sample mounting) and available segmentation methods. In addition, we include a computational pipeline alongside custom code to assist replication of the protocol. While we focus on the segmentation of cell outlines from membrane labelling, this protocol applies to a wide variety of samples, and we believe it be valuable for studying other tissues that demand complex analysis in 3D.</description>

      <title>Neuro-LIFT: A Neuromorphic, LLM-based Interactive Framework for Autonomous Drone FlighT at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of human-intuitive interactions into autonomous systems has been limited. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle with context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot interaction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication through speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and robotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central focus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly being leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation algorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while effective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption and latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic vision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency navigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these systems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In this work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework implemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural language processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its capabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to human instructions in real-time.</description>

      <title>Capturing Temporal Dynamics in Large-Scale Canopy Tree Height Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise in global greenhouse gas emissions, accurate large-scale tree canopy height maps are essential for understanding forest structure, estimating above-ground biomass, and monitoring ecological disruptions. To this end, we present a novel approach to generate large-scale, high-resolution canopy height maps over time. Our model accurately predicts canopy height over multiple years given Sentinel-2 time series satellite data. Using GEDI LiDAR data as the ground truth for training the model, we present the first 10m resolution temporal canopy height map of the European continent for the period 2019-2022. As part of this product, we also offer a detailed canopy height map for 2020, providing more precise estimates than previous studies. Our pipeline and the resulting temporal height map are publicly available, enabling comprehensive large-scale monitoring of forests and, hence, facilitating future research and ecological analyses.

      <title>Homogeneity Bias as Differential Sampling Uncertainty in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior research show that Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) represent marginalized groups more homogeneously than dominant groups. However, the mechanisms underlying this homogeneity bias remain relatively unexplored. We propose that this bias emerges from systematic differences in the probability distributions from which tokens are sampled at inference-time. Analyzing three measures of uncertainty in token sampling distributions-entropy, perplexity, and probability of differentiation-we find that in some models, specifically GPT-4 Turbo and Llama-3.2, tokens are sampled more deterministically when generating texts about marginalized groups (i.e., Black Americans and women) compared to their dominant group counterparts (i.e., White Americans and men). While these findings may help explain homogeneity bias in certain models, the patterns did not replicate across all VLMs tested, suggesting multiple mechanisms may contribute to homogeneity bias in AI.</description>

      <title>Pathological MRI Segmentation by Synthetic Pathological Data Generation in Fetuses and Neonates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing new methods for the automated analysis of clinical fetal and neonatal MRI data is limited by the scarcity of annotated pathological datasets and privacy concerns that often restrict data sharing, hindering the effectiveness of deep learning models. We address this in two ways. First, we introduce Fetal&amp;Neonatal-DDPM, a novel diffusion model framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic pathological fetal and neonatal MRIs from semantic label images. Second, we enhance training data by modifying healthy label images through morphological alterations to simulate conditions such as ventriculomegaly, cerebellar and pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and microcephaly. By leveraging Fetal&amp;Neonatal-DDPM, we synthesize realistic pathological MRIs from these modified pathological label images. Radiologists rated the synthetic MRIs as significantly (p &lt; 0.05) superior in quality and diagnostic value compared to real MRIs, demonstrating features such as blood vessels and choroid plexus, and improved alignment with label annotations. Synthetic pathological data enhanced state-of-the-art nnUNet segmentation performance, particularly for severe ventriculomegaly cases, with the greatest improvements achieved in ventricle segmentation (Dice scores: 0.9253 vs. 0.7317). This study underscores the potential of generative AI as transformative tool for data augmentation, offering improved segmentation performance in pathological cases. This development represents a significant step towards improving analysis and segmentation accuracy in prenatal imaging, and also offers new ways for data anonymization through the generation of pathologic image data.</description>

      <title>Do Large Multimodal Models Solve Caption Generation for Scientific Figures? Lessons Learned from SCICAP Challenge 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the SCICAP datasets launch in 2021, the research community has made significant progress in generating captions for scientific figures in scholarly articles. In 2023, the first SCICAP Challenge took place, inviting global teams to use an expanded SCICAP dataset to develop models for captioning diverse figure types across various academic fields. At the same time, text generation models advanced quickly, with many powerful pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) emerging that showed impressive capabilities in various vision-and-language tasks. This paper presents an overview of the first SCICAP Challenge and details the performance of various models on its data, capturing a snapshot of the fields state. We found that professional editors overwhelmingly preferred figure captions generated by GPT-4V over those from all other models and even the original captions written by authors. Following this key finding, we conducted detailed analyses to answer this question: Have advanced LMMs solved the task of generating captions for scientific figures?</description>

      <title>Using gradient of Lagrangian function to compute efficient channels for the ideal observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the Bayesian ideal observer (IO) should be used to guide the objective assessment and optimization of medical imaging systems. The IO employs complete task-specific information to compute test statistics for making inference decisions and performs optimally in signal detection tasks. However, the IO test statistic typically depends non-linearly on the image data and cannot be analytically determined. The ideal linear observer, known as the Hotelling observer (HO), can sometimes be used as a surrogate for the IO. However, when image data are high dimensional, HO computation can be difficult. Efficient channels that can extract task-relevant features have been investigated to reduce the dimensionality of image data to approximate IO and HO performance. This work proposes a novel method for generating efficient channels by use of the gradient of a Lagrangian-based loss function that was designed to learn the HO. The generated channels are referred to as the Lagrangian-gradient (L-grad) channels. Numerical studies are conducted that consider binary signal detection tasks involving various backgrounds and signals. It is demonstrated that channelized HO (CHO) using L-grad channels can produce significantly better signal detection performance compared to the CHO using PLS channels. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed L-grad method can achieve significantly lower computation time compared to the PLS method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frame Blind Manifold Deconvolution for Rotating Synthetic Aperture Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating synthetic aperture (RSA) imaging system captures images of the target scene at different rotation angles by rotating a rectangular aperture. Deblurring acquired RSA images plays a critical role in reconstructing a latent sharp image underlying the scene. In the past decade, the emergence of blind convolution technology has revolutionised this field by its ability to model complex features from acquired images. Most of the existing methods attempt to solve the above ill-posed inverse problem through maximising a posterior.
  Despite this progress, researchers have paid limited attention to exploring low-dimensional manifold structures of the latent image within a high-dimensional ambient-space. Here, we propose a novel method to process RSA images using manifold fitting and penalisation in the content of multi-frame blind convolution. We develop fast algorithms for implementing the proposed procedure. Simulation studies demonstrate that manifold-based deconvolution can outperform conventional deconvolution algorithms in the sense that it can generate a sharper estimate of the latent image in terms of estimating pixel intensities and preserving structural details.</description>

      <title>In-distribution adversarial attacks on object recognition models using gradient-free search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.16198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks are susceptible to small perturbations in the form of 2D rotations and shifts, image crops, and even changes in object colors. Past works attribute these errors to dataset bias, claiming that models fail on these perturbed samples as they do not belong to the training data distribution. Here, we challenge this claim and present evidence of the widespread existence of perturbed images within the training data distribution, which networks fail to classify. We train models on data sampled from parametric distributions, then search inside this data distribution to find such in-distribution adversarial examples. This is done using our gradient-free evolution strategies (ES) based approach which we call CMA-Search. Despite training with a large-scale (0.5 million images), unbiased dataset of camera and light variations, CMA-Search can find a failure inside the data distribution in over 71% cases by perturbing the camera position. With lighting changes, CMA-Search finds misclassifications in 42% cases. These findings also extend to natural images from ImageNet and Co3D datasets. This phenomenon of in-distribution images presents a highly worrisome problem for artificial intelligence -- they bypass the need for a malicious agent to add engineered noise to induce an adversarial attack. All code, datasets, and demos are available at https://github.com/Spandan-Madan/in_distribution_adversarial_examples.</description>

Abstract: Regulatory compliance auditing across diverse industrial domains requires heightened quality assurance and traceability. Present manual and intermittent approaches to such auditing yield significant challenges, potentially leading to oversights in the monitoring process. To address these issues, we introduce a real-time, multi-modal sensing system employing 3D time-of-flight and RGB cameras, coupled with unsupervised learning techniques on edge AI devices. This enables continuous object tracking thereby enhancing efficiency in record-keeping and minimizing manual interventions. While we validate the system in a knife sanitization context within agrifood facilities, emphasizing its prowess against occlusion and low-light issues with RGB cameras, its potential spans various industrial monitoring settings.</description>

      <title>Robust Novelty Detection through Style-Conscious Feature Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novelty detection seeks to identify samples deviating from a known distribution, yet data shifts in a multitude of ways, and only a few consist of relevant changes. Aligned with out-of-distribution generalization literature, we advocate for a formal distinction between task-relevant semantic or content changes and irrelevant style changes. This distinction forms the basis for robust novelty detection, emphasizing the identification of semantic changes resilient to style distributional shifts. To this end, we introduce Stylist, a method that utilizes pretrained large-scale model representations to selectively discard environment-biased features. By computing per-feature scores based on feature distribution distances between environments, Stylist effectively eliminates features responsible for spurious correlations, enhancing novelty detection performance. Evaluations on adapted domain generalization datasets and a synthetic dataset demonstrate Stylist's efficacy in improving novelty detection across diverse datasets with stylistic and content shifts. The code is available at https://github.com/bit-ml/Stylist.</description>

      <title>RealCraft: Attention Control as A Tool for Zero-Shot Consistent Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even though large-scale text-to-image generative models show promising performance in synthesizing high-quality images, applying these models directly to image editing remains a significant challenge. This challenge is further amplified in video editing due to the additional dimension of time. This is especially the case for editing real-world videos as it necessitates maintaining a stable structural layout across frames while executing localized edits without disrupting the existing content. In this paper, we propose RealCraft, an attention-control-based method for zero-shot real-world video editing. By swapping cross-attention for new feature injection and relaxing spatial-temporal attention of the editing object, we achieve localized shape-wise edit along with enhanced temporal consistency. Our model directly uses Stable Diffusion and operates without the need for additional information. We showcase the proposed zero-shot attention-control-based method across a range of videos, demonstrating shape-wise, time-consistent and parameter-free editing in videos of up to 64 frames.</description>

      <title>HeadCraft: Modeling High-Detail Shape Variations for Animated 3DMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current advances in human head modeling allow the generation of plausible-looking 3D head models via neural representations, such as NeRFs and SDFs. Nevertheless, constructing complete high-fidelity head models with explicitly controlled animation remains an issue. Furthermore, completing the head geometry based on a partial observation, e.g., coming from a depth sensor, while preserving a high level of detail is often problematic for the existing methods. We introduce a generative model for detailed 3D head meshes on top of an articulated 3DMM, simultaneously allowing explicit animation and high-detail preservation. Our method is trained in two stages. First, we register a parametric head model with vertex displacements to each mesh of the recently introduced NPHM dataset of accurate 3D head scans. The estimated displacements are baked into a hand-crafted UV layout. Second, we train a StyleGAN model to generalize over the UV maps of displacements, which we later refer to as HeadCraft. The decomposition of the parametric model and high-quality vertex displacements allows us to animate the model and modify the regions semantically. We demonstrate the results of unconditional sampling, fitting to a scan and editing. The project page is available at https://seva100.github.io/headcraft.</description>

Abstract: Medical data collected for diagnostic decisions are typically multimodal, providing comprehensive information on a subject. While computer-aided diagnosis systems can benefit from multimodal inputs, effectively fusing such data remains a challenging task and a key focus in medical research. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based framework, called Alifuse, for aligning and fusing multimodal medical data. Specifically, we convert medical images and both unstructured and structured clinical records into vision and language tokens, employing intramodal and intermodal attention mechanisms to learn unified representations of all imaging and non-imaging data for classification. Additionally, we integrate restoration modeling with contrastive learning frameworks, jointly learning the high-level semantic alignment between images and texts and the low-level understanding of one modality with the help of another. We apply Alifuse to classify Alzheimer's disease, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five public datasets and outperforming eight baselines.</description>

Abstract: Considering the close connection between action recognition and human pose estimation, we design a Collaboratively Self-supervised Video Representation (CSVR) learning framework specific to action recognition by jointly factoring in generative pose prediction and discriminative context matching as pretext tasks. Specifically, our CSVR consists of three branches: a generative pose prediction branch, a discriminative context matching branch, and a video generating branch. Among them, the first one encodes dynamic motion feature by utilizing Conditional-GAN to predict the human poses of future frames, and the second branch extracts static context features by contrasting positive and negative video feature and I-frame feature pairs. The third branch is designed to generate both current and future video frames, for the purpose of collaboratively improving dynamic motion features and static context features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple popular video datasets.</description>

      <title>BinaryDM: Accurate Weight Binarization for Efficient Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05662v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advancement of diffusion models (DMs) and the substantially increased computational requirements, quantization emerges as a practical solution to obtain compact and efficient low-bit DMs. However, the highly discrete representation leads to severe accuracy degradation, hindering the quantization of diffusion models to ultra-low bit-widths. This paper proposes a novel weight binarization approach for DMs, namely BinaryDM, pushing binarized DMs to be accurate and efficient by improving the representation and optimization. From the representation perspective, we present an Evolvable-Basis Binarizer (EBB) to enable a smooth evolution of DMs from full-precision to accurately binarized. EBB enhances information representation in the initial stage through the flexible combination of multiple binary bases and applies regularization to evolve into efficient single-basis binarization. The evolution only occurs in the head and tail of the DM architecture to retain the stability of training. From the optimization perspective, a Low-rank Representation Mimicking (LRM) is applied to assist the optimization of binarized DMs. The LRM mimics the representations of full-precision DMs in low-rank space, alleviating the direction ambiguity of the optimization process caused by fine-grained alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinaryDM achieves significant accuracy and efficiency gains compared to SOTA quantization methods of DMs under ultra-low bit-widths. With 1-bit weight and 4-bit activation (W1A4), BinaryDM achieves as low as 7.74 FID and saves the performance from collapse (baseline FID 10.87). As the first binarization method for diffusion models, W1A4 BinaryDM achieves impressive 15.2x OPs and 29.2x model size savings, showcasing its substantial potential for edge deployment.

      <title>Residual Connections Harm Generative Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that introducing a weighting factor to reduce the influence of identity shortcuts in residual networks significantly enhances semantic feature learning in generative representation learning frameworks, such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) and diffusion models. Our modification notably improves feature quality, raising ImageNet-1K K-Nearest Neighbor accuracy from 27.4% to 63.9% and linear probing accuracy from 67.8% to 72.7% for MAEs with a ViT-B/16 backbone, while also enhancing generation quality in diffusion models. This significant gap suggests that, while residual connection structure serves an essential role in facilitating gradient propagation, it may have a harmful side effect of reducing capacity for abstract learning by virtue of injecting an echo of shallower representations into deeper layers. We ameliorate this downside via a fixed formula for monotonically decreasing the contribution of identity connections as layer depth increases. Our design promotes the gradual development of feature abstractions, without impacting network trainability. Analyzing the representations learned by our modified residual networks, we find correlation between low effective feature rank and downstream task performance.</description>

      <title>MTGA: Multi-View Temporal Granularity Aligned Aggregation for Event-Based Lip-Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lip-reading is to utilize the visual information of the speaker's lip movements to recognize words and sentences. Existing event-based lip-reading solutions integrate different frame rate branches to learn spatio-temporal features of varying granularities. However, aggregating events into event frames inevitably leads to the loss of fine-grained temporal information within frames. To remedy this drawback, we propose a novel framework termed Multi-view Temporal Granularity aligned Aggregation (MTGA). Specifically, we first present a novel event representation method, namely time-segmented voxel graph list, where the most significant local voxels are temporally connected into a graph list. Then we design a spatio-temporal fusion module based on temporal granularity alignment, where the global spatial features extracted from event frames, together with the local relative spatial and temporal features contained in voxel graph list are effectively aligned and integrated. Finally, we design a temporal aggregation module that incorporates positional encoding, which enables the capture of local absolute spatial and global temporal information. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both the event-based and video-based lip-reading counterparts.</description>

      <title>Contextual Emotion Recognition using Large Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "How does the person in the bounding box feel?" Achieving human-level recognition of the apparent emotion of a person in real world situations remains an unsolved task in computer vision. Facial expressions are not enough: body pose, contextual knowledge, and commonsense reasoning all contribute to how humans perform this emotional theory of mind task. In this paper, we examine two major approaches enabled by recent large vision language models: 1) image captioning followed by a language-only LLM, and 2) vision language models, under zero-shot and fine-tuned setups. We evaluate the methods on the Emotions in Context (EMOTIC) dataset and demonstrate that a vision language model, fine-tuned even on a small dataset, can significantly outperform traditional baselines. The results of this work aim to help robots and agents perform emotionally sensitive decision-making and interaction in the future.</description>

      <title>LlavaGuard: An Open VLM-based Framework for Safeguarding Vision Datasets and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces LlavaGuard, a suite of VLM-based vision safeguards that address the critical need for reliable guardrails in the era of large-scale data and models. To this end, we establish a novel open framework, describing a customizable safety taxonomy, data preprocessing, augmentation, and training setup. For teaching a VLM safeguard on safety, we further create a multimodal safety dataset with high-quality human expert annotations, where each image is labeled with a safety rating, category and rationale. We also employ advanced augmentations to support context-specific assessments. The resulting LlavaGuard models, ranging from 0.5B to 7B, serve as a versatile tool for evaluating the safety compliance of visual content against flexible policies. In comprehensive experiments, LlavaGuard outperforms both state-of-the-art safeguards and VLMs in accuracy and in flexibly handling different policies. Additionally, we demonstrate LlavaGuard's performance in two real-world applications: large-scale dataset annotation and moderation of text-to-image models. We make our entire framework publicly available, including the dataset and model weights.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-OCC: Uncertainty-Aware Camera-based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11021v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of autonomous vehicle perception, comprehending 3D scenes is paramount for tasks such as planning and mapping. Camera-based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction (OCC) aims to infer scene geometry and semantics from limited observations. While it has gained popularity due to affordability and rich visual cues, existing methods often neglect the inherent uncertainty in models. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware OCC method ($\alpha$-OCC). We first introduce Depth-UP, an uncertainty propagation framework that improves geometry completion by up to 11.58\% and semantic segmentation by up to 12.95\% across various OCC models. For uncertainty quantification (UQ), we propose the hierarchical conformal prediction (HCP) method, effectively handling the high-level class imbalance in OCC datasets. On the geometry level, the novel KL-based score function significantly improves the occupied recall (45\%) of safety-critical classes with minimal performance overhead (3.4\% reduction). On UQ, our HCP achieves smaller prediction set sizes while maintaining the defined coverage guarantee. Compared with baselines, it reduces up to 92\% set size, with 18\% further reduction when integrated with Depth-UP. Our contributions advance OCC accuracy and robustness, marking a noteworthy step forward in autonomous perception systems.</description>

      <title>SituationalLLM: Proactive language models with scene awareness for dynamic, contextual task guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in text-based tasks but often struggle to provide actionable guidance in real-world physical environments. This is because of their inability to recognize their limited understanding of the user's physical context. We present SituationalLLM, a novel approach that integrates structured scene information into an LLM to deliver proactive, context-aware assistance. By encoding objects, attributes, and relationships in a custom Scene Graph Language, SituationalLLM actively identifies gaps in environmental context and seeks clarifications during user interactions. This behavior emerges from training on the Situational Awareness Database for Instruct-Tuning (SAD-Instruct), which combines diverse, scenario-specific scene graphs with iterative, dialogue-based refinements. Experimental results indicate that SituationalLLM outperforms generic LLM baselines in task specificity, reliability, and adaptability, paving the way for environment-aware AI assistants capable of delivering robust, user-centric guidance under real-world constraints.</description>

      <title>RoVRM: A Robust Visual Reward Model Optimized via Auxiliary Textual Preference Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) often fail to align with human preferences, leading to issues like generating misleading content without proper visual context (also known as hallucination). A promising solution to this problem is using human-preference alignment techniques, such as best-of-n sampling and reinforcement learning. However, these techniques face the difficulty arising from the scarcity of visual preference data, which is required to train a visual reward model (VRM). In this work, we continue the line of research. We present a Robust Visual Reward Model (RoVRM) which improves human-preference alignment for LVLMs. RoVRM leverages auxiliary textual preference data through a three-phase progressive training and optimal transport-based preference data selection to effectively mitigate the scarcity of visual preference data. We experiment with RoVRM on the commonly used vision-language tasks based on the LLaVA-1.5-7B and -13B models. Experimental results demonstrate that RoVRM consistently outperforms traditional VRMs. Furthermore, our three-phase progressive training and preference data selection approaches can yield consistent performance gains over ranking-based alignment techniques, such as direct preference optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for generalizing across diverse tasks and using language cues to enhance learning. While transformer-based architectures have been the de facto in vision-language training, they face challenges like quadratic computational complexity, high GPU memory usage, and difficulty with long-term dependencies. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaVL, a novel model that leverages recent advancements in selective state space modality fusion to efficiently capture long-range dependencies and learn joint representations for vision and language data. MambaVL utilizes a shared state transition matrix across both modalities, allowing the model to capture information about actions from multiple perspectives within the scene. Furthermore, we propose a question-answering task that helps guide the model toward relevant cues. These questions provide critical information about actions, objects, and environmental context, leading to enhanced performance. As a result, MambaVL achieves state-of-the-art performance in action recognition on the Epic-Kitchens-100 dataset and outperforms baseline methods in action anticipation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sensor Deep Learning for Glacier Mapping</title>

Abstract: The more than 200,000 glaciers outside the ice sheets play a crucial role in our society by influencing sea-level rise, water resource management, natural hazards, biodiversity, and tourism. However, only a fraction of these glaciers benefit from consistent and detailed in-situ observations that allow for assessing their status and changes over time. This limitation can, in part, be overcome by relying on satellite-based Earth Observation techniques. Satellite-based glacier mapping applications have historically mainly relied on manual and semi-automatic detection methods, while recently, a fast and notable transition to deep learning techniques has started.
  This chapter reviews how combining multi-sensor remote sensing data and deep learning allows us to better delineate (i.e. map) glaciers and detect their temporal changes. We explain how relying on deep learning multi-sensor frameworks to map glaciers benefits from the extensive availability of regional and global glacier inventories. We also analyse the rationale behind glacier mapping, the benefits of deep learning methodologies, and the inherent challenges in integrating multi-sensor earth observation data with deep learning algorithms.
  While our review aims to provide a broad overview of glacier mapping efforts, we highlight a few setups where deep learning multi-sensor remote sensing applications have a considerable potential added value. This includes applications for debris-covered and rock glaciers that are visually difficult to distinguish from surroundings and for calving glaciers that are in contact with the ocean. These specific cases are illustrated through a series of visual imageries, highlighting some significant advantages and challenges when detecting glacier changes, including dealing with seasonal snow cover, changing debris coverage, and distinguishing glacier fronts from the surrounding sea ice.</description>

      <title>Oryx MLLM: On-Demand Spatial-Temporal Understanding at Arbitrary Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual data comes in various forms, ranging from small icons of just a few pixels to long videos spanning hours. Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously.

      <title>HarmoniCa: Harmonizing Training and Inference for Better Feature Caching in Diffusion Transformer Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel in generative tasks but face practical deployment challenges due to high inference costs. Feature caching, which stores and retrieves redundant computations, offers the potential for acceleration. Existing learning-based caching, though adaptive, overlooks the impact of the prior timestep. It also suffers from misaligned objectives--aligned predicted noise vs. high-quality images--between training and inference. These two discrepancies compromise both performance and efficiency. To this end, we harmonize training and inference with a novel learning-based caching framework dubbed HarmoniCa. It first incorporates Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) to ensure the continuity of the denoising process, where prior steps can be leveraged. In addition, an Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO) is applied to balance image quality against cache utilization through an efficient proxy to approximate the image error. Extensive experiments across $8$ models, $4$ samplers, and resolutions from $256\times256$ to $2K$ demonstrate superior performance and speedup of our framework. For instance, it achieves over $40\%$ latency reduction (i.e., $2.07\times$ theoretical speedup) and improved performance on PixArt-$\alpha$. Remarkably, our image-free approach reduces training time by $25\%$ compared with the previous method.</description>

      <title>LANTERN: Accelerating Visual Autoregressive Models with Relaxed Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auto-Regressive (AR) models have recently gained prominence in image generation, often matching or even surpassing the performance of diffusion models. However, one major limitation of AR models is their sequential nature, which processes tokens one at a time, slowing down generation compared to models like GANs or diffusion-based methods that operate more efficiently. While speculative decoding has proven effective for accelerating LLMs by generating multiple tokens in a single forward, its application in visual AR models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a challenge in this setting, which we term \textit{token selection ambiguity}, wherein visual AR models frequently assign uniformly low probabilities to tokens, hampering the performance of speculative decoding. To overcome this challenge, we propose a relaxed acceptance condition referred to as LANTERN that leverages the interchangeability of tokens in latent space. This relaxation restores the effectiveness of speculative decoding in visual AR models by enabling more flexible use of candidate tokens that would otherwise be prematurely rejected. Furthermore, by incorporating a total variation distance bound, we ensure that these speed gains are achieved without significantly compromising image quality or semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in providing a substantial speed-up over speculative decoding. In specific, compared to a na\"ive application of the state-of-the-art speculative decoding, LANTERN increases speed-ups by $\mathbf{1.75}\times$ and $\mathbf{1.82}\times$, as compared to greedy decoding and random sampling, respectively, when applied to LlamaGen, a contemporary visual AR model.</description>

Abstract: To learn large sets of scenes, Tri-Planes are commonly employed for their planar structure that enables an interoperability with image models, and thus diverse 3D applications. However, this advantage comes at the cost of resource efficiency, as Tri-Planes are not the most computationally efficient option. In this paper, we introduce Fused-Planes, a new planar architecture that improves Tri-Planes resource-efficiency in the framework of learning large sets of scenes, which we call "multi-scene inverse graphics". To learn a large set of scenes, our method divides it into two subsets and operates as follows: (i) we train the first subset of scenes jointly with a compression model, (ii) we use that compression model to learn the remaining scenes. This compression model consists of a 3D-aware latent space in which Fused-Planes are learned, enabling a reduced rendering resolution, and shared structures across scenes that reduce scene representation complexity. Fused-Planes present competitive resource costs in multi-scene inverse graphics, while preserving Tri-Planes rendering quality, and maintaining their widely favored planar structure. Our codebase is publicly available as open-source. Our project page can be found at https://fused-planes.github.io .</description>

      <title>Interpretable Measurement of CNN Deep Feature Density using Copula and the Generalized Characteristic Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel empirical approach toward measuring the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the deep features of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Measurement of the deep feature PDF is a valuable problem for several reasons. Notably, a. Understanding the deep feature PDF yields new insight into deep representations. b. Feature density methods are important for tasks such as anomaly detection which can improve the robustness of deep learning models in the wild. Interpretable measurement of the deep feature PDF is challenging due to the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD), and the Spatial intuition Limitation. Our novel measurement technique combines copula analysis with the Method of Orthogonal Moments (MOM), in order to directly measure the Generalized Characteristic Function (GCF) of the multivariate deep feature PDF. We find that, surprisingly, the one-dimensional marginals of non-negative deep CNN features after major blocks are not well approximated by a Gaussian distribution, and that these features increasingly approximate an exponential distribution with increasing network depth. Furthermore, we observe that deep features become increasingly independent with increasing network depth within their typical ranges. However, we surprisingly also observe that many deep features exhibit strong dependence (either correlation or anti-correlation) with other extremely strong detections, even if these features are independent within typical ranges. We elaborate on these findings in our discussion, where we propose a new hypothesis that exponentially infrequent large valued features correspond to strong computer vision detections of semantic targets, which would imply that these large-valued features are not outliers but rather an important detection signal.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Subspace Decomposition for Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-generated images (AIGIs), such as natural or face images, have become increasingly realistic and indistinguishable, making their detection a critical and pressing challenge. In this paper, we start from a new perspective to excavate the reason behind the failure generalization in AIGI detection, named the \textit{asymmetry phenomenon}, where a naively trained detector tends to favor overfitting to the limited and monotonous fake patterns, causing the feature space to become highly constrained and low-ranked, which is proved seriously limiting the expressivity and generalization. One potential remedy is incorporating the pre-trained knowledge within the vision foundation models (higher-ranked) to expand the feature space, alleviating the model's overfitting to fake. To this end, we employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the original feature space into two orthogonal subspaces. By freezing the principal components and adapting only the remained components, we preserve the pre-trained knowledge while learning forgery-related patterns. Compared to existing full-parameters and LoRA-based tuning methods, we explicitly ensure orthogonality enabling the higher rank of the whole feature space, effectively minimizing overfitting and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments with our deep analysis on both deepfake and synthetic image detection benchmarks demonstrate superior generalization performance in detection.</description>

      <title>Low-Contrast-Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Endoscopic Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The segmentation of endoscopic images plays a vital role in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. The advancements in deep learning have led to the employment of numerous models for endoscopic tumor segmentation, achieving promising segmentation performance. Despite recent advancements, precise segmentation remains challenging due to limited annotations and the issue of low contrast. To address these issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework termed LoCo via low-contrast-enhanced contrastive learning (LCC). This innovative approach effectively harnesses the vast amounts of unlabeled data available for endoscopic image segmentation, improving both accuracy and robustness in the segmentation process. Specifically, LCC incorporates two advanced strategies to enhance the distinctiveness of low-contrast pixels: inter-class contrast enhancement (ICE) and boundary contrast enhancement (BCE), enabling models to segment low-contrast pixels among malignant tumors, benign tumors, and normal tissues. Additionally, a confidence-based dynamic filter (CDF) is designed for pseudo-label selection, enhancing the utilization of generated pseudo-labels for unlabeled data with a specific focus on minority classes. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets, as well as a large proprietary dataset collected over three years, demonstrate that LoCo achieves state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming previous methods. The source code of LoCo is available at the URL of \href{https://github.com/AnoK3111/LoCo}{https://github.com/AnoK3111/LoCo}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photography during night or in dark conditions typically suffers from noise, low light and blurring issues due to the dim environment and the common use of long exposure. Although Deblurring and Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) are related under these conditions, most approaches in image restoration solve these tasks separately. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods. Our model, DarkIR, achieves new state-of-the-art results on the popular LOLBlur, LOLv2 and Real-LOLBlur datasets, being able to generalize on real-world night and dark images.

      <title>Are They the Same? Exploring Visual Correspondence Shortcomings of Multimodal LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal models have shown a strong ability in visual perception, reasoning abilities, and vision-language understanding. However, studies on visual matching ability are missing, where finding the visual correspondence of objects is essential in vision research. Our research reveals that the matching capabilities in recent multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still exhibit systematic shortcomings, even with current strong MLLMs models, GPT-4o. In particular, we construct a Multimodal Visual Matching (MMVM) benchmark to fairly benchmark over 30 different MLLMs. The MMVM benchmark is built from 15 open-source datasets and Internet videos with manual annotation. We categorize the data samples of MMVM benchmark into eight aspects based on the required cues and capabilities to more comprehensively evaluate and analyze current MLLMs. In addition, we have designed an automatic annotation pipeline to generate the MMVM SFT dataset, including 220K visual matching data with reasoning annotation. Finally, we present CoLVA, a novel contrastive MLLM with two novel technical designs: fine-grained vision expert with object-level contrastive learning and instruction augmentation strategy. CoLVA achieves 51.06\% overall accuracy (OA) on the MMVM benchmark, surpassing GPT-4o and baseline by 8.41\% and 23.58\% OA, respectively. The results show the effectiveness of our MMVM SFT dataset and our novel technical designs. Code, benchmark, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/zhouyiks/CoLVA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for generating fly-through videos of a scene, from a single image and a given camera trajectory. We build upon an image-to-video latent diffusion model. We condition its UNet denoiser on the camera trajectory, using four techniques. (1) We condition the UNet's temporal blocks on raw camera extrinsics, similar to MotionCtrl. (2) We use images containing camera rays and directions, similar to CameraCtrl. (3) We reproject the initial image to subsequent frames and use the resulting video as a condition. (4) We use 2D&lt;=&gt;3D transformers to introduce a global 3D representation, which implicitly conditions on the camera poses. We combine all conditions in a ContolNet-style architecture. We then propose a metric that evaluates overall video quality and the ability to preserve details with view changes, which we use to analyze the trade-offs of individual and combined conditions. Finally, we identify an optimal combination of conditions. We calibrate camera positions in our datasets for scale consistency across scenes, and we train our scene exploration model, CamCtrl3D, demonstrating state-of-theart results.</description>

      <title>VDOR: A Video-based Dataset for Object Removal via Sequence Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object removal, as a sub-task of image inpainting, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Existing datasets related to object removal serve a valuable foundation for model validation and optimization. However, they mainly rely on inpainting techniques to generate pseudo-removed results, leading to distribution gaps between synthetic and real-world data. While some real-world datasets mitigate these issues, they face challenges such as limited scalability, high annotation costs, and unrealistic representations of lighting and shadows. To address these limitations, we propose a novel video-based annotation pipeline for constructing a realistic illumination-aware object removal dataset. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce VDOR, a dataset specifically designed for object removal tasks, which comprises triplets of original frame images with objects, background images without objects, and corresponding masks. By leveraging continuous real-world video frames, we minimize distribution gaps and accurately capture realistic lighting and shadow variations, ensuring close alignment with real-world scenarios. Our approach significantly reduces annotation effort while providing a robust foundation for advancing object removal research.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Subjective and Objective Evaluation Method for Text-generated Video</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) technology advancements, as demonstrated by models such as Gen3, Pika, and Sora, have significantly broadened its applicability and popularity. This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of text-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-generated videos remains challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed a large-scale benchmark dataset for \textbf{T}ext-generated \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{eval}uation, \textbf{T2VEval-Bench}, comprising 148 textual words and 1,783 videos generated by 12 models. During the subjective evaluation, we collected five key scores: overall impression, video quality, aesthetic quality, realness, and text-video consistency. For objective evaluation, we developed the \textbf{T2VEval} model, which assesses videos across three branches: quality, authenticity, and consistency. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large oracle model. Additionally, we implemented a progressive training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. The dataset and code will be open-sourced upon completion of the follow-up work.</description>

      <title>FaceQSORT: a Multi-Face Tracking Method based on Biometric and Appearance Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tracking multiple faces is a difficult problem, as there may be partially occluded or lateral faces. In multiple face tracking, association is typically based on (biometric) face features. However, the models used to extract these face features usually require frontal face images, which can limit the tracking performance. In this work, a multi-face tracking method inspired by StrongSort, FaceQSORT, is proposed. To mitigate the problem of partially occluded or lateral faces, biometric face features are combined with visual appearance features (i.e., generated by a generic object classifier), with both features are extracted from the same face patch. A comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed, including a comparison of different face descriptors, an evaluation of different parameter settings, and the application of a different similarity metric. All experiments are conducted with a new multi-face tracking dataset and a subset of the ChokePoint dataset. The `Paris Lodron University Salzburg Faces in a Queue' dataset consists of a total of seven fully annotated sequences (12730 frames) and is made publicly available as part of this work. Together with this dataset, annotations of 6 sequences from the ChokePoint dataset are also provided.</description>

      <title>Dfilled: Repurposing Edge-Enhancing Diffusion for Guided DSM Void Filling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital Surface Models (DSMs) are essential for accurately representing Earth's topography in geospatial analyses. DSMs capture detailed elevations of natural and manmade features, crucial for applications like urban planning, vegetation studies, and 3D reconstruction. However, DSMs derived from stereo satellite imagery often contain voids or missing data due to occlusions, shadows, and lowsignal areas. Previous studies have primarily focused on void filling for digital elevation models (DEMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), employing methods such as inverse distance weighting (IDW), kriging, and spline interpolation. While effective for simpler terrains, these approaches often fail to handle the intricate structures present in DSMs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dfilled, a guided DSM void filling method that leverages optical remote sensing images through edge-enhancing diffusion. Dfilled repurposes deep anisotropic diffusion models, which originally designed for super-resolution tasks, to inpaint DSMs. Additionally, we utilize Perlin noise to create inpainting masks that mimic natural void patterns in DSMs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Dfilled surpasses traditional interpolation methods and deep learning approaches in DSM void filling tasks. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the method's ability to manage complex features and deliver accurate, visually coherent results.</description>

Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake technology poses significant challenges to the authenticity and trustworthiness of digital media, necessitating the development of robust detection methods. This study explores the application of Swin Transformers, a state-of-the-art architecture leveraging shifted windows for self-attention, in detecting and classifying deepfake images. Using the Real and Fake Face Detection dataset by Yonsei University's Computational Intelligence Photography Lab, we evaluate the Swin Transformer and hybrid models such as Swin-ResNet and Swin-KNN, focusing on their ability to identify subtle manipulation artifacts. Our results demonstrate that the Swin Transformer outperforms conventional CNN-based architectures, including VGG16, ResNet18, and AlexNet, achieving a test accuracy of 71.29%. Additionally, we present insights into hybrid model design, highlighting the complementary strengths of transformer and CNN-based approaches in deepfake detection. This study underscores the potential of transformer-based architectures for improving accuracy and generalizability in image-based manipulation detection, paving the way for more effective countermeasures against deepfake threats.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel Deep Learning-based and lightweight approach for the automated detection of sports highlights (HLs) from audio and video sources. HL detection is a key task in sports video analysis, traditionally requiring significant human effort. Our solution leverages Deep Learning (DL) models trained on relatively small datasets of audio Mel-spectrograms and grayscale video frames, achieving promising accuracy rates of 89% and 83% for audio and video detection, respectively. The use of small datasets, combined with simple architectures, demonstrates the practicality of our method for fast and cost-effective deployment. Furthermore, an ensemble model combining both modalities shows improved robustness against false positives and false negatives. The proposed methodology offers a scalable solution for automated HL detection across various types of sports video content, reducing the need for manual intervention. Future work will focus on enhancing model architectures and extending this approach to broader scene-detection tasks in media analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into the study of 3D point cloud reconstruction from a single image. Our objective is to develop the Consistency Diffusion Model, exploring synergistic 2D and 3D priors in the Bayesian framework to ensure superior consistency in the reconstruction process, a challenging yet critical requirement in this field. Specifically, we introduce a pioneering training framework under diffusion models that brings two key innovations. First, we convert 3D structural priors derived from the initial 3D point cloud as a bound term to increase evidence in the variational Bayesian framework, leveraging these robust intrinsic priors to tightly govern the diffusion training process and bolster consistency in reconstruction. Second, we extract and incorporate 2D priors from the single input image, projecting them onto the 3D point cloud to enrich the guidance for diffusion training. Our framework not only sidesteps potential model learning shifts that may arise from directly imposing additional constraints during training but also precisely transposes the 2D priors into the 3D domain. Extensive experimental evaluations reveal that our approach sets new benchmarks in both synthetic and real-world datasets. The code is included with the submission.</description>

      <title>IC-Portrait: In-Context Matching for View-Consistent Personalized Portrait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing diffusion models show great potential for identity-preserving generation. However, personalized portrait generation remains challenging due to the diversity in user profiles, including variations in appearance and lighting conditions. To address these challenges, we propose IC-Portrait, a novel framework designed to accurately encode individual identities for personalized portrait generation. Our key insight is that pre-trained diffusion models are fast learners (e.g.,100 ~ 200 steps) for in-context dense correspondence matching, which motivates the two major designs of our IC-Portrait framework. Specifically, we reformulate portrait generation into two sub-tasks: 1) Lighting-Aware Stitching: we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 80%, yields a highly effective self-supervisory representation learning of reference image lighting. 2) View-Consistent Adaptation: we leverage a synthetic view-consistent profile dataset to learn the in-context correspondence. The reference profile can then be warped into arbitrary poses for strong spatial-aligned view conditioning. Coupling these two designs by simply concatenating latents to form ControlNet-like supervision and modeling, enables us to significantly enhance the identity preservation fidelity and stability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that IC-Portrait consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, with particularly notable improvements in visual qualities. Furthermore, IC-Portrait even demonstrates 3D-aware relighting capabilities.</description>

      <title>VoD-3DGS: View-opacity-Dependent 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing a 3D scene from images is challenging due to the different ways light interacts with surfaces depending on the viewer's position and the surface's material. In classical computer graphics, materials can be classified as diffuse or specular, interacting with light differently. The standard 3D Gaussian Splatting model struggles to represent view-dependent content, since it cannot differentiate an object within the scene from the light interacting with its specular surfaces, which produce highlights or reflections. In this paper, we propose to extend the 3D Gaussian Splatting model by introducing an additional symmetric matrix to enhance the opacity representation of each 3D Gaussian. This improvement allows certain Gaussians to be suppressed based on the viewer's perspective, resulting in a more accurate representation of view-dependent reflections and specular highlights without compromising the scene's integrity. By allowing the opacity to be view dependent, our enhanced model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-Nerf, Tanks&amp;Temples, Deep Blending, and Nerf-Synthetic datasets without a significant loss in rendering speed, achieving &gt;60FPS, and only incurring a minimal increase in memory used.</description>

      <title>Anatomy Might Be All You Need: Forecasting What to Do During Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surgical guidance can be delivered in various ways. In neurosurgery, spatial guidance and orientation are predominantly achieved through neuronavigation systems that reference pre-operative MRI scans. Recently, there has been growing interest in providing live guidance by analyzing video feeds from tools such as endoscopes. Existing approaches, including anatomy detection, orientation feedback, phase recognition, and visual question-answering, primarily focus on aiding surgeons in assessing the current surgical scene. This work aims to provide guidance on a finer scale, aiming to provide guidance by forecasting the trajectory of the surgical instrument, essentially addressing the question of what to do next. To address this task, we propose a model that not only leverages the historical locations of surgical instruments but also integrates anatomical features. Importantly, our work does not rely on explicit ground truth labels for instrument trajectories. Instead, the ground truth is generated by a detection model trained to detect both anatomical structures and instruments within surgical videos of a comprehensive dataset containing pituitary surgery videos. By analyzing the interaction between anatomy and instrument movements in these videos and forecasting future instrument movements, we show that anatomical features are a valuable asset in addressing this challenging task. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to address this task for manually operated surgeries.</description>

      <title>MatIR: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Image Restoration Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Transformers-based models have made significant progress in the field of image restoration by leveraging their inherent ability to capture complex contextual features. Recently, Mamba models have made a splash in the field of computer vision due to their ability to handle long-range dependencies and their significant computational efficiency compared to Transformers. However, Mamba currently lags behind Transformers in contextual learning capabilities. To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data. In the Transformer module, we combine triangular window-based local attention with channel-based global attention to effectively activate the attention mechanism over a wider range of image pixels. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Idempotence and Perceptual Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Idempotence is the stability of image codec to re-compression. At the first glance, it is unrelated to perceptual image compression. However, we find that theoretically: 1) Conditional generative model-based perceptual codec satisfies idempotence; 2) Unconditional generative model with idempotence constraint is equivalent to conditional generative codec. Based on this newfound equivalence, we propose a new paradigm of perceptual image codec by inverting unconditional generative model with idempotence constraints. Our codec is theoretically equivalent to conditional generative codec, and it does not require training new models. Instead, it only requires a pre-trained mean-square-error codec and unconditional generative model. Empirically, we show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as HiFiC and ILLM, in terms of Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID).

      <title>Rate-Adaptive Quantization: A Multi-Rate Codebook Adaptation for Vector Quantization-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning discrete representations with vector quantization (VQ) has emerged as a powerful approach in various generative models. However, most VQ-based models rely on a single, fixed-rate codebook, requiring extensive retraining for new bitrates or efficiency requirements. We introduce Rate-Adaptive Quantization (RAQ), a multi-rate codebook adaptation framework for VQ-based generative models. RAQ applies a data-driven approach to generate variable-rate codebooks from a single baseline VQ model, enabling flexible tradeoffs between compression and reconstruction fidelity. Additionally, we provide a simple clustering-based procedure for pre-trained VQ models, offering an alternative when retraining is infeasible. Our experiments show that RAQ performs effectively across multiple rates, often outperforming conventional fixed-rate VQ baselines. By enabling a single system to seamlessly handle diverse bitrate requirements, RAQ extends the adaptability of VQ-based generative models and broadens their applicability to data compression, reconstruction, and generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalisable Time Series Understanding Across Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing and computer vision, driven by efficient pre-training on large datasets, have enabled foundation models to excel on a wide range of tasks. However, this potential has not yet been fully realised in time series analysis, as existing methods fail to address the heterogeneity in large time series corpora. Prevalent in domains ranging from medicine to finance, time series vary substantially in characteristics such as variate count, inter-variate relationships, temporal patterns, and sampling frequency. To address this, we introduce a novel pre-training paradigm specifically designed to handle time series heterogeneity. We propose a tokeniser with learnable domain signatures, a dual masking strategy, and a normalised cross-correlation loss, enabling our open model for general time series analysis (OTiS) to efficiently learn from large time series corpora. Extensive benchmarking on diverse tasks, such as classification, regression, and forecasting, demonstrates that OTiS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/oetu/otis.</description>

      <title>Cautious Optimizers: Improving Training with One Line of Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AdamW has been the default optimizer for transformer pretraining. For many years, our community searched for faster and more stable optimizers with only constrained positive outcomes. In this work, we propose a single-line modification in Pytorch to any momentum-based optimizer, which we rename cautious optimizer, e.g. C-AdamW and C-Lion. Our theoretical result shows that this modification preserves Adam's Hamiltonian function and it does not break the convergence guarantee under the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a whole new family of optimizers is revealed by our theoretical insight. Among them, we pick the simplest one for empirical experiments, showing not only speed-up on Llama and MAE pretraining up to $1.47$ times, but also better results in LLM post-training tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/kyleliang919/C-Optim.</description>

      <title>Task-based Regularization in Penalized Least-Squares for Binary Signal Detection Tasks in Medical Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image denoising algorithms have been extensively investigated for medical imaging. To perform image denoising, penalized least-squares (PLS) problems can be designed and solved, in which the penalty term encodes prior knowledge of the object being imaged. Sparsity-promoting penalties, such as total variation (TV), have been a popular choice for regularizing image denoising problems. However, such hand-crafted penalties may not be able to preserve task-relevant information in measured image data and can lead to oversmoothed image appearances and patchy artifacts that degrade signal detectability. Supervised learning methods that employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a popular approach to denoising medical images. However, studies have shown that CNNs trained with loss functions based on traditional image quality measures can lead to a loss of task-relevant information in images. Some previous works have investigated task-based loss functions that employ model observers for training the CNN denoising models. However, such training processes typically require a large number of noisy and ground-truth (noise-free or low-noise) image data pairs. In this work, we propose a task-based regularization strategy for use with PLS in medical image denoising. The proposed task-based regularization is associated with the likelihood of linear test statistics of noisy images for Gaussian noise models. The proposed method does not require ground-truth image data and solves an individual optimization problem for denoising each image. Computer-simulation studies are conducted that consider a multivariate-normally distributed (MVN) lumpy background and a binary texture background. It is demonstrated that the proposed regularization strategy can effectively improve signal detectability in denoised images.</description>
