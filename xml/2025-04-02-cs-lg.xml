      <title>From Occurrence to Consequence: A Comprehensive Data-driven Analysis of Building Fire Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building fires pose a persistent threat to life, property, and infrastructure, emphasizing the need for advanced risk mitigation strategies. This study presents a data-driven framework analyzing U.S. fire risks by integrating over one million fire incident reports with diverse fire-relevant datasets, including social determinants, building inventories, weather conditions, and incident-specific factors. By adapting machine learning models, we identify key risk factors influencing fire occurrence and consequences. Our findings show that vulnerable communities, characterized by socioeconomic disparities or the prevalence of outdated or vacant buildings, face higher fire risks. Incident-specific factors, such as fire origins and safety features, strongly influence fire consequences. Buildings equipped with fire detectors and automatic extinguishing systems experience significantly lower fire spread and injury risks. By pinpointing high-risk areas and populations, this research supports targeted interventions, including mandating fire safety systems and providing subsidies for disadvantaged communities. These measures can enhance fire prevention, protect vulnerable groups, and promote safer, more equitable communities.</description>

      <title>Validating Emergency Department Admission Predictions Based on Local Data Through MIMIC-IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective management of Emergency Department (ED) overcrowding is essential for improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resource allocation. This study validates hospital admission prediction models initially developed using a small local dataset from a Greek hospital by leveraging the comprehensive MIMIC-IV dataset. After preprocessing the MIMIC-IV data, five algorithms were evaluated: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART), and Support Vector Machines (SVM Radial). Among these, RF demonstrated superior performance, achieving an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.9999, sensitivity of 0.9997, and specificity of 0.9999 when applied to the MIMIC-IV data. These findings highlight the robustness of RF in handling complex datasets for admission prediction, establish MIMIC-IV as a valuable benchmark for validating models based on smaller local datasets, and provide actionable insights for improving ED management strategies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis has emerged as a critical tool for understanding human emotions across diverse communication channels. While existing methods have made significant strides, they often struggle to effectively differentiate and integrate modality-shared and modality-specific information, limiting the performance of multimodal learning. To address this challenge, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (HAEMSA), a novel framework that synergistically combines evolutionary optimization, cross-modal knowledge transfer, and multi-task learning. HAEMSA employs a hierarchical structure of adaptive experts to capture both global and local modality representations, enabling more nuanced sentiment analysis. Our approach leverages evolutionary algorithms to dynamically optimize network architectures and modality combinations, adapting to both partial and full modality scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate HAEMSA's superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets. On CMU-MOSEI, HAEMSA achieves a 2.6% increase in 7-class accuracy and a 0.059 decrease in MAE compared to the previous best method. For CMU-MOSI, we observe a 6.3% improvement in 7-class accuracy and a 0.058 reduction in MAE. On IEMOCAP, HAEMSA outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.84% in weighted-F1 score for emotion recognition. These results underscore HAEMSA's effectiveness in capturing complex multimodal interactions and generalizing across different emotional contexts.</description>

      <title>Why Representation Engineering Works: A Theoretical and Empirical Study in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation Engineering (RepE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI transparency by focusing on high-level representations rather than individual neurons or circuits. It has proven effective in improving interpretability and control, showing that representations can emerge, propagate, and shape final model outputs in large language models (LLMs). However, in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), visual input can override factual linguistic knowledge, leading to hallucinated responses that contradict reality. To address this challenge, we make the first attempt to extend RepE to VLMs, analyzing how multimodal representations are preserved and transformed. Building on our findings and drawing inspiration from successful RepE applications, we develop a theoretical framework that explains the stability of neural activity across layers using the principal eigenvector, uncovering the underlying mechanism of RepE. We empirically validate these instrinsic properties, demonstrating their broad applicability and significance. By bridging theoretical insights with empirical validation, this work transforms RepE from a descriptive tool into a structured theoretical framework, opening new directions for improving AI robustness, fairness, and transparency.</description>

      <title>PowerGNN: A Topology-Aware Graph Neural Network for Electricity Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources introduces significant variability and uncertainty in modern power systems, making accurate state prediction critical for reliable grid operation. Conventional forecasting methods often neglect the power grid's inherent topology, limiting their ability to capture complex spatio temporal dependencies. This paper proposes a topology aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for predicting power system states under high renewable integration. We construct a graph based representation of the power network, modeling buses and transmission lines as nodes and edges, and introduce a specialized GNN architecture that integrates GraphSAGE convolutions with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model both spatial and temporal correlations in system dynamics. The model is trained and evaluated on the NREL 118 test system using realistic, time synchronous renewable generation profiles. Our results show that the proposed GNN outperforms baseline approaches including fully connected neural networks, linear regression, and rolling mean models, achieving substantial improvements in predictive accuracy. The GNN achieves average RMSEs of 0.13 to 0.17 across all predicted variables and demonstrates consistent performance across spatial locations and operational conditions. These results highlight the potential of topology aware learning for scalable and robust power system forecasting in future grids with high renewable penetration.</description>

      <title>PlatMetaX: An Integrated MATLAB platform for Meta-Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landscape of optimization problems has become increasingly complex, necessitating the development of advanced optimization techniques. Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO), which involves refining the optimization algorithms themselves via meta-learning, has emerged as a promising approach. Recognizing the limitations in existing platforms, we presents PlatMetaX, a novel MATLAB platform for MetaBBO with reinforcement learning. PlatMetaX integrates the strengths of MetaBox and PlatEMO, offering a comprehensive framework for developing, evaluating, and comparing optimization algorithms. The platform is designed to handle a wide range of optimization problems, from single-objective to multi-objective, and is equipped with a rich set of baseline algorithms and evaluation metrics. We demonstrate the utility of PlatMetaX through extensive experiments and provide insights into its design and implementation. PlatMetaX is available at: \href{https://github.com/Yxxx616/PlatMetaX}{https://github.com/Yxxx616/PlatMetaX}.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot LLMs in Human-in-the-Loop RL: Replacing Human Feedback for Reward Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning often faces challenges with reward misalignment, where agents optimize for given rewards but fail to exhibit the desired behaviors. This occurs when the reward function incentivizes proxy behaviors that diverge from the true objective. While human-in-the-loop (HIL) methods can help, they may exacerbate the problem, as humans are prone to biases that lead to inconsistent, subjective, or misaligned feedback, complicating the learning process. To address these issues, we propose two key contributions. First, we extend the use of zero-shot, off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) for reward shaping beyond natural language processing (NLP) to continuous control tasks. By leveraging LLMs as direct feedback providers, we replace surrogate models trained on human feedback, which often suffer from the bias inherent in the feedback data it is trained on. Second, we introduce a hybrid framework (LLM-HFBF) that enables LLMs to identify and correct biases in human feedback while incorporating this feedback into the reward shaping process. The LLM-HFBF framework creates a more balanced and reliable system by addressing both the limitations of LLMs (e.g., lack of domain-specific knowledge) and human supervision (e.g., inherent biases). By enabling human feedback bias flagging and correction, our approach improves reinforcement learning performance and reduces reliance on potentially biased human guidance. Empirical experiments show that biased human feedback significantly reduces performance, with average episodic reward (AER) dropping from 28.472 in (unbiased approaches) to 7.039 (biased with conservative bias). In contrast, LLM-based approaches maintain a matching AER like unbiased feedback, even in custom edge case scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Spatial-temporal Deep Probabilistic Diffusion Model for Reliable Hail Nowcasting with Radar Echo Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hail nowcasting is a considerable contributor to meteorological disasters and there is a great need to mitigate its socioeconomic effects through precise forecast that has high resolution, long lead times and local details with large landscapes. Existing medium-range weather forecasting methods primarily rely on changes in upper air currents and cloud layers to predict precipitation events, such as heavy rainfall, which are unsuitable for hail nowcasting since it is mainly caused by low-altitude local strong convection associated with terrains. Additionally, radar captures the status of low cloud layers, such as water vapor, droplets, and ice crystals, providing rich signals suitable for hail nowcasting. To this end, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal gEnerAtive Model called SteamCast for hail nowcasting with radar echo extrapolation, it is a deep probabilistic diffusion model based on spatial-temporal representations including radar echoes as well as their position/time embeddings, which we trained on historical reanalysis archive from Yan'an Meteorological Bureau in China, where the crop yield like apple suffers greatly from hail damage. Considering the short-term nature of hail, SteamCast provides 30-minute nowcasts at 6-minute intervals for a single radar reflectivity variable, across 9 different vertical angles, on a latitude-longitude grid with approximately 1 km * 1 km resolution per pixel in Yan'an City, China. By successfully fusing the spatial-temporal features of radar echoes, SteamCast delivers competitive, and in some cases superior, results compared to other deep learning-based models such as PredRNN and VMRNN.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Weighted Gradients for Model Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model calibration is essential for ensuring that the predictions of deep neural networks accurately reflect true probabilities in real-world classification tasks. However, deep networks often produce over-confident or under-confident predictions, leading to miscalibration. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue by designing effective loss functions for calibration, such as focal loss. In this paper, we analyze its effectiveness and provide a unified loss framework of focal loss and its variants, where we mainly attribute their superiority in model calibration to the loss weighting factor that estimates sample-wise uncertainty. Based on our analysis, existing loss functions fail to achieve optimal calibration performance due to two main issues: including misalignment during optimization and insufficient precision in uncertainty estimation. Specifically, focal loss cannot align sample uncertainty with gradient scaling and the single logit cannot indicate the uncertainty. To address these issues, we reformulate the optimization from the perspective of gradients, which focuses on uncertain samples. Meanwhile, we propose using the Brier Score as the loss weight factor, which provides a more accurate uncertainty estimation via all the logits. Extensive experiments on various models and datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Mixed Features for Imbalance Data Oversampling: Application to Bank Customers Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates rare event detection on tabular data within binary classification. Standard techniques to handle class imbalance include SMOTE, which generates synthetic samples from the minority class. However, SMOTE is intrinsically designed for continuous input variables. In fact, despite SMOTE-NC-its default extension to handle mixed features (continuous and categorical variables)-very few works propose procedures to synthesize mixed features. On the other hand, many real-world classification tasks, such as in banking sector, deal with mixed features, which have a significant impact on predictive performances. To this purpose, we introduce MGS-GRF, an oversampling strategy designed for mixed features. This method uses a kernel density estimator with locally estimated full-rank covariances to generate continuous features, while categorical ones are drawn from the original samples through a generalized random forest. Empirically, contrary to SMOTE-NC, we show that MGS-GRF exhibits two important properties: (i) the coherence i.e. the ability to only generate combinations of categorical features that are already present in the original dataset and (ii) association, i.e. the ability to preserve the dependence between continuous and categorical features. We also evaluate the predictive performances of LightGBM classifiers trained on data sets, augmented with synthetic samples from various strategies. Our comparison is performed on simulated and public real-world data sets, as well as on a private data set from a leading financial institution. We observe that synthetic procedures that have the properties of coherence and association display better predictive performances in terms of various predictive metrics (PR and ROC AUC...), with MGS-GRF being the best one. Furthermore, our method exhibits promising results for the private banking application, with development pipeline being compliant with regulatory constraints.</description>

      <title>MoRE-LLM: Mixture of Rule Experts Guided by a Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure the trustworthiness and interpretability of AI systems, it is essential to align machine learning models with human domain knowledge. This can be a challenging and time-consuming endeavor that requires close communication between data scientists and domain experts. Recent leaps in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can help alleviate this burden. In this paper, we propose a Mixture of Rule Experts guided by a Large Language Model (MoRE-LLM) which combines a data-driven black-box model with knowledge extracted from an LLM to enable domain knowledge-aligned and transparent predictions. While the introduced Mixture of Rule Experts (MoRE) steers the discovery of local rule-based surrogates during training and their utilization for the classification task, the LLM is responsible for enhancing the domain knowledge alignment of the rules by correcting and contextualizing them. Importantly, our method does not rely on access to the LLM during test time and ensures interpretability while not being prone to LLM-based confabulations. We evaluate our method on several tabular data sets and compare its performance with interpretable and non-interpretable baselines. Besides performance, we evaluate our grey-box method with respect to the utilization of interpretable rules. In addition to our quantitative evaluation, we shed light on how the LLM can provide additional context to strengthen the comprehensibility and trustworthiness of the model's reasoning process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent generative reasoning breakthroughs have transformed how large language models (LLMs) tackle complex problems by dynamically retrieving and refining information while generating coherent, multi-step thought processes. Techniques such as inference-time scaling, reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and distillation have been successfully applied to models like DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1 &amp; o3, GPT-4o, Qwen-32B, and various Llama variants, resulting in enhanced reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the top 27 LLM models released between 2023 and 2025 (including models such as Mistral AI Small 3 24B, DeepSeek-R1, Search-o1, QwQ-32B, and phi-4). Then, we present an extensive overview of training methodologies that spans general training approaches, mixture-of-experts (MoE) and architectural innovations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), chain-of-thought and self-improvement techniques, as well as test-time compute scaling, distillation, and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in advancing LLM capabilities, including improving multi-step reasoning without human supervision, overcoming limitations in chained tasks, balancing structured prompts with flexibility, and enhancing long-context retrieval and external tool integration.</description>

      <title>RBFleX-NAS: Training-Free Neural Architecture Search Using Radial Basis Function Kernel and Hyperparameter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an automated technique to design optimal neural network architectures for a specific workload. Conventionally, evaluating candidate networks in NAS involves extensive training, which requires significant time and computational resources. To address this, training-free NAS has been proposed to expedite network evaluation with minimal search time. However, state-of-the-art training-free NAS algorithms struggle to precisely distinguish well-performing networks from poorly-performing networks, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions and consequently sub-optimal top-1 network accuracy. Moreover, they are less effective in activation function exploration. To tackle the challenges, this paper proposes RBFleX-NAS, a novel training-free NAS framework that accounts for both activation outputs and input features of the last layer with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. We also present a detection algorithm to identify optimal hyperparameters using the obtained activation outputs and input feature maps. We verify the efficacy of RBFleX-NAS over a variety of NAS benchmarks. RBFleX-NAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art training-free NAS methods in terms of top-1 accuracy, achieving this with short search time in NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-SSS. In addition, it demonstrates higher Kendall correlation compared to layer-based training-free NAS algorithms. Furthermore, we propose NAFBee, a new activation design space that extends the activation type to encompass various commonly used functions. In this extended design space, RBFleX-NAS demonstrates its superiority by accurately identifying the best-performing network during activation function search, providing a significant advantage over other NAS algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Methodology to extract Geo-Referenced Standard Routes from AIS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maritime AIS (Automatic Identification Systems) data serve as a valuable resource for studying vessel behavior. This study proposes a methodology to analyze route between maritime points of interest and extract geo-referenced standard routes, as maritime patterns of life, from raw AIS data. The underlying assumption is that ships adhere to consistent patterns when travelling in certain maritime areas due to geographical, environmental, or economic factors. Deviations from these patterns may be attributed to weather conditions, seasonality, or illicit activities. This enables maritime surveillance authorities to analyze the navigational behavior between ports, providing insights on vessel route patterns, possibly categorized by vessel characteristics (type, flag, or size). Our methodological process begins by segmenting AIS data into distinct routes using a finite state machine (FSM), which describes routes as seg-ments connecting pairs of points of interest. The extracted segments are ag-gregated based on their departure and destination ports and then modelled using iterative density-based clustering to connect these ports. The cluster-ing parameters are assigned manually to sample and then extended to the en-tire dataset using linear regression. Overall, the approach proposed in this paper is unsupervised and does not require any ground truth to be trained. The approach has been tested on data on the on a six-year AIS dataset cover-ing the Arctic region and the Europe, Middle East, North Africa areas. The total size of our dataset is 1.15 Tbytes. The approach has proved effective in extracting standard routes, with less than 5% outliers, mostly due to routes with either their departure or their destination port not included in the test areas.</description>

      <title>Cyborg Data: Merging Human with AI Generated Training Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated scoring (AS) systems used in large-scale assessment have traditionally used small statistical models that require a large quantity of hand-scored data to make accurate predictions, which can be time-consuming and costly. Generative Large Language Models are trained on many tasks and have shown impressive abilities to generalize to new tasks with little to no data. While these models require substantially more computational power to make predictions, they still require some fine-tuning to meet operational standards. Evidence suggests that these models can exceed human-human levels of agreement even when fine-tuned on small amounts of data. With this in mind, we propose a model distillation pipeline in which a large generative model, a Teacher, teaches a much smaller model, a Student. The Teacher, trained on a small subset of the training data, is used to provide scores on the remaining training data, which is then used to train the Student. We call the resulting dataset "Cyborg Data", as it combines human and machine-scored responses. Our findings show that Student models trained on "Cyborg Data" show performance comparable to training on the entire dataset, while only requiring 10% of the original hand-scored data.</description>

      <title>ShieldAgent: Shielding Agents via Verifiable Safety Policy Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by foundation models have seen widespread adoption across various real-world applications. However, they remain highly vulnerable to malicious instructions and attacks, which can result in severe consequences such as privacy breaches and financial losses. More critically, existing guardrails for LLMs are not applicable due to the complex and dynamic nature of agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose ShieldAgent, the first guardrail agent designed to enforce explicit safety policy compliance for the action trajectory of other protected agents through logical reasoning. Specifically, ShieldAgent first constructs a safety policy model by extracting verifiable rules from policy documents and structuring them into a set of action-based probabilistic rule circuits. Given the action trajectory of the protected agent, ShieldAgent retrieves relevant rule circuits and generates a shielding plan, leveraging its comprehensive tool library and executable code for formal verification. In addition, given the lack of guardrail benchmarks for agents, we introduce ShieldAgent-Bench, a dataset with 3K safety-related pairs of agent instructions and action trajectories, collected via SOTA attacks across 6 web environments and 7 risk categories. Experiments show that ShieldAgent achieves SOTA on ShieldAgent-Bench and three existing benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by 11.3% on average with a high recall of 90.1%. Additionally, ShieldAgent reduces API queries by 64.7% and inference time by 58.2%, demonstrating its high precision and efficiency in safeguarding agents.</description>

      <title>CSPO: Cross-Market Synergistic Stock Price Movement Forecasting with Pseudo-volatility Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stock market, as a cornerstone of the financial markets, places forecasting stock price movements at the forefront of challenges in quantitative finance. Emerging learning-based approaches have made significant progress in capturing the intricate and ever-evolving data patterns of modern markets. With the rapid expansion of the stock market, it presents two characteristics, i.e., stock exogeneity and volatility heterogeneity, that heighten the complexity of price forecasting. Specifically, while stock exogeneity reflects the influence of external market factors on price movements, volatility heterogeneity showcases the varying difficulty in movement forecasting against price fluctuations. In this work, we introduce the framework of Cross-market Synergy with Pseudo-volatility Optimization (CSPO). Specifically, CSPO implements an effective deep neural architecture to leverage external futures knowledge. This enriches stock embeddings with cross-market insights and thus enhances the CSPO's predictive capability. Furthermore, CSPO incorporates pseudo-volatility to model stock-specific forecasting confidence, enabling a dynamic adaptation of its optimization process to improve accuracy and robustness. Our extensive experiments, encompassing industrial evaluation and public benchmarking, highlight CSPO's superior performance over existing methods and effectiveness of all proposed modules contained therein.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Integrated Layered Attention (AILA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Adaptive Integrated Layered Attention (AILA), a neural network architecture that combines dense skip connections with different mechanisms for adaptive feature reuse across network layers. We evaluate AILA on three challenging tasks: price forecasting for various commodities and indices (S&amp;P 500, Gold, US dollar Futures, Coffee, Wheat), image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset, and sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. In all cases, AILA matches strong deep learning baselines (LSTMs, Transformers, and ResNets), achieving it at a fraction of the training and inference time. Notably, we implement and test two versions of the model - AILA-Architecture 1, which uses simple linear layers as the connection mechanism between layers, and AILA-Architecture 2, which implements an attention mechanism to selectively focus on outputs from previous layers. Both architectures are applied in a single-task learning setting, with each model trained separately for individual tasks. Results confirm that AILA's adaptive inter-layer connections yield robust gains by flexibly reusing pertinent features at multiple network depths. The AILA approach thus presents an extension to existing architectures, improving long-range sequence modeling, image recognition with optimised computational speed, and SOTA classification performance in practice.</description>

      <title>Adaptive State-Space Mamba for Real-Time Sensor Data Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-space modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for sequence analysis in various tasks such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, and signal processing. In this work, we propose an \emph{Adaptive State-Space Mamba} (\textbf{ASSM}) framework for real-time sensor data anomaly detection. While state-space models have been previously employed for image processing applications (e.g., style transfer \cite{wang2024stylemamba}), our approach leverages the core idea of sequential hidden states to tackle a significantly different domain: detecting anomalies on streaming sensor data.
  In particular, we introduce an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically modulates the hidden state update based on contextual and learned statistical cues. This design ensures that our model remains computationally efficient and scalable, even under rapid data arrival rates. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic sensor datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection performance compared to existing baselines. Our approach is easily extensible to other time-series tasks that demand rapid and reliable detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Graph Self-Training with Expectation-Maximization Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel \emph{uncertainty-aware graph self-training} approach for semi-supervised node classification. Our method introduces an Expectation-Maximization (EM) regularization scheme to incorporate an uncertainty mechanism during pseudo-label generation and model retraining. Unlike conventional graph self-training pipelines that rely on fixed pseudo-labels, our approach iteratively refines label confidences with an EM-inspired uncertainty measure. This ensures that the predictive model focuses on reliable graph regions while gradually incorporating ambiguous nodes. Inspired by prior work on uncertainty-aware self-training techniques~\cite{wang2024uncertainty}, our framework is designed to handle noisy graph structures and feature spaces more effectively. Through extensive experiments on several benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines by a margin of up to 2.5\% in accuracy while maintaining lower variance in performance across multiple runs.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Uncertainty-Aware Self-Training with Stochastic Node Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-training has become a popular semi-supervised learning technique for leveraging unlabeled data. However, the over-confidence of pseudo-labels remains a key challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel \emph{graph-based uncertainty-aware self-training} (GUST) framework to combat over-confidence in node classification. Drawing inspiration from the uncertainty integration idea introduced by Wang \emph{et al.}~\cite{wang2024uncertainty}, our method largely diverges from previous self-training approaches by focusing on \emph{stochastic node labeling} grounded in the graph topology. Specifically, we deploy a Bayesian-inspired module to estimate node-level uncertainty, incorporate these estimates into the pseudo-label generation process via an expectation-maximization (EM)-like step, and iteratively update both node embeddings and adjacency-based transformations. Experimental results on several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that our GUST framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in settings where labeled data is extremely sparse.</description>

      <title>LeForecast: Enterprise Hybrid Forecast by Time Series Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand is spiking in industrial fields for multidisciplinary forecasting, where a broad spectrum of sectors needs planning and forecasts to streamline intelligent business management, such as demand forecasting, product planning, inventory optimization, etc. Specifically, these tasks expecting intelligent approaches to learn from sequentially collected historical data and then foresee most possible trend, i.e. time series forecasting. Challenge of it lies in interpreting complex business contexts and the efficiency and generalisation of modelling. With aspirations of pre-trained foundational models for such purpose, given their remarkable success of large foundation model across legions of tasks, we disseminate \leforecast{}, an enterprise intelligence platform tailored for time series tasks. It integrates advanced interpretations of time series data and multi-source information, and a three-pillar modelling engine combining a large foundation model (Le-TSFM), multimodal model and hybrid model to derive insights, predict or infer futures, and then drive optimisation across multiple sectors in enterprise operations. The framework is composed by a model pool, model profiling module, and two different fusion approaches regarding original model architectures. Experimental results verify the efficiency of our trail fusion concepts: router-based fusion network and coordination of large and small models, resulting in high costs for redundant development and maintenance of models. This work reviews deployment of LeForecast and its performance in three industrial use cases. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that LeForecast is a profound and practical platform for efficient and competitive performance. And we do hope that this work can enlighten the research and grounding of time series techniques in accelerating enterprise.</description>

      <title>Ignite Forecasting with SPARK: An Efficient Generative Framework for Refining LLMs in Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) forecasting is crucial for predicting future events using historical data. With the surge of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have begun exploring their integration into TKG forecasting and achieved some success. However, they still face limitations such as limited input length, inefficient output generation, and resource-intensive refinement, which undermine their performance and practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce SPARK, a Sequence-level Proxy-Adapting framework for Refining LLMs in TKG forecasting. Inspired by inference-time algorithms adopted in controlling generation, SPARK offers a cost-effective, plug-and-play solution through two key innovations: (1) Beam Sequence-Level Generation, which reframes TKG forecasting as a top-K sequence-level generation task, using beam search for efficiently generating next-entity distribution in a single forward pass. (2) TKG Adapter for Refinement, which employs traditional TKG models as trainable proxy adapters to leverage global graph information and refine LLM outputs, overcoming both the input length and the resource-intensive fine-tuning problems. Experiments across diverse datasets validate SPARK's forecasting performance, robust generalization capabilities, and high efficiency. We release source codes at https://github.com/yin-gz/SPARK.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Clipping for Privacy-Preserving Few-Shot Learning: Enhancing Generalization with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of data-driven machine-learning applications, privacy concerns and the scarcity of labeled data have become paramount challenges. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the domain of few-shot learning, where the ability to learn from limited labeled data is crucial. Privacy-preserving few-shot learning algorithms have emerged as a promising solution to address such pronounced challenges. However, it is well-known that privacy-preserving techniques often lead to a drop in utility due to the fundamental trade-off between data privacy and model performance. To enhance the utility of privacy-preserving few-shot learning methods, we introduce a novel approach called Meta-Clip. This technique is specifically designed for meta-learning algorithms, including Differentially Private (DP) model-agnostic meta-learning, DP-Reptile, and DP-MetaSGD algorithms, with the objective of balancing data privacy preservation with learning capacity maximization. By dynamically adjusting clipping thresholds during the training process, our Adaptive Clipping method provides fine-grained control over the disclosure of sensitive information, mitigating overfitting on small datasets and significantly improving the generalization performance of meta-learning models. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in minimizing utility degradation, showcasing a superior privacy-utility trade-off compared to existing privacy-preserving techniques. The adoption of Adaptive Clipping represents a substantial step forward in the field of privacy-preserving few-shot learning, empowering the development of secure and accurate models for real-world applications, especially in scenarios where there are limited data availability.</description>

      <title>Advancing Spatiotemporal Prediction using Artificial Intelligence: Extending the Framework of Geographically and Temporally Weighted Neural Network (GTWNN) for Differing Geographical and Temporal Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at improving predictive crime models by extending the mathematical framework of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) tailored to general spatiotemporal problems and appropriately applying them. Recent advancements in the geospatial-temporal modelling field have focused on the inclusion of geographical weighting in their deep learning models to account for nonspatial stationarity, which is often apparent in spatial data. We formulate a novel semi-analytical approach to solving Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR), and applying it to London crime data. The results produce high-accuracy predictive evaluation scores that affirm the validity of the assumptions and approximations in the approach. This paper presents mathematical advances to the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Neural Network (GTWNN) framework, which offers a novel contribution to the field. Insights from past literature are harmoniously employed with the assumptions and approximations to generate three mathematical extensions to GTWNN's framework. Combinations of these extensions produce five novel ANNs, applied to the London and Detroit datasets. The results suggest that one of the extensions is redundant and is generally surpassed by another extension, which we term the history-dependent module. The remaining extensions form three novel ANN designs that pose potential GTWNN improvements. We evaluated the efficacy of various models in both the London and Detroit crime datasets, highlighting the importance of accounting for specific geographic and temporal characteristics when selecting modelling strategies to improve model suitability. In general, the proposed methods provide the foundations for a more context-aware, accurate, and robust ANN approach in spatio-temporal modelling.</description>

      <title>From Individual to Group: Developing a Context-Aware Multi-Criteria Group Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group decision-making is becoming increasingly common in areas such as education, dining, travel, and finance, where collaborative choices must balance diverse individual preferences. While conventional recommender systems are effective in personalization, they fall short in group settings due to their inability to manage conflicting preferences, contextual factors, and multiple evaluation criteria. This study presents the development of a Context-Aware Multi-Criteria Group Recommender System (CA-MCGRS) designed to address these challenges by integrating contextual factors and multiple criteria to enhance recommendation accuracy. By leveraging a Multi-Head Attention mechanism, our model dynamically weighs the importance of different features. Experiments conducted on an educational dataset with varied ratings and contextual variables demonstrate that CA-MCGRS consistently outperforms other approaches across four scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating context and multi-criteria evaluations to improve group recommendations, offering valuable insights for developing more effective group recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Combating the Bullwhip Effect in Rival Online Food Delivery Platforms Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wastage of perishable items has led to significant health and economic crises, increasing business uncertainty and fluctuating customer demand. This issue is worsened by online food delivery services, where frequent and unpredictable orders create inefficiencies in supply chain management, contributing to the bullwhip effect. This effect results in stockouts, excess inventory, and inefficiencies. Accurate demand forecasting helps stabilize inventory, optimize supplier orders, and reduce waste. This paper presents a Third-Party Logistics (3PL) supply chain model involving restaurants, online food apps, and customers, along with a deep learning-based demand forecasting model using a two-phase Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
  Phase one, intra-day forecasting, captures short-term variations, while phase two, daily forecasting, predicts overall demand. A two-year dataset from January 2023 to January 2025 from Swiggy and Zomato is used, employing discrete event simulation and grid search for optimal LSTM hyperparameters. The proposed method is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared score, with R-squared as the primary accuracy measure. Phase one achieves an R-squared score of 0.69 for Zomato and 0.71 for Swiggy with a training time of 12 minutes, while phase two improves to 0.88 for Zomato and 0.90 for Swiggy with a training time of 8 minutes.
  To mitigate demand fluctuations, restaurant inventory is dynamically managed using the newsvendor model, adjusted based on forecasted demand. The proposed framework significantly reduces the bullwhip effect, improving forecasting accuracy and supply chain efficiency. For phase one, supply chain instability decreases from 2.61 to 0.96, and for phase two, from 2.19 to 0.80. This demonstrates the model's effectiveness in minimizing food waste and maintaining optimal restaurant inventory levels.</description>

      <title>Model Lake: a New Alternative for Machine Learning Models Management and Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of artificial intelligence and data science across industries underscores the pressing need for effective management and governance of machine learning (ML) models. Traditional approaches to ML models management often involve disparate storage systems and lack standardized methodologies for versioning, audit, and re-use. Inspired by data lake concepts, this paper develops the concept of ML Model Lake as a centralized management framework for datasets, codes, and models within organizations environments. We provide an in-depth exploration of the Model Lake concept, delineating its architectural foundations, key components, operational benefits, and practical challenges. We discuss the transformative potential of adopting a Model Lake approach, such as enhanced model lifecycle management, discovery, audit, and reusability. Furthermore, we illustrate a real-world application of Model Lake and its transformative impact on data, code and model management practices.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Local and Global Fairness in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emerging application of Federated Learning (FL) in finance, hiring and healthcare, FL models are regulated to be fair, preventing disparities with respect to legally protected attributes such as race or gender. Two concepts of fairness are important in FL: global and local fairness. Global fairness addresses the disparity across the entire population and local fairness is concerned with the disparity within each client. Prior fair FL frameworks have improved either global or local fairness without considering both. Furthermore, while the majority of studies on fair FL focuses on binary settings, many real-world applications are multi-class problems. This paper proposes a framework that investigates the minimum accuracy lost for enforcing a specified level of global and local fairness in multi-class FL settings. Our framework leads to a simple post-processing algorithm that derives fair outcome predictors from the Bayesian optimal score functions. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the current state of the art (SOTA) with regard to the accuracy-fairness tradoffs, computational and communication costs. Codes are available at: https://github.com/papersubmission678/The-cost-of-local-and-global-fairness-in-FL .</description>

      <title>GroundHog: Revolutionizing GLDAS Groundwater Storage Downscaling for Enhanced Recharge Estimation in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term groundwater level (GWL) measurement is vital for effective policymaking and recharge estimation using annual maxima and minima. However, current methods prioritize short-term predictions and lack multi-year applicability, limiting their utility. Moreover, sparse in-situ measurements lead to reliance on low-resolution satellite data like GLDAS as the ground truth for Machine Learning models, further constraining accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we first develop an ML model to mitigate data gaps, achieving $R^2$ scores of 0.855 and 0.963 for maximum and minimum GWL predictions, respectively. Subsequently, using these predictions and well observations as ground truth, we train an Upsampling Model that uses low-resolution (25 km) GLDAS data as input to produce high-resolution (2 km) GWLs, achieving an excellent $R^2$ score of 0.96. Our approach successfully upscales GLDAS data for 2003-2024, allowing high-resolution recharge estimations and revealing critical trends for proactive resource management. Our method allows upsampling of groundwater storage (GWS) from GLDAS to high-resolution GWLs for any points independently of officially curated piezometer data, making it a valuable tool for decision-making.</description>

      <title>Invariant Control Strategies for Active Flow Control using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gained traction for active flow control tasks, with initial applications exploring drag mitigation via flow field augmentation around a two-dimensional cylinder. RL has since been extended to more complex turbulent flows and has shown significant potential in learning complex control strategies. However, such applications remain computationally challenging due to its sample inefficiency and associated simulation costs. This fact is worsened by the lack of generalization capabilities of these trained policy networks, often being implicitly tied to the input configurations of their training conditions. In this work, we propose the use of graph neural networks to address this particular limitation, effectively increasing the range of applicability and getting more value out of the upfront RL training cost. GNNs can naturally process unstructured, threedimensional flow data, preserving spatial relationships without the constraints of a Cartesian grid. Additionally, they incorporate rotational, reflectional, and permutation invariance into the learned control policies, thus improving generalization and thereby removing the shortcomings of commonly used CNN or MLP architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we revisit the well-established two-dimensional cylinder benchmark problem for active flow control. The RL training is implemented using Relexi, a high-performance RL framework, with flow simulations conducted in parallel using the high-order discontinuous Galerkin framework FLEXI. Our results show that GNN-based control policies achieve comparable performance to existing methods while benefiting from improved generalization properties. This work establishes GNNs as a promising architecture for RL-based flow control and highlights the capabilities of Relexi and FLEXI for large-scale RL applications in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven worker activity recognition and picking efficiency estimation in manual strawberry harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual fruit harvesting is common in agriculture, but the amount of time that pickers spend on nonproductive activities can make it very inefficient. Accurately identifying picking vs. non-picking activity is crucial for estimating picker efficiency and optimizing labor management and the harvest process. In this study, a practical system was developed to calculate the efficiency of pickers in commercial strawberry harvesting. Instrumented picking carts were used to record in real-time the harvested fruit weight, geo-location, and cart movement. A fleet of these carts was deployed during the commercial strawberry harvest season in Santa Maria, CA. The collected data was then used to train a CNN-LSTM-based deep neural network to classify a picker's activity into ``Pick" and ``NoPick" classes. Experimental evaluations showed that the CNN-LSTM model showed promising activity recognition performance with an F1 score accuracy of up to 0.974. The classification results were then used to compute two worker efficiency metrics: the percentage of time spent actively picking, and the time required to fill a tray. Analysis of the season-long harvest data showed that the pickers spent an average of 73.56% of their total harvest time actively picking strawberries, with an average tray fill time of 6.22 minutes. The mean accuracies of these metrics were 96.29% and 95.42%, respectively. When integrated on a commercial scale, the proposed technology could aid growers in automated worker activity monitoring and harvest optimization, ultimately helping to reduce non-productive time and enhance overall harvest efficiency.</description>

      <title>Harnessing uncertainty when learning through Equilibrium Propagation in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a supervised learning algorithm that trains network parameters using local neuronal activity. This is in stark contrast to backpropagation, where updating the parameters of the network requires significant data shuffling. Avoiding data movement makes EP particularly compelling as a learning framework for energy-efficient training on neuromorphic systems. In this work, we assess the ability of EP to learn on hardware that contain physical uncertainties. This is particularly important for researchers concerned with hardware implementations of self-learning systems that utilize EP. Our results demonstrate that deep, multi-layer neural network architectures can be trained successfully using EP in the presence of finite uncertainties, up to a critical limit. This limit is independent of the training dataset, and can be scaled through sampling the network according to the central limit theorem. Additionally, we demonstrate improved model convergence and performance for finite levels of uncertainty on the MNIST, KMNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Optimal performance is found for networks trained with uncertainties close to the critical limit. Our research supports future work to build self-learning hardware in situ with EP.</description>

      <title>Quamba2: A Robust and Scalable Post-training Quantization Framework for Selective State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) are emerging as a compelling alternative to Transformers because of their consistent memory usage and high performance. Despite this, scaling up SSMs on cloud services or limited-resource devices is challenging due to their storage requirements and computational power. To overcome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model size and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to quantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a particular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance. However, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different scenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for enhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To this end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both Mamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment on various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation persistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a linear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined with a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$. To ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline according to the clustering sequence. The experiments show that Quamba2-8B outperforms several state-of-the-art SSM quantization methods and delivers 1.3$\times$ and 3$\times$ speed-ups in the pre-filling and generation stages, respectively, while offering 4$\times$ memory reduction with only a $1.6\%$ average accuracy drop. The evaluation on MMLU shows the generalizability and robustness of our framework. The code and quantized models will be released at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Quamba.</description>

      <title>Task Tokens: A Flexible Approach to Adapting Behavior Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in imitation learning have led to transformer-based behavior foundation models (BFMs) that enable multi-modal, human-like control for humanoid agents. While excelling at zero-shot generation of robust behaviors, BFMs often require meticulous prompt engineering for specific tasks, potentially yielding suboptimal results. We introduce "Task Tokens", a method to effectively tailor BFMs to specific tasks while preserving their flexibility. Our approach leverages the transformer architecture of BFMs to learn a new task-specific encoder through reinforcement learning, keeping the original BFM frozen. This allows incorporation of user-defined priors, balancing reward design and prompt engineering. By training a task encoder to map observations to tokens, used as additional BFM inputs, we guide performance improvement while maintaining the model's diverse control characteristics. We demonstrate Task Tokens' efficacy across various tasks, including out-of-distribution scenarios, and show their compatibility with other prompting modalities. Our results suggest that Task Tokens offer a promising approach for adapting BFMs to specific control tasks while retaining their generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Learning Library Cell Representations in Vector Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Lib2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework to efficiently learn meaningful vector representations of library cells, enabling ML models to capture essential cell semantics. The framework comprises three key components: (1) an automated method for generating regularity tests to quantitatively evaluate how well cell representations reflect inter-cell relationships; (2) a self-supervised learning scheme that systematically extracts training data from Liberty files, removing the need for costly labeling; and (3) an attention-based model architecture that accommodates various pin counts and enables the creation of property-specific cell and arc embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate that Lib2Vec effectively captures functional and electrical similarities. Moreover, linear algebraic operations on cell vectors reveal meaningful relationships, such as vector(BUF) - vector(INV) + vector(NAND) ~ vector(AND), showcasing the framework's nuanced representation capabilities. Lib2Vec also enhances downstream circuit learning applications, especially when labeled data is scarce.</description>

      <title>FairSAM: Fair Classification on Corrupted Data Through Sharpness-Aware Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image classification models trained on clean data often suffer from significant performance degradation when exposed to testing corrupted data, such as images with impulse noise, Gaussian noise, or environmental noise. This degradation not only impacts overall performance but also disproportionately affects various demographic subgroups, raising critical algorithmic bias concerns. Although robust learning algorithms like Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) have shown promise in improving overall model robustness and generalization, they fall short in addressing the biased performance degradation across demographic subgroups. Existing fairness-aware machine learning methods - such as fairness constraints and reweighing strategies - aim to reduce performance disparities but hardly maintain robust and equitable accuracy across demographic subgroups when faced with data corruption. This reveals an inherent tension between robustness and fairness when dealing with corrupted data. To address these challenges, we introduce one novel metric specifically designed to assess performance degradation across subgroups under data corruption. Additionally, we propose \textbf{FairSAM}, a new framework that integrates \underline{Fair}ness-oriented strategies into \underline{SAM} to deliver equalized performance across demographic groups under corrupted conditions. Our experiments on multiple real-world datasets and various predictive tasks show that FairSAM successfully reconciles robustness and fairness, offering a structured solution for equitable and resilient image classification in the presence of data corruption.</description>

      <title>Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Multi-Cancer Classification and Biomarker Identification, An Interpretable Multi-Omics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of multi-omics data presents a major challenge in precision medicine, requiring advanced computational methods for accurate disease classification and biological interpretation. This study introduces the Multi-Omics Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (MOGKAN), a deep learning model that integrates messenger RNA, micro RNA sequences, and DNA methylation data with Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks for accurate and interpretable cancer classification across 31 cancer types. MOGKAN employs a hybrid approach combining differential expression with DESeq2, Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to reduce multi-omics data dimensionality while preserving relevant biological features. The model architecture is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem principle, using trainable univariate functions to enhance interpretability and feature analysis. MOGKAN achieves classification accuracy of 96.28 percent and demonstrates low experimental variability with a standard deviation that is reduced by 1.58 to 7.30 percents compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The biomarkers identified by MOGKAN have been validated as cancer-related markers through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. The proposed model presents an ability to uncover molecular oncogenesis mechanisms by detecting phosphoinositide-binding substances and regulating sphingolipid cellular processes. By integrating multi-omics data with graph-based deep learning, our proposed approach demonstrates superior predictive performance and interpretability that has the potential to enhance the translation of complex multi-omics data into clinically actionable cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>MNT-TNN: Spatiotemporal Traffic Data Imputation via Compact Multimode Nonlinear Transform-based Tensor Nuclear Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imputation of random or non-random missing data is a long-standing research topic and a crucial application for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, with the advent of modern communication technologies such as Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS), traffic data collection has outpaced traditional methods, introducing new challenges in random missing value imputation and increasing demands for spatiotemporal dependency modelings. To address these issues, we propose a novel spatiotemporal traffic imputation method, Multimode Nonlinear Transformed Tensor Nuclear Norm (MNT-TNN), grounded in the Transform-based Tensor Nuclear Norm (TTNN) optimization framework which exhibits efficient mathematical representations and theoretical guarantees for the recovery of random missing values. Specifically, we strictly extend the single-mode transform in TTNN to a multimode transform with nonlinear activation, effectively capturing the intrinsic multimode spatiotemporal correlations and low-rankness of the traffic tensor, represented as location $\times$ location $\times$ time. To solve the nonconvex optimization problem, we design a proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees. We suggest an Augmented Transform-based Tensor Nuclear Norm Families (ATTNNs) framework to enhance the imputation results of TTNN techniques, especially at very high miss rates. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed MNT-TNN and ATTNNs can outperform the compared state-of-the-art imputation methods, completing the benchmark of random missing traffic value imputation.</description>

      <title>Multimodal machine learning with large language embedding model for polymer property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Federated Learning Through Secure Cluster-Weighted Client Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across decentralized devices without the need for raw data sharing. In FL, a global model is trained iteratively on local datasets residing on individual devices, each contributing to the model's improvement. However, the heterogeneous nature of these local datasets, stemming from diverse user behaviours, device capabilities, and data distributions, poses a significant challenge. The inherent heterogeneity in federated learning gives rise to various issues, including model performance discrepancies, convergence challenges, and potential privacy concerns. As the global model progresses through rounds of training, the disparities in local data quality and quantity can impede the overall effectiveness of federated learning systems. Moreover, maintaining fairness and privacy across diverse user groups becomes a paramount concern. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel FL framework, ClusterGuardFL, that employs dissimilarity scores, k-means clustering, and reconciliation confidence scores to dynamically assign weights to client updates. The dissimilarity scores between global and local models guide the formation of clusters, with cluster size influencing the weight allocation. Within each cluster, a reconciliation confidence score is calculated for individual data points, and a softmax layer generates customized weights for clients. These weights are utilized in the aggregation process, enhancing the model's robustness and privacy. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving improved model performance in diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>DC-SGD: Differentially Private SGD with Dynamic Clipping through Gradient Norm Distribution Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is a widely adopted technique for privacy-preserving deep learning. A critical challenge in DP-SGD is selecting the optimal clipping threshold C, which involves balancing the trade-off between clipping bias and noise magnitude, incurring substantial privacy and computing overhead during hyperparameter tuning.
  In this paper, we propose Dynamic Clipping DP-SGD (DC-SGD), a framework that leverages differentially private histograms to estimate gradient norm distributions and dynamically adjust the clipping threshold C. Our framework includes two novel mechanisms: DC-SGD-P and DC-SGD-E. DC-SGD-P adjusts the clipping threshold based on a percentile of gradient norms, while DC-SGD-E minimizes the expected squared error of gradients to optimize C. These dynamic adjustments significantly reduce the burden of hyperparameter tuning C. The extensive experiments on various deep learning tasks, including image classification and natural language processing, show that our proposed dynamic algorithms achieve up to 9 times acceleration on hyperparameter tuning than DP-SGD. And DC-SGD-E can achieve an accuracy improvement of 10.62% on CIFAR10 than DP-SGD under the same privacy budget of hyperparameter tuning. We conduct rigorous theoretical privacy and convergence analyses, showing that our methods seamlessly integrate with the Adam optimizer. Our results highlight the robust performance and efficiency of DC-SGD, offering a practical solution for differentially private deep learning with reduced computational overhead and enhanced privacy guarantees.</description>

      <title>AuditVotes: A Framework Towards More Deployable Certified Robustness for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), adaptive attacks continue to challenge their robustness. Certified robustness based on randomized smoothing has emerged as a promising solution, offering provable guarantees that a model's predictions remain stable under adversarial perturbations within a specified range. However, existing methods face a critical trade-off between accuracy and robustness, as achieving stronger robustness requires introducing greater noise into the input graph. This excessive randomization degrades data quality and disrupts prediction consistency, limiting the practical deployment of certifiably robust GNNs in real-world scenarios where both accuracy and robustness are essential. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{AuditVotes}, the first framework to achieve both high clean accuracy and certifiably robust accuracy for GNNs. It integrates randomized smoothing with two key components, \underline{au}gmentation and con\underline{dit}ional smoothing, aiming to improve data quality and prediction consistency. The augmentation, acting as a pre-processing step, de-noises the randomized graph, significantly improving data quality and clean accuracy. The conditional smoothing, serving as a post-processing step, employs a filtering function to selectively count votes, thereby filtering low-quality predictions and improving voting consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AuditVotes significantly enhances clean accuracy, certified robustness, and empirical robustness while maintaining high computational efficiency. Notably, compared to baseline randomized smoothing, AuditVotes improves clean accuracy by $437.1\%$ and certified accuracy by $409.3\%$ when the attacker can arbitrarily insert $20$ edges on the Cora-ML datasets, representing a substantial step toward deploying certifiably robust GNNs in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Buyer-Initiated Auction Mechanism for Data Redemption in Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised privacy concerns over user data, leading to regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). With the essential toolbox provided by machine unlearning, AI service providers are now able to remove user data from their trained models as well as the training datasets, so as to comply with such regulations. However, extensive data redemption can be costly and degrade model accuracy. To balance the cost of unlearning and the privacy protection, we propose a buyer-initiated auction mechanism for data redemption, enabling the service provider to purchase data from willing users with appropriate compensation. This approach does not require the server to have any a priori knowledge about the users' privacy preference, and provides an efficient solution for maximizing the social welfare in the investigated problem.</description>

      <title>Learning Structure-enhanced Temporal Point Processes with Gromov-Wasserstein Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world event sequences are often generated by different temporal point processes (TPPs) and thus have clustering structures. Nonetheless, in the modeling and prediction of event sequences, most existing TPPs ignore the inherent clustering structures of the event sequences, leading to the models with unsatisfactory interpretability. In this study, we learn structure-enhanced TPPs with the help of Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) regularization, which imposes clustering structures on the sequence-level embeddings of the TPPs in the maximum likelihood estimation framework.In the training phase, the proposed method leverages a nonparametric TPP kernel to regularize the similarity matrix derived based on the sequence embeddings. In large-scale applications, we sample the kernel matrix and implement the regularization as a Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy term, which achieves a trade-off between regularity and computational efficiency.The TPPs learned through this method result in clustered sequence embeddings and demonstrate competitive predictive and clustering performance, significantly improving the model interpretability without compromising prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>MSNGO: multi-species protein function annotation based on 3D protein structure and network propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: In recent years, protein function prediction has broken through the bottleneck of sequence features, significantly improving prediction accuracy using high-precision protein structures predicted by AlphaFold2. While single-species protein function prediction methods have achieved remarkable success, multi-species protein function prediction methods are still in the stage of using PPI networks and sequence features. Providing effective cross-species label propagation for species with sparse protein annotations remains a challenging issue. To address this problem, we propose the MSNGO model, which integrates structural features and network propagation methods. Our validation shows that using structural features can significantly improve the accuracy of multi-species protein function prediction. Results: We employ graph representation learning techniques to extract amino acid representations from protein structure contact maps and train a structural model using a graph convolution pooling module to derive protein-level structural features. After incorporating the sequence features from ESM-2, we apply a network propagation algorithm to aggregate information and update node representations within a heterogeneous network. The results demonstrate that MSNGO outperforms previous multi-species protein function prediction methods that rely on sequence features and PPI networks.

      <title>Towards Understanding the Optimization Mechanisms in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we adopt a probability distribution estimation perspective to explore the optimization mechanisms of supervised classification using deep neural networks. We demonstrate that, when employing the Fenchel-Young loss, despite the non-convex nature of the fitting error with respect to the model's parameters, global optimal solutions can be approximated by simultaneously minimizing both the gradient norm and the structural error. The former can be controlled through gradient descent algorithms. For the latter, we prove that it can be managed by increasing the number of parameters and ensuring parameter independence, thereby providing theoretical insights into mechanisms such as over-parameterization and random initialization. Ultimately, the paper validates the key conclusions of the proposed method through empirical results, illustrating its practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Function Fitting Based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and Kernel Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a unified theoretical framework based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and kernel methods. By analyzing the mathematical relationship among kernels, B-spline basis functions in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and the inner product operation in self-attention mechanisms, we establish a kernel-based feature fitting framework that unifies the two models as linear combinations of kernel functions. Under this framework, we propose a low-rank Pseudo-Multi-Head Self-Attention module (Pseudo-MHSA), which reduces the parameter count of traditional MHSA by nearly 50\%. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian kernel multi-head self-attention variant (Gaussian-MHSA) to validate the effectiveness of nonlinear kernel functions in feature extraction. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that Pseudo-MHSA model achieves performance comparable to the ViT model of the same dimensionality under the MAE framework and visualization analysis reveals their similarity of multi-head distribution patterns. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission with clinical notes and EHR information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High hospital readmission rates are associated with significant costs and health risks for patients. Therefore, it is critical to develop predictive models that can support clinicians to determine whether or not a patient will return to the hospital in a relatively short period of time (e.g, 30-days). Nowadays, it is possible to collect both structured (electronic health records - EHR) and unstructured information (clinical notes) about a patient hospital event, all potentially containing relevant information for a predictive model. However, their integration is challenging. In this work we explore the combination of clinical notes and EHRs to predict 30-day hospital readmissions. We address the representation of the various types of information available in the EHR data, as well as exploring LLMs to characterize the clinical notes. We collect both information sources as the nodes of a graph neural network (GNN). Our model achieves an AUROC of 0.72 and a balanced accuracy of 66.7\%, highlighting the importance of combining the multimodal information.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series across Heterogeneous Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of digital services, along with the scale and complexity at which they operate, has made incidents in IT operations increasingly more likely, diverse, and impactful. This has led to the rapid development of a central aspect of "Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations" (AIOps), focusing on detecting anomalies in vast amounts of multivariate time series data generated by service entities. In this paper, we begin by introducing a unifying framework for benchmarking unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, and highlight the problem of shifts in normal behaviors that can occur in practical AIOps scenarios. To tackle anomaly detection under domain shift, we then cast the problem in the framework of domain generalization and propose a novel approach, Domain-Invariant VAE for Anomaly Detection (DIVAD), to learn domain-invariant representations for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our evaluation results using the Exathlon benchmark show that the two main DIVAD variants significantly outperform the best unsupervised AD method in maximum performance, with 20% and 15% improvements in maximum peak F1-scores, respectively. Evaluation using the Application Server Dataset further demonstrates the broader applicability of our domain generalization methods.</description>

      <title>TRACE: Intra-visit Clinical Event Nowcasting via Effective Patient Trajectory Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have become a valuable resource for a wide range of predictive tasks in healthcare. However, existing approaches have largely focused on inter-visit event predictions, overlooking the importance of intra-visit nowcasting, which provides prompt clinical insights during an ongoing patient visit. To address this gap, we introduce the task of laboratory measurement prediction within a hospital visit. We study the laboratory data that, however, remained underexplored in previous work. We propose TRACE, a Transformer-based model designed for clinical event nowcasting by encoding patient trajectories. TRACE effectively handles long sequences and captures temporal dependencies through a novel timestamp embedding that integrates decay properties and periodic patterns of data. Additionally, we introduce a smoothed mask for denoising, improving the robustness of the model. Experiments on two large-scale electronic health record datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous methods, highlighting its potential for improving patient care through more accurate laboratory measurement nowcasting.

      <title>Beyond Standard MoE: Mixture of Latent Experts for Resource-Efficient Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a pivotal architectural paradigm for efficient scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs), operating through selective activation of parameter subsets for each input token. Nevertheless, conventional MoE architectures encounter substantial challenges, including excessive memory utilization and communication overhead during training and inference, primarily attributable to the proliferation of expert modules. In this paper, we introduce Mixture of Latent Experts (MoLE), a novel parameterization methodology that facilitates the mapping of specific experts into a shared latent space. Specifically, all expert operations are systematically decomposed into two principal components: a shared projection into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by expert-specific transformations with significantly reduced parametric complexity. This factorized approach substantially diminishes parameter count and computational requirements. Beyond the pretraining implementation of the MoLE architecture, we also establish a rigorous mathematical framework for transforming pre-trained MoE models into the MoLE architecture, characterizing the sufficient conditions for optimal factorization and developing a systematic two-phase algorithm for this conversion process. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrates that MoLE significantly enhances computational efficiency across multiple dimensions while preserving model representational capacity. Empirical evaluations corroborate our theoretical findings, confirming that MoLE achieves performance comparable to standard MoE implementations while substantially reducing resource requirements.</description>

      <title>RL2Grid: Benchmarking Reinforcement Learning in Power Grid Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can transform power grid operations by providing adaptive and scalable controllers essential for grid decarbonization. However, existing methods struggle with the complex dynamics, aleatoric uncertainty, long-horizon goals, and hard physical constraints that occur in real-world systems. This paper presents RL2Grid, a benchmark designed in collaboration with power system operators to accelerate progress in grid control and foster RL maturity. Built on a power simulation framework developed by RTE France, RL2Grid standardizes tasks, state and action spaces, and reward structures within a unified interface for a systematic evaluation and comparison of RL approaches. Moreover, we integrate real control heuristics and safety constraints informed by the operators' expertise to ensure RL2Grid aligns with grid operation requirements. We benchmark popular RL baselines on the grid control tasks represented within RL2Grid, establishing reference performance metrics. Our results and discussion highlight the challenges that power grids pose for RL methods, emphasizing the need for novel algorithms capable of handling real-world physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate forecasting of geomagnetic activity is important. In this work, we present a novel multimodal Transformer based framework for predicting the 3 days and 5 days planetary Kp index by integrating heterogeneous data sources, including satellite measurements, solar images, and KP time series. A key innovation is the incorporation of the Wasserstein distance into the transformer and the loss function to align the probability distributions across modalities. Comparative experiments with the NOAA model demonstrate performance, accurately capturing both the quiet and storm phases of geomagnetic activity. This study underscores the potential of integrating machine learning techniques with traditional models for improved real time forecasting.</description>

      <title>Fast Training of Recurrent Neural Networks with Stationary State Feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently demonstrated strong performance and faster inference than Transformers at comparable parameter budgets. However, the recursive gradient computation with the backpropagation through time (or BPTT) algorithm remains the major computational bottleneck. In this work, we propose a novel method that replaces BPTT with a fixed gradient feedback mechanism, yielding an efficient approximation of the exact gradient propagation based on the assumption of time stationarity. Our approach leverages state-space model (SSM) principles to define a structured feedback matrix that directly propagates gradients from future time steps. This formulation bypasses the need for recursive gradient backpropagation, significantly reducing training overhead while preserving the network's ability to capture long-term dependencies. The experiments on language modeling benchmarks exhibit competitive perplexity scores, while significantly reducing the training costs. These promising results suggest that designing a feedback method like an SSM can fully exploit the efficiency advantages of RNNs for many practical applications.</description>

      <title>How to safely discard features based on aggregate SHAP values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SHAP is one of the most popular local feature-attribution methods. Given a function f and an input x, it quantifies each feature's contribution to f(x). Recently, SHAP has been increasingly used for global insights: practitioners average the absolute SHAP values over many data points to compute global feature importance scores, which are then used to discard unimportant features. In this work, we investigate the soundness of this practice by asking whether small aggregate SHAP values necessarily imply that the corresponding feature does not affect the function. Unfortunately, the answer is no: even if the i-th SHAP value is 0 on the entire data support, there exist functions that clearly depend on Feature i. The issue is that computing SHAP values involves evaluating f on points outside of the data support, where f can be strategically designed to mask its dependence on Feature i. To address this, we propose to aggregate SHAP values over the extended support, which is the product of the marginals of the underlying distribution. With this modification, we show that a small aggregate SHAP value implies that we can safely discard the corresponding feature. We then extend our results to KernelSHAP, the most popular method to approximate SHAP values in practice. We show that if KernelSHAP is computed over the extended distribution, a small aggregate value justifies feature removal. This result holds independently of whether KernelSHAP accurately approximates true SHAP values, making it one of the first theoretical results to characterize the KernelSHAP algorithm itself. Our findings have both theoretical and practical implications. We introduce the Shapley Lie algebra, which offers algebraic insights that may enable a deeper investigation of SHAP and we show that randomly permuting each column of the data matrix enables safely discarding features based on aggregate SHAP and KernelSHAP values.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Modeling and Deep Neural Networks for Establishing Digital Twins of Secure Facilities under Sensing Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin technologies help practitioners simulate, monitor, and predict undesirable outcomes in-silico, while avoiding the cost and risks of conducting live simulation exercises. Virtual reality (VR) based digital twin technologies are especially useful when monitoring human Patterns of Life (POL) in secure nuclear facilities, where live simulation exercises are too dangerous and costly to ever perform. However, the high-security status of such facilities may restrict modelers from deploying human activity sensors for data collection. This problem was encountered when deploying MetaPOL, a digital twin system to prevent insider threat or sabotage of secure facilities, at a secure nuclear reactor facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). This challenge was addressed using an agent-based model (ABM), driven by anecdotal evidence of facility personnel POL, to generate synthetic movement trajectories. These synthetic trajectories were then used to train deep neural network surrogates for next location and stay duration prediction to drive NPCs in the VR environment. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of this technique for establishing NPC movement within MetaPOL and the ability to distinguish NPC movement during normal operations from that during a simulated emergency response. Our results demonstrate the success of using a multi-layer perceptron for next location prediction and mixture density network for stay duration prediction to predict the ABM generated trajectories. We also find that NPC movement in the VR environment driven by the deep neural networks under normal operations remain significantly different to that seen when simulating responses to a simulated emergency scenario.</description>

      <title>Reasoning-SQL: Reinforcement Learning with SQL Tailored Partial Rewards for Reasoning-Enhanced Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a challenging task involving multiple reasoning-intensive subtasks, including natural language understanding, database schema comprehension, and precise SQL query formulation. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted reasoning paths with inductive biases that can limit their overall effectiveness. Motivated by the recent success of reasoning-enhanced models such as DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o1, which effectively leverage reward-driven self-exploration to enhance reasoning capabilities and generalization, we propose a novel set of partial rewards tailored specifically for the Text-to-SQL task. Our reward set includes schema-linking, AI feedback, n-gram similarity, and syntax check, explicitly designed to address the reward sparsity issue prevalent in reinforcement learning (RL). Leveraging group relative policy optimization (GRPO), our approach explicitly encourages large language models (LLMs) to develop intrinsic reasoning skills necessary for accurate SQL query generation. With models of different sizes, we demonstrate that RL-only training with our proposed rewards consistently achieves higher accuracy and superior generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Remarkably, our RL-trained 14B-parameter model significantly outperforms larger proprietary models, e.g. o3-mini by 4% and Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 by 3% on the BIRD benchmark. These highlight the efficacy of our proposed RL-training framework with partial rewards for enhancing both accuracy and reasoning capabilities in Text-to-SQL tasks.</description>

      <title>Graph ODEs and Beyond: A Comprehensive Survey on Integrating Differential Equations with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and differential equations (DEs) are two rapidly advancing areas of research that have shown remarkable synergy in recent years. GNNs have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, while differential equations provide a principled framework for modeling continuous dynamics across time and space. The intersection of these fields has led to innovative approaches that leverage the strengths of both, enabling applications in physics-informed learning, spatiotemporal modeling, and scientific computing. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the burgeoning research at the intersection of GNNs and DEs. We will categorize existing methods, discuss their underlying principles, and highlight their applications across domains such as molecular modeling, traffic prediction, and epidemic spreading. Furthermore, we identify open challenges and outline future research directions to advance this interdisciplinary field. A comprehensive paper list is provided at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/Awesome-Graph-NDEs. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and contribute to the fusion of GNNs and DEs</description>

      <title>TRA: Better Length Generalisation with Threshold Relative Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers struggle with length generalisation, displaying poor performance even on basic tasks. We test whether these limitations can be explained through two key failures of the self-attention mechanism. The first is the inability to fully remove irrelevant information. The second is tied to position, even if the dot product between a key and query is highly negative (i.e. an irrelevant key) learned positional biases may unintentionally up-weight such information - dangerous when distances become out of distribution. Put together, these two failure cases lead to compounding generalisation difficulties. We test whether they can be mitigated through the combination of a) selective sparsity - completely removing irrelevant keys from the attention softmax and b) contextualised relative distance - distance is only considered as between the query and the keys that matter. We show how refactoring the attention mechanism with these two mitigations in place can substantially improve generalisation capabilities of decoder only transformers.</description>

      <title>A QUBO Framework for Team Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The team formation problem assumes a set of experts and a task, where each expert has a set of skills and the task requires some skills. The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning: Comparative Analysis of Clustering Techniques on High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of prominent clustering algorithms K-means, DBSCAN, and Spectral Clustering on high-dimensional datasets. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that assesses clustering performance across multiple dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP) using diverse quantitative metrics. Experiments conducted on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and UCI HAR datasets reveal that preprocessing with UMAP consistently improves clustering quality across all algorithms, with Spectral Clustering demonstrating superior performance on complex manifold structures. Our findings show that algorithm selection should be guided by data characteristics, with Kmeans excelling in computational efficiency, DBSCAN in handling irregular clusters, and Spectral Clustering in capturing complex relationships. This research contributes a systematic approach for evaluating and selecting clustering techniques for high dimensional data applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models provide significant new opportunities for the generation of high-quality written works. However, their employment in the research community is inhibited by their tendency to hallucinate invalid sources and lack of direct access to a knowledge base of relevant scientific articles. In this work, we present Citegeist: An application pipeline using dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on the arXiv Corpus to generate a related work section and other citation-backed outputs. For this purpose, we employ a mixture of embedding-based similarity matching, summarization, and multi-stage filtering. To adapt to the continuous growth of the document base, we also present an optimized way of incorporating new and modified papers. To enable easy utilization in the scientific community, we release both, a website (https://citegeist.org), as well as an implementation harness that works with several different LLM implementations.</description>

      <title>UP-ROM : Uncertainty-Aware and Parametrised dynamic Reduced-Order Model, application to unsteady flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) play a critical role in fluid mechanics by providing low-cost predictions, making them an attractive tool for engineering applications. However, for ROMs to be widely applicable, they must not only generalise well across different regimes, but also provide a measure of confidence in their predictions. While recent data-driven approaches have begun to address nonlinear reduction techniques to improve predictions in transient environments, challenges remain in terms of robustness and parametrisation. In this work, we present a nonlinear reduction strategy specifically designed for transient flows that incorporates parametrisation and uncertainty quantification. Our reduction strategy features a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that uses variational inference for confidence measurement. We use a latent space transformer that incorporates recent advances in attention mechanisms to predict dynamical systems. Attention's versatility in learning sequences and capturing their dependence on external parameters enhances generalisation across a wide range of dynamics. Prediction, coupled with confidence, enables more informed decision making and addresses the need for more robust models. In addition, this confidence is used to cost-effectively sample the parameter space, improving model performance a priori across the entire parameter space without requiring evaluation data for the entire domain.</description>

      <title>Two Heads Are Better than One: Model-Weight and Latent-Space Analysis for Federated Learning on Non-iid Data against Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning is a popular paradigm that enables remote clients to jointly train a global model without sharing their raw data. However, FL has been shown to be vulnerable towards model poisoning attacks due to its distributed nature. Particularly, attackers acting as participants can upload arbitrary model updates that effectively compromise the global model of FL. While extensive research has been focusing on fighting against these attacks, we find that most of them assume data at remote clients are under iid while in practice they are inevitably non-iid. Our benchmark evaluations reveal that existing defenses generally fail to live up to their reputation when applied to various non-iid scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, GeminiGuard, that aims to address such a significant gap. We design GeminiGuard to be lightweight, versatile, and unsupervised so that it aligns well with the practical requirements of deploying such defenses. The key challenge from non-iids is that they make benign model updates look more similar to malicious ones. GeminiGuard is mainly built on two fundamental observations: (1) existing defenses based on either model-weight analysis or latent-space analysis face limitations in covering different MPAs and non-iid scenarios, and (2) model-weight and latent-space analysis are sufficiently different yet potentially complementary methods as MPA defenses. We hence incorporate a novel model-weight analysis component as well as a custom latent-space analysis component in GeminiGuard, aiming to further enhance its defense performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our defense across various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in countering multiple types of untargeted and targeted MPAs, including adaptive ones. Our comprehensive evaluations show that GeminiGuard consistently outperforms SOTA defenses under various settings.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Physics-Informed Neural Networks with a Hybrid Parallel Kolmogorov-Arnold and MLP Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex physical systems, yet balancing high accuracy with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge in their convergence behavior. In this work, we propose the Hybrid Parallel Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Physics-Informed Neural Network (HPKM-PINN), a novel architecture that synergistically integrates parallelized KAN and MLP branches within a unified PINN framework. The HPKM-PINN introduces a scaling factor {\xi}, to optimally balance the complementary strengths of KAN's interpretable function approximation and MLP's nonlinear feature learning, thereby enhancing predictive performance through a weighted fusion of their outputs. Through systematic numerical evaluations, we elucidate the impact of the scaling factor {\xi} on the model's performance in both function approximation and partial differential equation (PDE) solving tasks. Benchmark experiments across canonical PDEs, such as the Poisson and Advection equations, demonstrate that HPKM-PINN achieves a marked decrease in loss values (reducing relative error by two orders of magnitude) compared to standalone KAN or MLP models. Furthermore, the framework exhibits numerical stability and robustness when applied to various physical systems. These findings highlight the HPKM-PINN's ability to leverage KAN's interpretability and MLP's expressivity, positioning it as a versatile and scalable tool for solving complex PDE-driven problems in computational science and engineering.</description>

      <title>SalesRLAgent: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Real-Time Sales Conversion Prediction and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches to sales conversation analysis and conversion prediction typically rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with basic retrieval augmented generation (RAG). These systems, while capable of answering questions, fail to accurately predict conversion probability or provide strategic guidance in real time. In this paper, we present SalesRLAgent, a novel framework leveraging specialized reinforcement learning to predict conversion probability throughout sales conversations. Unlike systems from Kapa.ai, Mendable, Inkeep, and others that primarily use off-the-shelf LLMs for content generation, our approach treats conversion prediction as a sequential decision problem, training on synthetic data generated using GPT-4O to develop a specialized probability estimation model. Our system incorporates Azure OpenAI embeddings (3072 dimensions), turn-by-turn state tracking, and meta-learning capabilities to understand its own knowledge boundaries. Evaluations demonstrate that SalesRLAgent achieves 96.7% accuracy in conversion prediction, outperforming LLM-only approaches by 34.7% while offering significantly faster inference (85ms vs 3450ms for GPT-4). Furthermore, integration with existing sales platforms shows a 43.2% increase in conversion rates when representatives utilize our system's real-time guidance. SalesRLAgent represents a fundamental shift from content generation to strategic sales intelligence, providing moment-by-moment conversion probability estimation with actionable insights for sales professionals.</description>

      <title>Solve sparse PCA problem by employing Hamiltonian system and leapfrog method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely utilized technique for dimensionality reduction; however, its inherent lack of interpretability-stemming from dense linear combinations of all feature-limits its applicability in many domains. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse PCA algorithm that imposes sparsity through a smooth L1 penalty and leverages a Hamiltonian formulation solved via geometric integration techniques. Specifically, we implement two distinct numerical methods-one based on the Proximal Gradient (ISTA) approach and another employing a leapfrog (fourth-order Runge-Kutta) scheme-to minimize the energy function that balances variance maximization with sparsity enforcement. To extract a subset of sparse principal components, we further incorporate a deflation technique and subsequently transform the original high-dimensional face data into a lower-dimensional feature space. Experimental evaluations on a face recognition dataset-using both k-nearest neighbor and kernel ridge regression classifiers-demonstrate that the proposed sparse PCA methods consistently achieve higher classification accuracy than conventional PCA. Future research will extend this framework to integrate sparse PCA with modern deep learning architectures for multimodal recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Pareto Continual Learning: Preference-Conditioned Learning and Adaption for Dynamic Stability-Plasticity Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning aims to learn multiple tasks sequentially. A key challenge in continual learning is balancing between two objectives: retaining knowledge from old tasks (stability) and adapting to new tasks (plasticity). Experience replay methods, which store and replay past data alongside new data, have become a widely adopted approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of the stability-plasticity trade-off and aim to find a fixed and unchanging balance, resulting in suboptimal adaptation during training and inference. In this paper, we propose Pareto Continual Learning (ParetoCL), a novel framework that reformulates the stability-plasticity trade-off in continual learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. ParetoCL introduces a preference-conditioned model to efficiently learn a set of Pareto optimal solutions representing different trade-offs and enables dynamic adaptation during inference. From a generalization perspective, ParetoCL can be seen as an objective augmentation approach that learns from different objective combinations of stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and settings demonstrate that ParetoCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods and adapts to diverse continual learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>What Makes an Evaluation Useful? Common Pitfalls and Best Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the rapid increase in Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities in recent years, the AI community has voiced concerns regarding possible safety risks. To support decision-making on the safe use and development of AI systems, there is a growing need for high-quality evaluations of dangerous model capabilities. While several attempts to provide such evaluations have been made, a clear definition of what constitutes a "good evaluation" has yet to be agreed upon. In this practitioners' perspective paper, we present a set of best practices for safety evaluations, drawing on prior work in model evaluation and illustrated through cybersecurity examples. We first discuss the steps of the initial thought process, which connects threat modeling to evaluation design. Then, we provide the characteristics and parameters that make an evaluation useful. Finally, we address additional considerations as we move from building specific evaluations to building a full and comprehensive evaluation suite.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy GUI Agents: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GUI agents, powered by large foundation models, can interact with digital interfaces, enabling various applications in web automation, mobile navigation, and software testing. However, their increasing autonomy has raised critical concerns about their security, privacy, and safety. This survey examines the trustworthiness of GUI agents in five critical dimensions: security vulnerabilities, reliability in dynamic environments, transparency and explainability, ethical considerations, and evaluation methodologies. We also identify major challenges such as vulnerability to adversarial attacks, cascading failure modes in sequential decision-making, and a lack of realistic evaluation benchmarks. These issues not only hinder real-world deployment but also call for comprehensive mitigation strategies beyond task success. As GUI agents become more widespread, establishing robust safety standards and responsible development practices is essential. This survey provides a foundation for advancing trustworthy GUI agents through systematic understanding and future research.</description>

      <title>Handling Delay in Real-Time Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time reinforcement learning (RL) introduces several challenges. First, policies are constrained to a fixed number of actions per second due to hardware limitations. Second, the environment may change while the network is still computing an action, leading to observational delay. The first issue can partly be addressed with pipelining, leading to higher throughput and potentially better policies. However, the second issue remains: if each neuron operates in parallel with an execution time of $\tau$, an $N$-layer feed-forward network experiences observation delay of $\tau N$. Reducing the number of layers can decrease this delay, but at the cost of the network's expressivity. In this work, we explore the trade-off between minimizing delay and network's expressivity. We present a theoretically motivated solution that leverages temporal skip connections combined with history-augmented observations. We evaluate several architectures and show that those incorporating temporal skip connections achieve strong performance across various neuron execution times, reinforcement learning algorithms, and environments, including four Mujoco tasks and all MinAtar games. Moreover, we demonstrate parallel neuron computation can accelerate inference by 6-350% on standard hardware. Our investigation into temporal skip connections and parallel computations paves the way for more efficient RL agents in real-time setting.</description>

      <title>In-silico biological discovery with large perturbation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data generated in perturbation experiments link perturbations to the changes they elicit and therefore contain information relevant to numerous biological discovery tasks -- from understanding the relationships between biological entities to developing therapeutics. However, these data encompass diverse perturbations and readouts, and the complex dependence of experimental outcomes on their biological context makes it challenging to integrate insights across experiments. Here, we present the Large Perturbation Model (LPM), a deep-learning model that integrates multiple, heterogeneous perturbation experiments by representing perturbation, readout, and context as disentangled dimensions. LPM outperforms existing methods across multiple biological discovery tasks, including in predicting post-perturbation transcriptomes of unseen experiments, identifying shared molecular mechanisms of action between chemical and genetic perturbations, and facilitating the inference of gene-gene interaction networks.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Unlearnable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlearnable data (ULD) has emerged as an innovative defense technique to prevent machine learning models from learning meaningful patterns from specific data, thus protecting data privacy and security. By introducing perturbations to the training data, ULD degrades model performance, making it difficult for unauthorized models to extract useful representations. Despite the growing significance of ULD, existing surveys predominantly focus on related fields, such as adversarial attacks and machine unlearning, with little attention given to ULD as an independent area of study. This survey fills that gap by offering a comprehensive review of ULD, examining unlearnable data generation methods, public benchmarks, evaluation metrics, theoretical foundations and practical applications. We compare and contrast different ULD approaches, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and trade-offs related to unlearnability, imperceptibility, efficiency and robustness. Moreover, we discuss key challenges, such as balancing perturbation imperceptibility with model degradation and the computational complexity of ULD generation. Finally, we highlight promising future research directions to advance the effectiveness and applicability of ULD, underscoring its potential to become a crucial tool in the evolving landscape of data protection in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Redundant feature screening method for human activity recognition based on attention purification mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), deep neural networks provide advanced technical support. Many studies have proven that recognition accuracy can be improved by increasing the depth or width of the network. However, for wearable devices, the balance between network performance and resource consumption is crucial. With minimum resource consumption as the basic principle, we propose a universal attention feature purification mechanism, called MSAP, which is suitable for multi-scale networks. The mechanism effectively solves the feature redundancy caused by the superposition of multi-scale features by means of inter-scale attention screening and connection method. In addition, we have designed a network correction module that integrates seamlessly between layers of individual network modules to mitigate inherent problems in deep networks. We also built an embedded deployment system that is in line with the current level of wearable technology to test the practical feasibility of the HAR model, and further prove the efficiency of the method. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that the proposed method model effectively reduces redundant features in filtered data and provides excellent performance with little resource consumption.</description>

      <title>Bridging conformal prediction and scenario optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction and scenario optimization constitute two important classes of statistical learning frameworks to certify decisions made using data. They have found numerous applications in control theory, machine learning and robotics. Despite intense research in both areas, and apparently similar results, a clear connection between these two frameworks has not been established. By focusing on the so-called vanilla conformal prediction, we show rigorously how to choose appropriate score functions and set predictor map to recover well-known bounds on the probability of constraint violation associated with scenario programs. We also show how to treat ranking of nonconformity scores as a one-dimensional scenario program with discarded constraints, and use such connection to recover vanilla conformal prediction guarantees on the validity of the set predictor. We also capitalize on the main developments of the scenario approach, and show how we could analyze calibration conditional conformal prediction under this lens. Our results establish a theoretical bridge between conformal prediction and scenario optimization.</description>

      <title>Partial Transportability for Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental task in AI is providing performance guarantees for predictions made in unseen domains. In practice, there can be substantial uncertainty about the distribution of new data, and corresponding variability in the performance of existing predictors. Building on the theory of partial identification and transportability, this paper introduces new results for bounding the value of a functional of the target distribution, such as the generalization error of a classifier, given data from source domains and assumptions about the data generating mechanisms, encoded in causal diagrams. Our contribution is to provide the first general estimation technique for transportability problems, adapting existing parameterization schemes such Neural Causal Models to encode the structural constraints necessary for cross-population inference. We demonstrate the expressiveness and consistency of this procedure and further propose a gradient-based optimization scheme for making scalable inferences in practice. Our results are corroborated with experiments.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Learning with High-Dimensional Computing Architecture Similar to von Neumann's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model human and animal learning by computing with high-dimensional vectors (H = 10,000 for example). The architecture resembles traditional (von Neumann) computing with numbers, but the instructions refer to vectors and operate on them in superposition. The architecture includes a high-capacity memory for vectors, analogue of the random-access memory (RAM) for numbers. The model's ability to learn from data reminds us of deep learning, but with an architecture closer to biology. The architecture agrees with an idea from psychology that human memory and learning involve a short-term working memory and a long-term data store. Neuroscience provides us with a model of the long-term memory, namely, the cortex of the cerebellum. With roots in psychology, biology, and traditional computing, a theory of computing with vectors can help us understand how brains compute. Application to learning by robots seems inevitable, but there is likely to be more, including language. Ultimately we want to compute with no more material and energy than used by brains. To that end, we need a mathematical theory that agrees with psychology and biology, and is suitable for nanotechnology. We also need to exercise the theory in large-scale experiments. Computing with vectors is described here in terms familiar to us from traditional computing with numbers.</description>

      <title>Make Autoregressive Great Again: Diffusion-Free Graph Generation with Next-Scale Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive models are popular generative models due to their speed and properties. However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation-especially the success of visual autoregressive methods-we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Extensive experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrate that MAG delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to three orders of magnitude in speedup during inference.</description>

      <title>Graph-Eq: Discovering Mathematical Equations using Graph Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to discover meaningful, accurate, and concise mathematical equations that describe datasets is valuable across various domains. Equations offer explicit relationships between variables, enabling deeper insights into underlying data patterns. Most existing equation discovery methods rely on genetic programming, which iteratively searches the equation space but is often slow and prone to overfitting. By representing equations as directed acyclic graphs, we leverage the use of graph neural networks to learn the underlying semantics of equations, and generate new, previously unseen equations. Although graph generative models have been shown to be successful in discovering new types of graphs in many fields, there application in discovering equations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Graph-EQ, a deep graph generative model designed for efficient equation discovery. Graph-EQ uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a rich latent representation of the equation space by training it on a large corpus of equations in an unsupervised manner. Instead of directly searching the equation space, we employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore this learned latent space. We show that the encoder-decoder architecture of Graph-Eq is able to accurately reconstruct input equations. Moreover, we show that the learned latent representation can be sampled and decoded into valid equations, including new and previously unseen equations in the training data. Finally, we assess Graph-Eq's ability to discover equations that best fit a dataset by exploring the latent space using Bayesian optimization. Latent space exploration is done on 20 dataset with known ground-truth equations, and Graph-Eq is shown to successfully discover the grountruth equation in the majority of datasets.</description>

      <title>Simple Feedfoward Neural Networks are Almost All You Need for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series data are everywhere -- from finance to healthcare -- and each domain brings its own unique complexities and structures. While advanced models like Transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, largely due to their success in tasks like language modeling, their added complexity is not always necessary. In our work, we show that simple feedforward neural networks (SFNNs) can achieve performance on par with, or even exceeding, these state-of-the-art models, while being simpler, smaller, faster, and more robust. Our analysis indicates that, in many cases, univariate SFNNs are sufficient, implying that modeling interactions between multiple series may offer only marginal benefits. Even when inter-series relationships are strong, a basic multivariate SFNN still delivers competitive results. We also examine some key design choices and offer guidelines on making informed decisions. Additionally, we critique existing benchmarking practices and propose an improved evaluation protocol. Although SFNNs may not be optimal for every situation (hence the ``almost'' in our title) they serve as a strong baseline that future time series forecasting methods should always be compared against.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Reinforcement Learning-Based Motion Planning for Autonomous Driving: Lessons Learned from a Driving Task Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), with its ability to explore and optimize policies in complex, dynamic decision-making tasks, has emerged as a promising approach to addressing motion planning (MoP) challenges in autonomous driving (AD). Despite rapid advancements in RL and AD, a systematic description and interpretation of the RL design process tailored to diverse driving tasks remains underdeveloped. This survey provides a comprehensive review of RL-based MoP for AD, focusing on lessons from task-specific perspectives. We first outline the fundamentals of RL methodologies, and then survey their applications in MoP, analyzing scenario-specific features and task requirements to shed light on their influence on RL design choices. Building on this analysis, we summarize key design experiences, extract insights from various driving task applications, and provide guidance for future implementations. Additionally, we examine the frontier challenges in RL-based MoP, review recent efforts to addresse these challenges, and propose strategies for overcoming unresolved issues.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Operating System Scheduling Using Double DQN: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Task Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an operating system scheduling algorithm based on Double DQN (Double Deep Q network) is proposed, and its performance under different task types and system loads is verified by experiments. Compared with the traditional scheduling algorithm, the algorithm based on Double DQN can dynamically adjust the task priority and resource allocation strategy, thus improving the task completion efficiency, system throughput, and response speed. The experimental results show that the Double DQN algorithm has high scheduling performance under light load, medium load and heavy load scenarios, especially when dealing with I/O intensive tasks, and can effectively reduce task completion time and system response time. In addition, the algorithm also shows high optimization ability in resource utilization and can intelligently adjust resource allocation according to the system state, avoiding resource waste and excessive load. Future studies will further explore the application of the algorithm in more complex systems, especially scheduling optimization in cloud computing and large-scale distributed environments, combining factors such as network latency and energy efficiency to improve the overall performance and adaptability of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Forecasting of High-Dimensional Transient and Stationary Processes via Space-Time Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-Time Projection (STP) is introduced as a data-driven forecasting approach for high-dimensional and time-resolved data. The method computes extended space-time proper orthogonal modes from training data spanning a prediction horizon comprising both hindcast and forecast intervals. Forecasts are then generated by projecting the hindcast portion of these modes onto new data, simultaneously leveraging their orthogonality and optimal correlation with the forecast extension. Rooted in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) theory, dimensionality reduction and time-delay embedding are intrinsic to the approach. For a given ensemble and fixed prediction horizon, the only tunable parameter is the truncation rank--no additional hyperparameters are required. The hindcast accuracy serves as a reliable indicator for short-term forecast accuracy and establishes a lower bound on forecast errors. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated using two datasets: transient, highly anisotropic simulations of supernova explosions in a turbulent interstellar medium, and experimental velocity fields of a turbulent high-subsonic engineering flow. In a comparative study with standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks--acknowledging that alternative architectures or training strategies may yield different outcomes--the method consistently provided more accurate forecasts. Considering its simplicity and robust performance, STP offers an interpretable and competitive benchmark for forecasting high-dimensional transient and chaotic processes, relying purely on spatiotemporal correlation information.</description>

      <title>A Low-complexity Structured Neural Network to Realize States of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven learning is rapidly evolving and places a new perspective on realizing state-space dynamical systems. However, dynamical systems derived from nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) suffer from limitations in computational efficiency. Thus, this paper stems from data-driven learning to advance states of dynamical systems utilizing a structured neural network (StNN). The proposed learning technique also seeks to identify an optimal, low-complexity operator to solve dynamical systems, the so-called Hankel operator, derived from time-delay measurements. Thus, we utilize the StNN based on the Hankel operator to solve dynamical systems as an alternative to existing data-driven techniques. We show that the proposed StNN reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity compared with the conventional neural networks and also with the classical data-driven techniques, such as Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and Hankel Alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK), which is commonly known as delay-Dynamic Mode Decomposition(DMD) or Hankel-DMD. More specifically, we present numerical simulations to solve dynamical systems utilizing the StNN based on the Hankel operator beginning from the fundamental Lotka-Volterra model, where we compare the StNN with the LEarning Across Dynamical Systems (LEADS), and extend our analysis to highly nonlinear and chaotic Lorenz systems, comparing the StNN with conventional neural networks, SINDy, and HAVOK. Hence, we show that the proposed StNN paves the way for realizing state-space dynamical systems with a low-complexity learning algorithm, enabling prediction and understanding of future states.</description>

      <title>Steering Large Agent Populations using Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridges with Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridge (MFSB) problem is an optimization problem aiming to find the minimum effort control policy to drive a McKean-Vlassov stochastic differential equation from one probability measure to another. In the context of multiagent control, the objective is to control the configuration of a swarm of identical, interacting cooperative agents, as captured by the time-varying probability measure of their state. Available methods for solving this problem for distributions with continuous support rely either on spatial discretizations of the problem's domain or on approximating optimal solutions using neural networks trained through stochastic optimization schemes. For agents following Linear Time-Varying dynamics, and for Gaussian Mixture Model boundary distributions, we propose a highly efficient parameterization to approximate the solutions of the corresponding MFSB in closed form, without any learning steps. Our proposed approach consists of a mixture of elementary policies, each solving a Gaussian-to-Gaussian Covariance Steering problem from the components of the initial to the components of the terminal mixture. Leveraging the semidefinite formulation of the Covariance Steering problem, our proposed solver can handle probabilistic hard constraints on the system's state, while maintaining numerical tractability. We illustrate our approach on a variety of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Unimodal-driven Distillation in Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Dynamic Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (MERC) identifies emotional states across text, audio and video, which is essential for intelligent dialogue systems and opinion analysis. Existing methods emphasize heterogeneous modal fusion directly for cross-modal integration, but often suffer from disorientation in multimodal learning due to modal heterogeneity and lack of instructive guidance. In this work, we propose SUMMER, a novel heterogeneous multimodal integration framework leveraging Mixture of Experts with Hierarchical Cross-modal Fusion and Interactive Knowledge Distillation. Key components include a Sparse Dynamic Mixture of Experts (SDMoE) for capturing dynamic token-wise interactions, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion (HCMF) for effective fusion of heterogeneous modalities, and Interactive Knowledge Distillation (IKD), which uses a pre-trained unimodal teacher to guide multimodal fusion in latent and logit spaces. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show SUMMER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in recognizing minority and semantically similar emotions.</description>

      <title>PDSL: Privacy-Preserved Decentralized Stochastic Learning with Heterogeneous Data Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paradigm of decentralized learning, a group of agents collaborates to learn a global model using distributed datasets without a central server. However, due to the heterogeneity of the local data across the different agents, learning a robust global model is rather challenging. Moreover, the collaboration of the agents relies on their gradient information exchange, which poses a risk of privacy leakage. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose PDSL, a novel privacy-preserved decentralized stochastic learning algorithm with heterogeneous data distribution. On one hand, we innovate in utilizing the notion of Shapley values such that each agent can precisely measure the contributions of its heterogeneous neighbors to the global learning goal; on the other hand, we leverage the notion of differential privacy to prevent each agent from suffering privacy leakage when it contributes gradient information to its neighbors. We conduct both solid theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our PDSL algorithm in terms of privacy preservation and convergence.</description>

      <title>Time-Series Forecasting via Topological Information Supervised Framework with Efficient Topological Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful features from complex data structures, driving significant advancements in fields such as neuroscience, biology, machine learning, and financial modeling. Despite its success, the integration of TDA with time-series prediction remains underexplored due to three primary challenges: the limited utilization of temporal dependencies within topological features, computational bottlenecks associated with persistent homology, and the deterministic nature of TDA pipelines restricting generalized feature learning. This study addresses these challenges by proposing the Topological Information Supervised (TIS) Prediction framework, which leverages neural networks and Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to generate synthetic topological features, preserving their distribution while significantly reducing computational time. We propose a novel training strategy that integrates topological consistency loss to improve the predictive accuracy of deep learning models. Specifically, we introduce two state-of-the-art models, TIS-BiGRU and TIS-Informer, designed to capture short-term and long-term temporal dependencies, respectively. Comparative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of TIS models over conventional predictors, validating the effectiveness of integrating topological information. This work not only advances TDA-based time-series prediction but also opens new avenues for utilizing topological features in deep learning architectures.</description>

      <title>Accelerating High-Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Discovery via Pretrained Graph Neural Networks and Generative Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials offer a promising avenue toward cost-effective solar energy utilization. However, optimizing donor-acceptor (D-A) combinations to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates large-scale pretraining of graph neural networks (GNNs) with a GPT-2 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 2)-based reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to design OPV molecules with potentially high PCE. This approach produces candidate molecules with predicted efficiencies approaching 21\%, although further experimental validation is required. Moreover, we conducted a preliminary fragment-level analysis to identify structural motifs recognized by the RL model that may contribute to enhanced PCE, thus providing design guidelines for the broader research community. To facilitate continued discovery, we are building the largest open-source OPV dataset to date, expected to include nearly 3,000 donor-acceptor pairs. Finally, we discuss plans to collaborate with experimental teams on synthesizing and characterizing AI-designed molecules, which will provide new data to refine and improve our predictive and generative models.</description>

      <title>An extension of linear self-attention for in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning is a remarkable property of transformers and has been the focus of recent research. An attention mechanism is a key component in transformers, in which an attention matrix encodes relationships between words in a sentence and is used as weights for words in a sentence. This mechanism is effective for capturing language representations. However, it is questionable whether naive self-attention is suitable for in-context learning in general tasks, since the computation implemented by self-attention is somewhat restrictive in terms of matrix multiplication. In fact, we may need appropriate input form designs when considering heuristic implementations of computational algorithms. In this paper, in case of linear self-attention, we extend it by introducing a bias matrix in addition to a weight matrix for an input. Despite the simple extension, the extended linear self-attention can output any constant matrix, input matrix and multiplications of two or three matrices in the input. Note that the second property implies that it can be a skip connection. Therefore, flexible matrix manipulations can be implemented by connecting the extended linear self-attention components. As an example of implementation using the extended linear self-attention, we show a heuristic construction of a batch-type gradient descent of ridge regression under a reasonable input form.</description>

      <title>Conformal uncertainty quantification to evaluate predictive fairness of foundation AI model for skin lesion classes across patient demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning based diagnostic AI systems based on medical images are starting to provide similar performance as human experts. However these data hungry complex systems are inherently black boxes and therefore slow to be adopted for high risk applications like healthcare. This problem of lack of transparency is exacerbated in the case of recent large foundation models, which are trained in a self supervised manner on millions of data points to provide robust generalisation across a range of downstream tasks, but the embeddings generated from them happen through a process that is not interpretable, and hence not easily trustable for clinical applications. To address this timely issue, we deploy conformal analysis to quantify the predictive uncertainty of a vision transformer (ViT) based foundation model across patient demographics with respect to sex, age and ethnicity for the tasks of skin lesion classification using several public benchmark datasets. The significant advantage of this method is that conformal analysis is method independent and it not only provides a coverage guarantee at population level but also provides an uncertainty score for each individual. We used a model-agnostic dynamic F1-score-based sampling during model training, which helped to stabilize the class imbalance and we investigate the effects on uncertainty quantification (UQ) with or without this bias mitigation step. Thus we show how this can be used as a fairness metric to evaluate the robustness of the feature embeddings of the foundation model (Google DermFoundation) and thus advance the trustworthiness and fairness of clinical AI.</description>

      <title>When Counterfactual Reasoning Fails: Chaos and Real-World Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a cornerstone of human cognition and decision-making, is often seen as the 'holy grail' of causal learning, with applications ranging from interpreting machine learning models to promoting algorithmic fairness. While counterfactual reasoning has been extensively studied in contexts where the underlying causal model is well-defined, real-world causal modeling is often hindered by model and parameter uncertainty, observational noise, and chaotic behavior. The reliability of counterfactual analysis in such settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the limitations of counterfactual reasoning within the framework of Structural Causal Models. Specifically, we empirically investigate \emph{counterfactual sequence estimation} and highlight cases where it becomes increasingly unreliable. We find that realistic assumptions, such as low degrees of model uncertainty or chaotic dynamics, can result in counterintuitive outcomes, including dramatic deviations between predicted and true counterfactual trajectories. This work urges caution when applying counterfactual reasoning in settings characterized by chaos and uncertainty. Furthermore, it raises the question of whether certain systems may pose fundamental limitations on the ability to answer counterfactual questions about their behavior.</description>

      <title>Node Embeddings via Neighbor Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph layouts and node embeddings are two distinct paradigms for non-parametric graph representation learning. In the former, nodes are embedded into 2D space for visualization purposes. In the latter, nodes are embedded into a high-dimensional vector space for downstream processing. State-of-the-art algorithms for these two paradigms, force-directed layouts and random-walk-based contrastive learning (such as DeepWalk and node2vec), have little in common. In this work, we show that both paradigms can be approached with a single coherent framework based on established neighbor embedding methods. Specifically, we introduce graph t-SNE, a neighbor embedding method for two-dimensional graph layouts, and graph CNE, a contrastive neighbor embedding method that produces high-dimensional node representations by optimizing the InfoNCE objective. We show that both graph t-SNE and graph CNE strongly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of local structure preservation, while being conceptually simpler.</description>

      <title>An extrapolated and provably convergent algorithm for nonlinear matrix decomposition with the ReLU function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear matrix decomposition (NMD) with the ReLU function, denoted ReLU-NMD, is the following problem: given a sparse, nonnegative matrix $X$ and a factorization rank $r$, identify a rank-$r$ matrix $\Theta$ such that $X\approx \max(0,\Theta)$. This decomposition finds application in data compression, matrix completion with entries missing not at random, and manifold learning. The standard ReLU-NMD model minimizes the least squares error, that is, $\|X - \max(0,\Theta)\|_F^2$. The corresponding optimization problem is nondifferentiable and highly nonconvex. This motivated Saul to propose an alternative model, Latent-ReLU-NMD, where a latent variable $Z$ is introduced and satisfies $\max(0,Z)=X$ while minimizing $\|Z - \Theta\|_F^2$ (``A nonlinear matrix decomposition for mining the zeros of sparse data'', SIAM J. Math. Data Sci., 2022). Our first contribution is to show that the two formulations may yield different low-rank solutions $\Theta$; in particular, we show that Latent-ReLU-NMD can be ill-posed when ReLU-NMD is not, meaning that there are instances in which the infimum of Latent-ReLU-NMD is not attained while that of ReLU-NMD is. We also consider another alternative model, called 3B-ReLU-NMD, which parameterizes $\Theta=WH$, where $W$ has $r$ columns and $H$ has $r$ rows, allowing one to get rid of the rank constraint in Latent-ReLU-NMD. Our second contribution is to prove the convergence of a block coordinate descent (BCD) applied to 3B-ReLU-NMD and referred to as BCD-NMD. Our third contribution is a novel extrapolated variant of BCD-NMD, dubbed eBCD-NMD, which we prove is also convergent under mild assumptions. We illustrate the significant acceleration effect of eBCD-NMD compared to BCD-NMD, and also show that eBCD-NMD performs well against the state of the art on synthetic and real-world data sets.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient and Personalized Federated Foundation Model Fine-Tuning via Tri-Matrix Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In federated learning, fine-tuning pre-trained foundation models poses significant challenges, particularly regarding high communication cost and suboptimal model performance due to data heterogeneity between the clients. To address these issues, this paper introduces communication-efficient federated LoRA adaption (CE-LoRA), a method that employs a tri-factorization low-rank adaptation approach with personalized model parameter aggregation. We first presents a novel LoRA parameter factorization by introducing a small-size dense matrix, which can significantly reduce the communication cost and achieve comparable empirical performance than transferring the low-rank parameter matrix used by existing methods. Without violating data privacy, the server considers the client similarity in both training dataset and model parameter space, and learns personalized weights for model aggregation. Our experiments on various LLM and VLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that CE-LoRA not only significantly reduces communication overhead but also improves performance under not independently and identically distributed data conditions. In addition, CE-LoRA improves data privacy protection, effectively mitigating gradient-based data reconstruction attacks.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Comprehensive Gear Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Multi-Scale Feature-Level Fusion Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To satisfy the requirements of the end-to-end fault diagnosis of gears, an integrated intelligent method of fault diagnosis for gears using acceleration signals was proposed, which was based on Gabor-based Adaptive Short-Time Fourier Transform (Gabor-ASTFT) and Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform(DTCWT) algorithms, Dilated Residual structure and feature fusion layer, is proposed in this paper. Initially, the raw one-dimensional acceleration signals collected from the gearbox base using vibration sensors undergo pre-segmentation processing. The Gabor-ASTFT and DTCWT are then applied to convert the original one-dimensional time-domain signals into two-dimensional time-frequency representations, facilitating the preliminary extraction of fault features and obtaining weak feature maps.Subsequently, a dual-channel structure is established using deconvolution and dilated convolution to perform upsampling and downsampling on the feature maps, adjusting their sizes accordingly. A feature fusion layer is then constructed to integrate the dual-channel features, enabling multi-scale analysis of the extracted fault features.Finally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model incorporating a residual structure is developed to conduct deep feature extraction from the fused feature maps. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a Global Average Pooling(GAP) and a classification function for fault classification. Conducting comparative experiments on different datasets, the proposed method is demonstrated to effectively meet the requirements of end-to-end fault diagnosis for gears.</description>

      <title>DiffScale: Continuous Downscaling and Bias Correction of Subseasonal Wind Speed Forecasts using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewable resources are strongly dependent on local and large-scale weather situations. Skillful subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts -- beyond two weeks and up to two months -- can offer significant socioeconomic advantages to the energy sector. This study aims to enhance wind speed predictions using a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to downscale S2S forecasts of surface wind speed. We propose DiffScale, a diffusion model that super-resolves spatial information for continuous downscaling factors and lead times. Leveraging weather priors as guidance for the generative process of diffusion models, we adopt the perspective of conditional probabilities on sampling super-resolved S2S forecasts. We aim to directly estimate the density associated with the target S2S forecasts at different spatial resolutions and lead times without auto-regression or sequence prediction, resulting in an efficient and flexible model. Synthetic experiments were designed to super-resolve wind speed S2S forecasts from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) from a coarse resolution to a finer resolution of ERA5 reanalysis data, which serves as a high-resolution target. The innovative aspect of DiffScale lies in its flexibility to downscale arbitrary scaling factors, enabling it to generalize across various grid resolutions and lead times -without retraining the model- while correcting model errors, making it a versatile tool for improving S2S wind speed forecasts. We achieve a significant improvement in prediction quality, outperforming baselines up to week 3.</description>

      <title>Green MLOps to Green GenOps: An Empirical Study of Energy Consumption in Discriminative and Generative AI Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an empirical investigation into the energy consumption of Discriminative and Generative AI models within real-world MLOps pipelines. For Discriminative models, we examine various architectures and hyperparameters during training and inference and identify energy-efficient practices. For Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) are assessed, focusing primarily on energy consumption across different model sizes and varying service requests. Our study employs software-based power measurements, ensuring ease of replication across diverse configurations, models, and datasets. We analyse multiple models and hardware setups to uncover correlations among various metrics, identifying key contributors to energy consumption. The results indicate that for Discriminative models, optimising architectures, hyperparameters, and hardware can significantly reduce energy consumption without sacrificing performance. For LLMs, energy efficiency depends on balancing model size, reasoning complexity, and request-handling capacity, as larger models do not necessarily consume more energy when utilisation remains low. This analysis provides practical guidelines for designing green and sustainable ML operations, emphasising energy consumption and carbon footprint reductions while maintaining performance. This paper can serve as a benchmark for accurately estimating total energy use across different types of AI models.</description>

      <title>Noise-based reward-modulated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to significant improvements in task performance. However, training neural networks in an RL regime is typically achieved in combination with backpropagation, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments or when using non-differentiable neural networks. While noise-based alternatives like reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL) have been proposed, their performance has remained limited, especially in scenarios with delayed rewards, which require retrospective credit assignment over time. Here, we derive a novel noise-based learning rule that addresses these challenges. Our approach combines directional derivative theory with Hebbian-like updates to enable efficient, gradient-free learning in RL. It features stochastic noisy neurons which can approximate gradients, and produces local synaptic updates modulated by a global reward signal. Drawing on concepts from neuroscience, our method uses reward prediction error as its optimization target to generate increasingly advantageous behavior, and incorporates an eligibility trace to facilitate temporal credit assignment in environments with delayed rewards. Its formulation relies on local information alone, making it compatible with implementations in neuromorphic hardware. Experimental validation shows that our approach significantly outperforms RMHL and is competitive with BP-based baselines, highlighting the promise of noise-based, biologically inspired learning for low-power and real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Federated Structured Sparse PCA for Anomaly Detection in IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although federated learning has gained prominence as a privacy-preserving framework tailored for distributed Internet of Things (IoT) environments, current federated principal component analysis (PCA) methods lack integration of sparsity, a critical feature for robust anomaly detection. To address this limitation, we propose a novel federated structured sparse PCA (FedSSP) approach for anomaly detection in IoT networks. The proposed model uniquely integrates double sparsity regularization: (1) row-wise sparsity governed by $\ell_{2,p}$-norm with $p\in[0,1)$ to eliminate redundant feature dimensions, and (2) element-wise sparsity via $\ell_{q}$-norm with $q\in[0,1)$ to suppress noise-sensitive components. To efficiently solve this non-convex optimization problem in a distributed setting, we devise a proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm with rigorous theoretical proofs establishing its convergence guarantees. Experiments on real datasets validate that incorporating structured sparsity enhances both model interpretability and detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Key-Value Cache Compression Techniques for Large Language Model Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key-Value cache (\texttt{KV} \texttt{cache}) compression has emerged as a promising technique to optimize Large Language Model (LLM) serving. It primarily decreases the memory consumption of \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} to reduce the computation cost. Despite the development of many compression algorithms, their applications in production environments are still not prevalent. In this paper, we revisit mainstream \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression solutions from a practical perspective. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we comprehensively review existing algorithmic designs and benchmark studies for \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression and identify missing pieces in their performance measurement, which could hinder their adoption in practice. Second, we empirically evaluate representative \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression methods to uncover two key issues that affect the computational efficiency: (1) while compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} can reduce memory consumption, current implementations (e.g., FlashAttention, PagedAttention) do not optimize for production-level LLM serving, resulting in suboptimal throughput performance; (2) compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} may lead to longer outputs, resulting in increased end-to-end latency. We further investigate the accuracy performance of individual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic limitations in \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression when handling specific LLM tasks. Third, we provide tools to shed light on future \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression studies and facilitate their practical deployment in production. They are open-sourced in \href{https://github.com/LLMkvsys/rethink-kv-compression}{https://github.com/LLMkvsys/rethink-kv-compression}.</description>

      <title>CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariates play an indispensable role in practical time series forecasting, offering rich context from the past and sometimes extending into the future. However, their availability varies depending on the scenario, and situations often involve multiple target variables simultaneously. Moreover, the cross-variate dependencies between them are multi-granular, with some covariates having a short-term impact on target variables and others showing long-term correlations. This heterogeneity and the intricate dependencies arising in covariate-informed forecasting present significant challenges to existing deep models. To address these issues, we propose CITRAS, a patch-based Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets and covariates covering both the past and the future forecasting horizon. While preserving the strong autoregressive capabilities of the canonical Transformer, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future known covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing transforms locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covariate-informed and multivariate forecasting, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate dependency for improved forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <title>Tree-Guided $L_1$-Convex Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex clustering is a modern clustering framework that guarantees globally optimal solutions and performs comparably to other advanced clustering methods. However, obtaining a complete dendrogram (clusterpath) for large-scale datasets remains computationally challenging due to the extensive costs associated with iterative optimization approaches. To address this limitation, we develop a novel convex clustering algorithm called Tree-Guided $L_1$-Convex Clustering (TGCC). We first focus on the fact that the loss function of $L_1$-convex clustering with tree-structured weights can be efficiently optimized using a dynamic programming approach. We then develop an efficient cluster fusion algorithm that utilizes the tree structure of the weights to accelerate the optimization process and eliminate the issue of cluster splits commonly observed in convex clustering. By combining the dynamic programming approach with the cluster fusion algorithm, the TGCC algorithm achieves superior computational efficiency without sacrificing clustering performance. Remarkably, our TGCC algorithm can construct a complete clusterpath for $10^6$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ within 15 seconds on a standard laptop without the need for parallel or distributed computing frameworks. Moreover, we extend the TGCC algorithm to develop biclustering and sparse convex clustering algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Predictive Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an influential theory of information processing in the brain, providing a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. It is motivated in terms of Bayesian inference, as hidden states and parameters are optimised via gradient descent on variational free energy. However, implementations of PC rely on maximum \textit{a posteriori} (MAP) estimates of hidden states and maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of parameters, limiting their ability to quantify epistemic uncertainty. In this work, we investigate a Bayesian extension to PC that estimates a posterior distribution over network parameters. This approach, termed Bayesian Predictive coding (BPC), preserves the locality of PC and results in closed-form Hebbian weight updates. Compared to PC, our BPC algorithm converges in fewer epochs in the full-batch setting and remains competitive in the mini-batch setting. Additionally, we demonstrate that BPC offers uncertainty quantification comparable to existing methods in Bayesian deep learning, while also improving convergence properties. Together, these results suggest that BPC provides a biologically plausible method for Bayesian learning in the brain, as well as an attractive approach to uncertainty quantification in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Aware Attention-LSTM for PM$_{2.5}$ Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the accuracy and robustness of PM$_{2.5}$ concentration forecasting, this paper introduces FALNet, a Frequency-Aware LSTM Network that integrates frequency-domain decomposition, temporal modeling, and attention-based refinement. The model first applies STL and FFT to extract trend, seasonal, and denoised residual components, effectively filtering out high-frequency noise. The filtered residuals are then fed into a stacked LSTM to capture long-term dependencies, followed by a multi-head attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on key time steps. Experiments conducted on real-world urban air quality datasets demonstrate that FALNet consistently outperforms conventional models across standard metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. The model shows strong adaptability in capturing sharp fluctuations during pollution peaks and non-stationary conditions. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of FALNet for real-time air pollution prediction, environmental risk assessment, and decision-making support.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Airfoil Design Using Neural Network Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, prediction of airfoil shape from targeted pressure distribution (suction and pressure sides) and vice versa is demonstrated using both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) techniques. The dataset is generated for 1600 airfoil shapes, with simulations carried out at Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 10,000 and 90,00,000 and angles of attack (AoA) ranging from 0 to 15 degrees, ensuring the dataset captured diverse aerodynamic conditions. Five different CNN and DNN models are developed depending on the input/output parameters. Results demonstrate that the refined models exhibit improved efficiency, with the DNN model achieving a multi-fold reduction in training time compared to the CNN model for complex datasets consisting of varying airfoil, Re, and AoA. The predicted airfoil shapes/pressure distribution closely match the targeted values, validating the effectiveness of deep learning frameworks. However, the performance of CNN models is found to be better compared to DNN models. Lastly, a flying wing aircraft model of wingspan &gt;10 m is considered for the prediction of pressure distribution along the chordwise. The proposed CNN and DNN models show promising results. This research underscores the potential of deep learning models accelerating aerodynamic optimization and advancing the design of high-performance airfoils.</description>

      <title>TransMamba: Flexibly Switching between Transformer and Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers are the cornerstone of modern large language models, but their quadratic computational complexity limits efficiency in long-sequence processing. Recent advancements in Mamba, a state space model (SSM) with linear complexity, offer promising efficiency gains but suffer from unstable contextual learning and multitask generalization. This paper proposes TransMamba, a novel framework that unifies Transformer and Mamba through shared parameter matrices (e.g., QKV and CBx), and thus could dynamically switch between attention and SSM mechanisms at different token lengths and layers. We design the Memory converter to bridge Transformer and Mamba by converting attention outputs into SSM-compatible states, ensuring seamless information flow at TransPoints where the transformation happens. The TransPoint scheduling is also thoroughly explored for further improvements. We conducted extensive experiments demonstrating that TransMamba achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to baselines, and validated the deeper consistency between Transformer and Mamba paradigms, offering a scalable solution for next-generation sequence modeling.</description>

      <title>Level the Level: Balancing Game Levels for Asymmetric Player Archetypes With Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing games, especially those with asymmetric multiplayer content, requires significant manual effort and extensive human playtesting during development. For this reason, this work focuses on generating balanced levels tailored to asymmetric player archetypes, where the disparity in abilities is balanced entirely through the level design. For instance, while one archetype may have an advantage over another, both should have an equal chance of winning. We therefore conceptualize game balancing as a procedural content generation problem and build on and extend a recently introduced method that uses reinforcement learning to balance tile-based game levels. We evaluate the method on four different player archetypes and demonstrate its ability to balance a larger proportion of levels compared to two baseline approaches. Furthermore, our results indicate that as the disparity between player archetypes increases, the required number of training steps grows, while the model's accuracy in achieving balance decreases.</description>

      <title>CTSketch: Compositional Tensor Sketching for Scalable Neurosymbolic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many computational tasks benefit from being formulated as the composition of neural networks followed by a discrete symbolic program. The goal of neurosymbolic learning is to train the neural networks using only end-to-end input-output labels of the composite. We introduce CTSketch, a novel, scalable neurosymbolic learning algorithm. CTSketch uses two techniques to improve the scalability of neurosymbolic inference: decompose the symbolic program into sub-programs and summarize each sub-program with a sketched tensor. This strategy allows us to approximate the output distribution of the program with simple tensor operations over the input distributions and summaries. We provide theoretical insight into the maximum error of the approximation. Furthermore, we evaluate CTSketch on many benchmarks from the neurosymbolic literature, including some designed for evaluating scalability. Our results show that CTSketch pushes neurosymbolic learning to new scales that have previously been unattainable by obtaining high accuracy on tasks involving over one thousand inputs.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Safe Autonomous Two Device Navigation of Cerebral Vessels in Mechanical Thrombectomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Autonomous systems in mechanical thrombectomy (MT) hold promise for reducing procedure times, minimizing radiation exposure, and enhancing patient safety. However, current reinforcement learning (RL) methods only reach the carotid arteries, are not generalizable to other patient vasculatures, and do not consider safety. We propose a safe dual-device RL algorithm that can navigate beyond the carotid arteries to cerebral vessels.
  Methods: We used the Simulation Open Framework Architecture to represent the intricacies of cerebral vessels, and a modified Soft Actor-Critic RL algorithm to learn, for the first time, the navigation of micro-catheters and micro-guidewires. We incorporate patient safety metrics into our reward function by integrating guidewire tip forces. Inverse RL is used with demonstrator data on 12 patient-specific vascular cases.
  Results: Our simulation demonstrates successful autonomous navigation within unseen cerebral vessels, achieving a 96% success rate, 7.0s procedure time, and 0.24 N mean forces, well below the proposed 1.5 N vessel rupture threshold.
  Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, our proposed autonomous system for MT two-device navigation reaches cerebral vessels, considers safety, and is generalizable to unseen patient-specific cases for the first time. We envisage future work will extend the validation to vasculatures of different complexity and on in vitro models. While our contributions pave the way towards deploying agents in clinical settings, safety and trustworthiness will be crucial elements to consider when proposing new methodology.</description>

      <title>Learning a Canonical Basis of Human Preferences from Binary Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have been driven by alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). RLHF and related techniques typically involve constructing a dataset of binary or ranked choice human preferences and subsequently fine-tuning models to align with these preferences. This paper shifts the focus to understanding the preferences encoded in such datasets and identifying common human preferences. We find that a small subset of 21 preference categories (selected from a set of nearly 5,000 distinct preferences) captures &gt;89% of preference variation across individuals. This small set of preferences is analogous to a canonical basis of human preferences, similar to established findings that characterize human variation in psychology or facial recognition studies. Through both synthetic and empirical evaluations, we confirm that our low-rank, canonical set of human preferences generalizes across the entire dataset and within specific topics. We further demonstrate our preference basis' utility in model evaluation, where our preference categories offer deeper insights into model alignment, and in model training, where we show that fine-tuning on preference-defined subsets successfully aligns the model accordingly.</description>

      <title>LLM4FS: Leveraging Large Language Models for Feature Selection and How to Improve It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have provided new opportunities for decision-making, particularly in the task of automated feature selection. In this paper, we first comprehensively evaluate LLM-based feature selection methods, covering the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1, GPT-o3-mini, and GPT-4.5. Then, we propose a novel hybrid strategy called LLM4FS that integrates LLMs with traditional data-driven methods. Specifically, input data samples into LLMs, and directly call traditional data-driven techniques such as random forest and forward sequential selection. Notably, our analysis reveals that the hybrid strategy leverages the contextual understanding of LLMs and the high statistical reliability of traditional data-driven methods to achieve excellent feature selection performance, even surpassing LLMs and traditional data-driven methods. Finally, we point out the limitations of its application in decision-making.</description>

      <title>Predicting Targeted Therapy Resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using Multimodal Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer death globally, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) emerging as its most prevalent subtype. Among NSCLC patients, approximately 32.3% have mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC patients with activating and T790M resistance EGFR mutations. Despite its established efficacy, drug resistance poses a significant challenge for patients to fully benefit from osimertinib. The absence of a standard tool to accurately predict TKI resistance, including that of osimertinib, remains a critical obstacle. To bridge this gap, in this study, we developed an interpretable multimodal machine learning model designed to predict patient resistance to osimertinib among late-stage NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations, achieving a c-index of 0.82 on a multi-institutional dataset. This machine learning model harnesses readily available data routinely collected during patient visits and medical assessments to facilitate precision lung cancer management and informed treatment decisions. By integrating various data types such as histology images, next generation sequencing (NGS) data, demographics data, and clinical records, our multimodal model can generate well-informed recommendations. Our experiment results also demonstrated the superior performance of the multimodal model over single modality models (c-index 0.82 compared with 0.75 and 0.77), thus underscoring the benefit of combining multiple modalities in patient outcome prediction.</description>

      <title>Ride-Sourcing Vehicle Rebalancing with Service Accessibility Guarantees via Constrained Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of ride-sourcing services such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi Chuxing has fundamentally reshaped urban transportation by offering flexible, on-demand mobility via mobile applications. Despite their convenience, these platforms confront significant operational challenges, particularly vehicle rebalancing - the strategic repositioning of thousands of vehicles to address spatiotemporal mismatches in supply and demand. Inadequate rebalancing results in prolonged rider waiting times, inefficient vehicle utilization, and inequitable distribution of services, leading to disparities in driver availability and income.
  To tackle these complexities, we introduce scalable continuous-state mean-field control (MFC) and reinforcement learning (MFRL) models that explicitly represent each vehicle's precise location and employ continuous repositioning actions guided by the distribution of other vehicles. To ensure equitable service distribution, an accessibility constraint is integrated within our optimal control formulation, balancing operational efficiency with equitable access to the service across geographic regions. Our approach acknowledges realistic conditions, including inherent stochasticity in transitions, the simultaneous occurrence of vehicle-rider matching, vehicles' rebalancing and cruising, and variability in rider behaviors. Crucially, we relax the traditional mean-field assumption of equal supply-demand volume, better reflecting practical scenarios. Extensive empirical evaluation using real-world data-driven simulation of Shenzhen demonstrates the real-time efficiency and robustness of our approach at the scale of tens of thousands of vehicles.

      <title>NeuRaLaTeX: A machine learning library written in pure LaTeX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce NeuRaLaTeX, which we believe to be the first deep learning library written entirely in LaTeX. As part of your LaTeX document you can specify the architecture of a neural network and its loss functions, define how to generate or load training data, and specify training hyperparameters and experiments. When the document is compiled, the LaTeX compiler will generate or load training data, train the network, run experiments, and generate figures. This paper generates a random 100 point spiral dataset, trains a two layer MLP on it, evaluates on a different random spiral dataset, produces plots and tables of results. The paper took 48 hours to compile and the entire source code for NeuRaLaTeX is contained within the source code of the paper. We propose two new metrics: the Written In Latex (WIL) metric measures the proportion of a machine learning library that is written in pure LaTeX, while the Source Code Of Method in Source Code of Paper (SCOMISCOP) metric measures the proportion of a paper's implementation that is contained within the paper source. We are state-of-the-art for both metrics, outperforming the ResNet and Transformer papers, as well as the PyTorch and Tensorflow libraries. Source code, documentation, videos, crypto scams and an invitation to invest in the commercialisation of NeuRaLaTeX are available at https://www.neuralatex.com</description>

      <title>Many-to-Many Matching via Sparsity Controlled Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-to-many matching seeks to match multiple points in one set and multiple points in another set, which is a basis for a wide range of data mining problems. It can be naturally recast in the framework of Optimal Transport (OT). However, existing OT methods either lack the ability to accomplish many-to-many matching or necessitate careful tuning of a regularization parameter to achieve satisfactory results. This paper proposes a novel many-to-many matching method to explicitly encode many-to-many constraints while preventing the degeneration into one-to-one matching. The proposed method consists of the following two components. The first component is the matching budget constraints on each row and column of a transport plan, which specify how many points can be matched to a point at most. The second component is the deformed $q$-entropy regularization, which encourages a point to meet the matching budget maximally. While the deformed $q$-entropy was initially proposed to sparsify a transport plan, we employ it to avoid the degeneration into one-to-one matching. We optimize the objective via a penalty algorithm, which is efficient and theoretically guaranteed to converge. Experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good performance by gleaning meaningful many-to-many matchings.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Prediction of Fine-Grained Origin-Destination Matrices with Applications in Ridesharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate spatial-temporal prediction of network-based travelers' requests is crucial for the effective policy design of ridesharing platforms. Having knowledge of the total demand between various locations in the upcoming time slots enables platforms to proactively prepare adequate supplies, thereby increasing the likelihood of fulfilling travelers' requests and redistributing idle drivers to areas with high potential demand to optimize the global supply-demand equilibrium. This paper delves into the prediction of Origin-Destination (OD) demands at a fine-grained spatial level, especially when confronted with an expansive set of local regions. While this task holds immense practical value, it remains relatively unexplored within the research community. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel prediction model called OD-CED, which comprises an unsupervised space coarsening technique to alleviate data sparsity and an encoder-decoder architecture to capture both semantic and geographic dependencies. Through practical experimentation, OD-CED has demonstrated remarkable results. It achieved an impressive reduction of up to 45% reduction in root-mean-square error and 60% in weighted mean absolute percentage error over traditional statistical methods when dealing with OD matrices exhibiting a sparsity exceeding 90%.</description>

      <title>Advances in Continual Graph Learning for Anti-Money Laundering Systems: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial institutions are required by regulation to report suspicious financial transactions related to money laundering. Therefore, they need to constantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. A particular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers continuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods need constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning methods may address this issue and enhance current anti-money laundering (AML) practices, by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining prior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is still scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual graph learning approaches for AML applications. We categorise methods into replay-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based strategies within the graph neural network (GNN) framework, and we provide in-depth experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world AML data sets that showcase the effect of the different hyperparameters. Our analysis demonstrates that continual learning improves model adaptability and robustness in the face of extreme class imbalances and evolving fraud patterns. Finally, we outline key challenges and propose directions for future research.</description>

      <title>New Statistical Framework for Extreme Error Probability in High-Stakes Domains for Reliable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is vital in high-stakes domains, yet conventional validation methods rely on averaging metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE), which fail to quantify extreme errors. Worst-case prediction failures can have substantial consequences, but current frameworks lack statistical foundations for assessing their probability. In this work a new statistical framework, based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT), is presented that provides a rigorous approach to estimating worst-case failures. Applying EVT to synthetic and real-world datasets, this method is shown to enable robust estimation of catastrophic failure probabilities, overcoming the fundamental limitations of standard cross-validation. This work establishes EVT as a fundamental tool for assessing model reliability, ensuring safer AI deployment in new technologies where uncertainty quantification is central to decision-making or scientific analysis.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Designing Sparse Autoencoders by Approximating Quasi-Orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a workhorse of modern mechanistic interpretability, but leading SAE approaches with top-$k$ style activation functions lack theoretical grounding for selecting the hyperparameter $k$. SAEs are based on the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which assumes that the representations of large language models (LLMs) are linearly encoded, and the superposition hypothesis (SH), which states that there can be more features in the model than its dimensionality. We show that, based on the formal definitions of the LRH and SH, the magnitude of sparse feature vectors (the latent representations learned by SAEs of the dense embeddings of LLMs) can be approximated using their corresponding dense vector with a closed-form error bound. To visualize this, we propose the ZF plot, which reveals a previously unknown relationship between LLM hidden embeddings and SAE feature vectors, allowing us to make the first empirical measurement of the extent to which feature vectors of pre-trained SAEs are over- or under-activated for a given input. Correspondingly, we introduce Approximate Feature Activation (AFA), which approximates the magnitude of the ground-truth sparse feature vector, and propose a new evaluation metric derived from AFA to assess the alignment between inputs and activations. We also leverage AFA to introduce a novel SAE architecture, the top-AFA SAE, leading to SAEs that: (a) are more in line with theoretical justifications; and (b) obviate the need to tune SAE sparsity hyperparameters. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that top-AFA SAEs achieve reconstruction loss comparable to that of state-of-the-art top-k SAEs, without requiring the hyperparameter $k$ to be tuned.

      <title>Value of Information-based Deceptive Path Planning Under Adversarial Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for deceptive path planning (DPP) address the problem of designing paths that conceal their true goal from a passive, external observer. Such methods do not apply to problems where the observer has the ability to perform adversarial interventions to impede the path planning agent. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov decision process (MDP)-based model for the DPP problem under adversarial interventions and develop new value of information (VoI) objectives to guide the design of DPP policies. Using the VoI objectives we propose, path planning agents deceive the adversarial observer into choosing suboptimal interventions by selecting trajectories that are of low informational value to the observer. Leveraging connections to the linear programming theory for MDPs, we derive computationally efficient solution methods for synthesizing policies for performing DPP under adversarial interventions. In our experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution method in achieving deceptiveness under adversarial interventions and demonstrate the superior performance of our approach to both existing DPP methods and conservative path planning approaches on illustrative gridworld problems.</description>

      <title>Open-Reasoner-Zero: An Open Source Approach to Scaling Up Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Open-Reasoner-Zero, the first open source implementation of large-scale reasoning-oriented RL training focusing on scalability, simplicity and accessibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a minimalist approach, vanilla PPO with GAE ($\lambda=1$, $\gamma=1$) and straightforward rule-based rewards, without any KL regularization, is sufficient to scale up both response length and benchmark performance, similar to the phenomenon observed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Using the same base model as DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B, our implementation achieves superior performance on AIME2024, MATH500, and the GPQA Diamond benchmark while demonstrating remarkable efficiency -- requiring only a tenth of the training steps, compared to DeepSeek-R1-Zero pipeline. In the spirit of open source, we release our source code, parameter settings, training data, and model weights across various sizes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating machine learning models for predicting pesticides toxicity to honey bees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small molecules play a critical role in the biomedical, environmental, and agrochemical domains, each with distinct physicochemical requirements and success criteria. Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (\textit{Apis mellifera}), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.</description>

      <title>NoProp: Training Neural Networks without Back-propagation or Forward-propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical deep learning approach for learning requires computing a gradient term at each layer by back-propagating the error signal from the output towards each learnable parameter. Given the stacked structure of neural networks, where each layer builds on the representation of the layer below, this approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features live on the top layers of the model, while features on lower layers are expected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning method named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards propagation. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, where each layer independently learns to denoise a noisy target. We believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of gradient-free learning methods, that does not learn hierarchical representations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the representation at each layer beforehand to a noised version of the target, learning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable learning algorithm which achieves superior accuracy, is easier to use and computationally more efficient compared to other existing back-propagation-free methods. By departing from the traditional gradient based learning paradigm, NoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more efficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other characteristics of the learning process.</description>

      <title>ORAL: Prompting Your Large-Scale LoRAs via Conditional Recurrent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter generation has emerged as a novel paradigm for neural network development, offering an alternative to traditional neural network training by synthesizing high-quality model weights directly. In the context of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for evolving ($\textit{i.e.}$, constantly updated) large language models (LLMs), this approach promises efficient adaptation without costly retraining. However, existing methods face critical limitations in simultaneously achieving scalability and controllability. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{ORAL}$, a novel $\textbf{conditional recurrent diffusion}$ framework that addresses these challenges. $\texttt{ORAL}$ incorporates a novel conditioning mechanism that integrates model architecture and textual task specifications, enabling the generation of task-specific LoRA parameters that can seamlessly transfer across evolving foundation models. Our approach successfully scales to billions-of-parameter LLMs and maintains controllability. Through extensive experiments across seven language tasks, four vision tasks, and three multimodal tasks using five pre-trained LLMs, we demonstrate that $\texttt{ORAL}$ generates high-quality LoRA parameters that achieve comparable or superior performance to vanilla trained counterparts.</description>

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Which LIME should I trust? Concepts, Challenges, and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As neural networks become dominant in essential systems, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in fostering trust and detecting potential misbehavior of opaque models. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is among the most prominent model-agnostic approaches, generating explanations by approximating the behavior of black-box models around specific instances. Despite its popularity, LIME faces challenges related to fidelity, stability, and applicability to domain-specific problems. Numerous adaptations and enhancements have been proposed to address these issues, but the growing number of developments can be overwhelming, complicating efforts to navigate LIME-related research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to comprehensively explore and collect LIME's foundational concepts and known limitations. We categorize and compare its various enhancements, offering a structured taxonomy based on intermediate steps and key issues. Our analysis provides a holistic overview of advancements in LIME, guiding future research and helping practitioners identify suitable approaches. Additionally, we provide a continuously updated interactive website (https://patrick-knab.github.io/which-lime-to-trust/), offering a concise and accessible overview of the survey.</description>

      <title>Effectively Controlling Reasoning Models through Thinking Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating final answers, helping the model excel in complex problem-solving. In this paper, we demonstrate that this emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained control over model behavior. We propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks, including instruction following on IFEval, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on XSTest and SORRY-Bench. Our results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7% accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, our work opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs.</description>

      <title>Prompt, Divide, and Conquer: Bypassing Large Language Model Safety Filters via Segmented and Distributed Prompt Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed task automation and content generation across various domains while incorporating safety filters to prevent misuse. We introduce a novel jailbreaking framework that employs distributed prompt processing combined with iterative refinements to bypass these safety measures, particularly in generating malicious code. Our architecture consists of four key modules: prompt segmentation, parallel processing, response aggregation, and LLM-based jury evaluation. Tested on 500 malicious prompts across 10 cybersecurity categories, the framework achieves a 73.2% Success Rate (SR) in generating malicious code. Notably, our comparative analysis reveals that traditional single-LLM judge evaluation overestimates SRs (93.8%) compared to our LLM jury system (73.2%), with manual verification confirming that single-judge assessments often accept incomplete implementations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our distributed architecture improves SRs by 12% over the non-distributed approach in an ablation study, highlighting both the effectiveness of distributed prompt processing and the importance of robust evaluation methodologies in assessing jailbreak attempts.</description>

      <title>Truth in Text: A Meta-Analysis of ML-Based Cyber Information Influence Detection Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber information influence, or disinformation in general terms, is widely regarded as one of the biggest threats to social progress and government stability. From US presidential elections to European Union referendums and down to regional news reporting of wildfires, lies and post-truths have normalized radical decision-making. Accordingly, there has been an explosion in research seeking to detect disinformation in online media. The frontier of disinformation detection research is leveraging a variety of ML techniques such as traditional ML algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Na\"ive Bayes. Other research has applied deep learning models including Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks, and transformer-based architectures. Despite the overall success of such techniques, the literature demonstrates inconsistencies when viewed holistically which limits our understanding of the true effectiveness. Accordingly, this work employed a two-stage meta-analysis to (a) demonstrate an overall meta statistic for ML model effectiveness in detecting disinformation and (b) investigate the same by subgroups of ML model types. The study found the majority of the 81 ML detection techniques sampled have greater than an 80\% accuracy with a Mean sample effectiveness of 79.18\% accuracy. Meanwhile, subgroups demonstrated no statistically significant difference between-approaches but revealed high within-group variance. Based on the results, this work recommends future work in replication and development of detection methods operating at the ML model level.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Aviation Communication Transcription: Fine-Tuning Distil-Whisper with LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcription of aviation communications has several applications, from assisting air traffic controllers in identifying the accuracy of read-back errors to search and rescue operations. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have provided unprecedented opportunities for improving aviation communication transcription tasks. OpenAI's Whisper is one of the leading automatic speech recognition models. However, fine-tuning Whisper for aviation communication transcription is not computationally efficient. Thus, this paper aims to use a Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning method called Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune a more computationally efficient version of Whisper, distil-Whisper. To perform the fine-tuning, we used the Air Traffic Control Corpus dataset from the Linguistic Data Consortium, which contains approximately 70 hours of controller and pilot transmissions near three major airports in the US. The objective was to reduce the word error rate to enhance accuracy in the transcription of aviation communication. First, starting with an initial set of hyperparameters for LoRA (Alpha = 64 and Rank = 32), we performed a grid search. We applied a 5-fold cross-validation to find the best combination of distil-Whisper hyperparameters. Then, we fine-tuned the model for LoRA hyperparameters, achieving an impressive average word error rate of 3.86% across five folds. This result highlights the model's potential for use in the cockpit.</description>

      <title>Modeling speech emotion with label variance and analyzing performance across speakers and unseen acoustic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous speech emotion data usually contain perceptual grades where graders assign emotion score after listening to the speech files. Such perceptual grades introduce uncertainty in labels due to grader opinion variation. Grader variation is addressed by using consensus grades as groundtruth, where the emotion with the highest vote is selected. Consensus grades fail to consider ambiguous instances where a speech sample may contain multiple emotions, as captured through grader opinion uncertainty. We demonstrate that using the probability density function of the emotion grades as targets instead of the commonly used consensus grades, provide better performance on benchmark evaluation sets compared to results reported in the literature. We show that a saliency driven foundation model (FM) representation selection helps to train a state-of-the-art speech emotion model for both dimensional and categorical emotion recognition. Comparing representations obtained from different FMs, we observed that focusing on overall test-set performance can be deceiving, as it fails to reveal the models generalization capacity across speakers and gender. We demonstrate that performance evaluation across multiple test-sets and performance analysis across gender and speakers are useful in assessing usefulness of emotion models. Finally, we demonstrate that label uncertainty and data-skew pose a challenge to model evaluation, where instead of using the best hypothesis, it is useful to consider the 2- or 3-best hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Risk-Calibrated Affective Speech Recognition via Conformal Coverage Guarantees: A Stochastic Calibrative Framework for Emergent Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic safety challenges arising from extreme driver emotions highlight the urgent need for reliable emotion recognition systems. Traditional deep learning approaches in speech emotion recognition suffer from overfitting and poorly calibrated confidence estimates. We propose a framework integrating Conformal Prediction (CP) and Risk Control,using Mel-spectrogram features processed through a pre-trained convolutional neural network. Our key innovation is the development of a nonconformity score that heuristically measures how closely a classifier's predictions align with given inputs. Through calibration samples, we compute this score and derive a statistically rigorous threshold based on user-specified risk level $\alpha$, constructing prediction sets with provable coverage guarantees ($\geq 1-\alpha$). The Risk Control framework enables task-specific adaptation through customizable loss functions, dynamically adjusting prediction set sizes while maintaining coverage guarantees. Cross-dataset experiments on IEMOCAP and TESS demonstrate: 1) Strict coverage guarantee, 2) Significant negative correlation between Average Prediction Set Size (APSS) and $\alpha$, revealing reduced model uncertainty under high-risk conditions. We further propose APSS as a novel metric for evaluating classification uncertainty. This approach enhances speech emotion recognition reliability, with direct applications in intelligent transportation systems and real-time emotion monitoring.</description>

      <title>Chirp Localization via Fine-Tuned Transformer Model: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectrograms are pivotal in time-frequency signal analysis, widely used in audio processing and computational neuroscience. Chirp-like patterns in electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrograms (marked by linear or exponential frequency sweep) are key biomarkers for seizure dynamics, but automated tools for their detection, localization, and feature extraction are lacking. This study bridges this gap by fine-tuning a Vision Transformer (ViT) model on synthetic spectrograms, augmented with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to boost adaptability. We generated 100000 synthetic spectrograms with chirp parameters, creating the first large-scale benchmark for chirp localization. These spectrograms mimic neural chirps using linear or exponential frequency sweep, Gaussian noise, and smoothing. A ViT model, adapted for regression, predicted chirp parameters. LoRA fine-tuned the attention layers, enabling efficient updates to the pre-trained backbone. Training used MSE loss and the AdamW optimizer, with a learning rate scheduler and early stopping to curb overfitting. Only three features were targeted: Chirp Start Time (Onset Time), Chirp Start Frequency (Onset Frequency), and Chirp End Frequency (Offset Frequency). Performance was evaluated via Pearson correlation between predicted and actual labels. Results showed strong alignment: 0.9841 correlation for chirp start time, with stable inference times (137 to 140s) and minimal bias in error distributions. This approach offers a tool for chirp analysis in EEG time-frequency representation, filling a critical methodological void.</description>

Abstract: Despite the excitement behind biomedical artificial intelligence (AI), access to high-quality, diverse, and large-scale data - the foundation for modern AI systems - is still a bottleneck to unlocking its full potential. To address this gap, we introduce Biomedica, an open-source dataset derived from the PubMed Central Open Access subset, containing over 6 million scientific articles and 24 million image-text pairs, along with 27 metadata fields (including expert human annotations). To overcome the challenges of accessing our large-scale dataset, we provide scalable streaming and search APIs through a web server, facilitating seamless integration with AI systems. We demonstrate the utility of the Biomedica dataset by building embedding models, chat-style models, and retrieval-augmented chat agents. Notably, all our AI models surpass previous open systems in their respective categories, underscoring the critical role of diverse, high-quality, and large-scale biomedical data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting adsorption properties in nanoporous materials using Deep Learning models remains a challenging task. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when attempting to generalize to structures that were not part of the training data.. In this work, we introduce SymGNN, a graph neural network architecture that leverages material symmetries to improve adsorption property prediction. By incorporating symmetry operations into the message-passing mechanism, our model enhances parameter sharing across different zeolite topologies, leading to improved generalization. We evaluate SymGNN on both interpolation and generalization tasks, demonstrating that it successfully captures key adsorption trends, including the influence of both the framework and aluminium distribution on CO$_2$ adsorption. Furthermore, we apply our model to the characterization of experimental adsorption isotherms, using a genetic algorithm to infer likely aluminium distributions. Our results highlight the effectiveness of machine learning models trained on simulations for studying real materials and suggest promising directions for fine-tuning with experimental data and generative approaches for the inverse design of multifunctional nanomaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their versatility, concept maps are used in various educational settings and serve as tools that enable educators to comprehend students' knowledge construction. An essential component for analyzing a concept map is its structure, which can be categorized into three distinct types: spoke, network, and chain. Understanding the predominant structure in a map offers insights into the student's depth of comprehension of the subject. Therefore, this study examined 317 distinct concept map structures, classifying them into one of the three types, and used statistical and descriptive information from the maps to train multiclass classification models. As a result, we achieved an 86\% accuracy in classification using a Decision Tree. This promising outcome can be employed in concept map assessment systems to provide real-time feedback to the student.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on the limitations about the insufficient fitting capability of current quantum machine learning methods, which results from the over-reliance on a single data embedding strategy. We propose a novel quantum machine learning framework that integrates multiple quantum data embedding strategies, allowing the model to fully exploit the diversity of quantum computing when processing various datasets. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods and achieving superior performance in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Malicious and Unintentional Disclosure Risks in Large Language Models for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the risk that a large language model (LLM) trained for code generation on data mined from software repositories will generate content that discloses sensitive information included in its training data. We decompose this risk, known in the literature as ``unintended memorization,'' into two components: unintentional disclosure (where an LLM presents secrets to users without the user seeking them out) and malicious disclosure (where an LLM presents secrets to an attacker equipped with partial knowledge of the training data). We observe that while existing work mostly anticipates malicious disclosure, unintentional disclosure is also a concern. We describe methods to assess unintentional and malicious disclosure risks side-by-side across different releases of training datasets and models. We demonstrate these methods through an independent assessment of the Open Language Model (OLMo) family of models and its Dolma training datasets. Our results show, first, that changes in data source and processing are associated with substantial changes in unintended memorization risk; second, that the same set of operational changes may increase one risk while mitigating another; and, third, that the risk of disclosing sensitive information varies not only by prompt strategies or test datasets but also by the types of sensitive information. These contributions rely on data mining to enable greater privacy and security testing required for the LLM training data supply chain.</description>

      <title>Boosting Large Language Models with Mask Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model is usually kept integral in the mainstream large language model (LLM) fine-tuning protocols. No works have questioned whether maintaining the integrity of the model is indispensable for performance. In this work, we introduce Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT), a brand-new LLM fine-tuning paradigm to show that properly breaking the integrity of the model can surprisingly lead to improved performance. Specifically, MFT learns a set of binary masks supervised by the typical LLM fine-tuning objective. Extensive experiments show that MFT gains a consistent performance boost across various domains and backbones (e.g., 1.95%/1.88% average gain in coding with LLaMA2-7B/3.1-8B). Detailed procedures are provided to study the proposed MFT from different hyperparameter perspectives for better insight. In particular, MFT naturally updates the current LLM training protocol by deploying it on a complete well-trained model. This study extends the functionality of mask learning from its conventional network pruning context for model compression to a more general scope.</description>

      <title>Congenital Heart Disease Classification Using Phonocardiograms: A Scalable Screening Tool for Diverse Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a critical condition that demands early detection, particularly in infancy and childhood. This study presents a deep learning model designed to detect CHD using phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, with a focus on its application in global health. We evaluated our model on several datasets, including the primary dataset from Bangladesh, achieving a high accuracy of 94.1%, sensitivity of 92.7%, specificity of 96.3%. The model also demonstrated robust performance on the public PhysioNet Challenge 2022 and 2016 datasets, underscoring its generalizability to diverse populations and data sources. We assessed the performance of the algorithm for single and multiple auscultation sites on the chest, demonstrating that the model maintains over 85% accuracy even when using a single location. Furthermore, our algorithm was able to achieve an accuracy of 80% on low-quality recordings, which cardiologists deemed non-diagnostic. This research suggests that an AI- driven digital stethoscope could serve as a cost-effective screening tool for CHD in resource-limited settings, enhancing clinical decision support and ultimately improving patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Mean-variance Team Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a long-run mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where each agent shares a common mean-variance objective for the system and takes actions independently to maximize it. MV-TSG has two main challenges. First, the variance metric is neither additive nor Markovian in a dynamic setting. Second, simultaneous policy updates of all agents lead to a non-stationary environment for each individual agent. Both challenges make dynamic programming inapplicable. In this paper, we study MV-TSGs from the perspective of sensitivity-based optimization. The performance difference and performance derivative formulas for joint policies are derived, which provide optimization information for MV-TSGs. We prove the existence of a deterministic Nash policy for this problem. Subsequently, we propose a Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Policy Iteration (MV-MAPI) algorithm with a sequential update scheme, where individual agent policies are updated one by one in a given order. We prove that the MV-MAPI algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective function. By analyzing the local geometry of stationary points, we derive specific conditions for stationary points to be (local) Nash equilibria, and further, strict local optima. To solve large-scale MV-TSGs in scenarios with unknown environmental parameters, we extend the idea of trust region methods to MV-MAPI and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm named Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization (MV-MATRPO). We derive a performance lower bound for each update of joint policies. Finally, numerical experiments on energy management in multiple microgrid systems are conducted.</description>

      <title>Patronus: Bringing Transparency to Diffusion Models with Prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), have achieved remarkable success in image generation, but their step-by-step denoising process remains opaque, leaving critical aspects of the generation mechanism unexplained. To address this, we introduce \emph{Patronus}, an interpretable diffusion model inspired by ProtoPNet. Patronus integrates a prototypical network into DDPMs, enabling the extraction of prototypes and conditioning of the generation process on their prototype activation vector. This design enhances interpretability by showing the learned prototypes and how they influence the generation process. Additionally, the model supports downstream tasks like image manipulation, enabling more transparent and controlled modifications. Moreover, Patronus could reveal shortcut learning in the generation process by detecting unwanted correlations between learned prototypes. Notably, Patronus operates entirely without any annotations or text prompts. This work opens new avenues for understanding and controlling diffusion models through prototype-based interpretability. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/nina-weng/patronus}{https://github.com/nina-weng/patronus}.</description>

      <title>Quantum Doeblin Coefficients: Interpretations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical information theory, the Doeblin coefficient of a classical channel provides an efficiently computable upper bound on the total-variation contraction coefficient of the channel, leading to what is known as a strong data-processing inequality. Here, we investigate quantum Doeblin coefficients as a generalization of the classical concept. In particular, we define various new quantum Doeblin coefficients, one of which has several desirable properties, including concatenation and multiplicativity, in addition to being efficiently computable. We also develop various interpretations of two of the quantum Doeblin coefficients, including representations as minimal singlet fractions, exclusion values, reverse max-mutual and oveloH informations, reverse robustnesses, and hypothesis testing reverse mutual and oveloH informations. Our interpretations of quantum Doeblin coefficients as either entanglement-assisted or unassisted exclusion values are particularly appealing, indicating that they are proportional to the best possible error probabilities one could achieve in state-exclusion tasks by making use of the channel. We also outline various applications of quantum Doeblin coefficients, ranging from limitations on quantum machine learning algorithms that use parameterized quantum circuits (noise-induced barren plateaus), on error mitigation protocols, on the sample complexity of noisy quantum hypothesis testing, on the fairness of noisy quantum models, and on mixing times of time-varying channels. All of these applications make use of the fact that quantum Doeblin coefficients appear in upper bounds on various trace-distance contraction coefficients of a channel. Furthermore, in all of these applications, our analysis using Doeblin coefficients provides improvements of various kinds over contributions from prior literature, both in terms of generality and being efficiently computable.</description>

      <title>Nonhuman Primate Brain Tissue Segmentation Using a Transfer Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-human primates (NHPs) serve as critical models for understanding human brain function and neurological disorders due to their close evolutionary relationship with humans. Accurate brain tissue segmentation in NHPs is critical for understanding neurological disorders, but challenging due to the scarcity of annotated NHP brain MRI datasets, the small size of the NHP brain, the limited resolution of available imaging data and the anatomical differences between human and NHP brains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach utilizing STU-Net with transfer learning to leverage knowledge transferred from human brain MRI data to enhance segmen-tation accuracy in the NHP brain MRI, particularly when training data is limited.The combination of STU-Net and transfer learning effectively delineates complex tissue boundaries and captures fine anatomical details specific to NHP brains. Notably, our method demonstrated improvement in segmenting small subcortical structures such as putamen and thalamus that are challenging to resolve with limited spatial resolution and tissue contrast, and achieved DSC of over 0.88, IoU over 0.8 and HD95 under 7. This study introduces a robust method for multi-class brain tissue segmentation in NHPs, potentially accelerating research in evolutionary neuroscience and preclinical studies of neurological disorders relevant to human health.</description>

Abstract: Sonar sensing is fundamental for underwater robotics, but limited by capabilities of AI systems, which need large training datasets. Public data in sonar modalities is lacking. This paper presents the Marine Debris Forward-Looking Sonar datasets, with three different settings (watertank, turntable, flooded quarry) increasing dataset diversity and multiple computer vision tasks: object classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, patch matching, and unsupervised learning. We provide full dataset description, basic analysis and initial results for some tasks. We expect the research community will benefit from this dataset, which is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15101686</description>

      <title>Nested Stochastic Gradient Descent for (Generalized) Sinkhorn Distance-Regularized Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is a powerful technique to train robust models against data distribution shift. This paper aims to solve regularized nonconvex DRO problems, where the uncertainty set is modeled by a so-called generalized Sinkhorn distance and the loss function is nonconvex and possibly unbounded. Such a distance allows to model uncertainty of distributions with different probability supports and divergence functions. For this class of regularized DRO problems, we derive a novel dual formulation taking the form of nested stochastic programming, where the dual variable depends on the data sample. To solve the dual problem, we provide theoretical evidence to design a nested stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which leverages stochastic approximation to estimate the nested stochastic gradients. We study the convergence rate of nested SGD and establish polynomial iteration and sample complexities that are independent of the data size and parameter dimension, indicating its potential for solving large-scale DRO problems. We conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Bi-Level Multi-View fuzzy Clustering with Exponential Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose extension of fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering in multi-view environments. First, we introduce an exponential multi-view FCM (E-MVFCM). E-MVFCM is a centralized MVC with consideration to heat-kernel coefficients (H-KC) and weight factors. Secondly, we propose an exponential bi-level multi-view fuzzy c-means clustering (EB-MVFCM). Different to E-MVFCM, EB-MVFCM does automatic computation of feature and weight factors simultaneously. Like E-MVFCM, EB-MVFCM present explicit forms of the H-KC to simplify the generation of the heat-kernel $\mathcal{K}(t)$ in powers of the proper time $t$ during the clustering process. All the features used in this study, including tools and functions of proposed algorithms will be made available at https://www.github.com/KristinaP09/EB-MVFCM.</description>

      <title>Identifying Multi-modal Knowledge Neurons in Pretrained Transformers via Two-stage Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. Although these models allow for integrated visual and language understanding, they present challenges such as opaque internal processing and the generation of hallucinations and misinformation. Therefore, there is a need for a method to clarify the location of knowledge in MLLMs.
  In this study, we propose a method to identify neurons associated with specific knowledge using MiniGPT-4, a Transformer-based MLLM. Specifically, we extract knowledge neurons through two stages: activation differences filtering using inpainting and gradient-based filtering using GradCAM. Experiments on the image caption generation task using the MS COCO 2017 dataset, BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore quantitative evaluation, and qualitative evaluation using an activation heatmap showed that our method is able to locate knowledge with higher accuracy than existing methods.
  This study contributes to the visualization and explainability of knowledge in MLLMs and shows the potential for future knowledge editing and control.</description>

      <title>SUV: Scalable Large Language Model Copyright Compliance with Regularized Selective Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing by learning from massive datasets, yet this rapid progress has also drawn legal scrutiny, as the ability to unintentionally generate copyrighted content has already prompted several prominent lawsuits. In this work, we introduce SUV (Selective Unlearning for Verbatim data), a selective unlearning framework designed to prevent LLM from memorizing copyrighted content while preserving its overall utility. In detail, the proposed method constructs a dataset that captures instances of copyrighted infringement cases by the targeted LLM. With the dataset, we unlearn the content from the LLM by means of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which replaces the verbatim copyrighted content with plausible and coherent alternatives. Since DPO may hinder the LLM's performance in other unrelated tasks, we integrate gradient projection and Fisher information regularization to mitigate the degradation. We validate our approach using a large-scale dataset of 500 famous books (predominantly copyrighted works) and demonstrate that SUV significantly reduces verbatim memorization with negligible impact on the performance on unrelated tasks. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and public benchmarks confirm the scalability and efficacy of our approach, offering a promising solution for mitigating copyright risks in real-world LLM applications.</description>

      <title>XL-Instruct: Synthetic Data for Cross-Lingual Open-Ended Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual open-ended generation -- i.e. generating responses in a desired language different from that of the user's query -- is an important yet understudied problem. We introduce XL-AlpacaEval, a new benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual generation capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), and propose XL-Instruct, a high-quality synthetic data generation method. Fine-tuning with just 8K XL-Instruct-generated instructions significantly improves model performance, increasing the win rate against GPT-4o-Mini from 7.4% to 21.5%, and improving on several fine-grained quality metrics. Additionally, models fine-tuned on XL-Instruct exhibit strong zero-shot transfer to both English-only and multilingual generation tasks. Given its consistent gains across the board, we strongly recommend incorporating XL-Instruct in the post-training pipeline of future multilingual LLMs. To facilitate further research, we will publicly and freely release the XL-Instruct and XL-AlpacaEval datasets, which constitute two of the few cross-lingual resources currently available in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The colonization of Mars presents extraordinary challenges, including radiation exposure, low atmospheric pressure, and toxic regolith. Recent advancements in synthetic biology and genetic engineering offer unprecedented opportunities to address these obstacles by utilizing terrestrial extremophiles and engineered organisms. This paper examines the potential for creating symbiotic relationships between terrestrial microbes and hypothetical Martian life forms, should they exist, to support a sustainable human presence on Mars. Inspired by natural examples of endosymbiosis, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, we propose methods to engineer life forms capable of enduring Martian conditions. Key components include experimental designs, laboratory simulations, and bioengineering approaches essential to this endeavor. The ethical, political, and technological challenges of introducing engineered life to Mars are critically evaluated, with an emphasis on international collaboration and robust planetary protection policies. This research underscores engineered symbiosis as a transformative strategy for enabling life to adapt and thrive on Mars while advancing humanity's aspirations for interplanetary habitation and exploration. By addressing these challenges, this work highlights a path toward sustainable life on Mars, reflecting both scientific ingenuity and ethical stewardship.</description>

      <title>Agentic Large Language Models, a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is great interest in agentic LLMs, large language models that act as agents. We review the growing body of work in this area and provide a research agenda. Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories. We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic LLMs may provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.</description>

      <title>VLM-C4L: Continual Core Dataset Learning with Corner Case Optimization via Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption and deployment of autonomous driving, handling complex environments has become an unavoidable challenge. Due to the scarcity and diversity of extreme scenario datasets, current autonomous driving models struggle to effectively manage corner cases. This limitation poses a significant safety risk, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), autonomous vehicle systems have been involved in hundreds of reported crashes annually in the United States, occurred in corner cases like sun glare and fog, which caused a few fatal accident. Furthermore, in order to consistently maintain a robust and reliable autonomous driving system, it is essential for models not only to perform well on routine scenarios but also to adapt to newly emerging scenarios, especially those corner cases that deviate from the norm. This requires a learning mechanism that incrementally integrates new knowledge without degrading previously acquired capabilities. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing continual learning methods have been proposed to ensure consistent and scalable corner case learning in autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-C4L, a continual learning framework that introduces Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to dynamically optimize and enhance corner case datasets, and VLM-C4L combines VLM-guided high-quality data extraction with a core data replay strategy, enabling the model to incrementally learn from diverse corner cases while preserving performance on previously routine scenarios, thus ensuring long-term stability and adaptability in real-world autonomous driving. We evaluate VLM-C4L on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner case dataset CODA.</description>

      <title>Concorde: Fast and Accurate CPU Performance Modeling with Compositional Analytical-ML Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cycle-level simulators such as gem5 are widely used in microarchitecture design, but they are prohibitively slow for large-scale design space explorations. We present Concorde, a new methodology for learning fast and accurate performance models of microarchitectures. Unlike existing simulators and learning approaches that emulate each instruction, Concorde predicts the behavior of a program based on compact performance distributions that capture the impact of different microarchitectural components. It derives these performance distributions using simple analytical models that estimate bounds on performance induced by each microarchitectural component, providing a simple yet rich representation of a program's performance characteristics across a large space of microarchitectural parameters. Experiments show that Concorde is more than five orders of magnitude faster than a reference cycle-level simulator, with about 2% average Cycles-Per-Instruction (CPI) prediction error across a range of SPEC, open-source, and proprietary benchmarks. This enables rapid design-space exploration and performance sensitivity analyses that are currently infeasible, e.g., in about an hour, we conducted a first-of-its-kind fine-grained performance attribution to different microarchitectural components across a diverse set of programs, requiring nearly 150 million CPI evaluations.</description>

      <title>InkFM: A Foundational Model for Full-Page Online Handwritten Note Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tablets and styluses are increasingly popular for taking notes. To optimize this experience and ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, it's important to develop methods for accurately interpreting and understanding the content of handwritten digital notes. We introduce a foundational model called InkFM for analyzing full pages of handwritten content. Trained on a diverse mixture of tasks, this model offers a unique combination of capabilities: recognizing text in 28 different scripts, mathematical expressions recognition, and segmenting pages into distinct elements like text and drawings. Our results demonstrate that these tasks can be effectively unified within a single model, achieving SoTA text line segmentation out-of-the-box quality surpassing public baselines like docTR. Fine- or LoRA-tuning our base model on public datasets further improves the quality of page segmentation, achieves state-of the art text recognition (DeepWriting, CASIA, SCUT, and Mathwriting datasets) and sketch classification (QuickDraw). This adaptability of InkFM provides a powerful starting point for developing applications with handwritten input.</description>

      <title>SupertonicTTS: Towards Highly Scalable and Efficient Text-to-Speech System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system, namely SupertonicTTS, for improved scalability and efficiency in speech synthesis. SupertonicTTS is comprised of three components: a speech autoencoder for continuous latent representation, a text-to-latent module leveraging flow-matching for text-to-latent mapping, and an utterance-level duration predictor. To enable a lightweight architecture, we employ a low-dimensional latent space, temporal compression of latents, and ConvNeXt blocks. We further simplify the TTS pipeline by operating directly on raw character-level text and employing cross-attention for text-speech alignment, thus eliminating the need for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) modules and external aligners. In addition, we introduce context-sharing batch expansion that accelerates loss convergence and stabilizes text-speech alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that SupertonicTTS achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing architectural complexity and computational overhead compared to contemporary TTS models. Audio samples demonstrating the capabilities of SupertonicTTS are available at: https://supertonictts.github.io/.</description>

      <title>CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive Program Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Unreliable for Cyber Threat Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent works have argued that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to tame the data deluge in the cybersecurity field, by improving the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. This work presents an evaluation methodology that other than allowing to test LLMs on CTI tasks when using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and fine-tuning, also allows to quantify their consistency and their confidence level. We run experiments with three state-of-the-art LLMs and a dataset of 350 threat intelligence reports and present new evidence of potential security risks in relying on LLMs for CTI. We show how LLMs cannot guarantee sufficient performance on real-size reports while also being inconsistent and overconfident. Few-shot learning and fine-tuning only partially improve the results, thus posing doubts about the possibility of using LLMs for CTI scenarios, where labelled datasets are lacking and where confidence is a fundamental factor.</description>

      <title>The Challenge of Achieving Attributability in Multilingual Table-to-Text Generation with Question-Answer Blueprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual Natural Language Generation (NLG) is challenging due to the lack of training data for low-resource languages. However, some low-resource languages have up to tens of millions of speakers globally, making it important to improve NLG tools for them. Table-to-Text NLG is an excellent measure of models' reasoning abilities but is very challenging in the multilingual setting. System outputs are often not attributable, or faithful, to the data in the source table. Intermediate planning techniques like Question-Answer (QA) blueprints have been shown to improve attributability on summarisation tasks. This work explores whether QA blueprints make multilingual Table-to-Text outputs more attributable to the input tables. This paper extends the challenging multilingual Table-to-Text dataset, TaTA, which includes African languages, with QA blueprints. Sequence-to-sequence language models are then finetuned on this dataset, with and without blueprints. Results show that QA blueprints improve performance for models finetuned and evaluated only on English examples, but do not demonstrate gains in the multilingual setting. This is due to inaccuracies in machine translating the blueprints from English into target languages when generating the training data, and models failing to rely closely on the blueprints they generate. An in-depth analysis is conducted on why this is challenging.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Networks Can (Meta-)Learn the Same-Different Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have come to match and exceed human performance in many settings, the tasks these models optimize for are largely constrained to the level of individual objects, such as classification and captioning. Humans remain vastly superior to CNNs in visual tasks involving relations, including the ability to identify two objects as `same' or `different'. A number of studies have shown that while CNNs can be coaxed into learning the same-different relation in some settings, they tend to generalize poorly to other instances of this relation. In this work we show that the same CNN architectures that fail to generalize the same-different relation with conventional training are able to succeed when trained via meta-learning, which explicitly encourages abstraction and generalization across tasks.</description>

      <title>RECALL-MM: A Multimodal Dataset of Consumer Product Recalls for Risk Analysis using Computational Methods and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Product recalls provide valuable insights into potential risks and hazards within the engineering design process, yet their full potential remains underutilized. In this study, we curate data from the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalls database to develop a multimodal dataset, RECALL-MM, that informs data-driven risk assessment using historical information, and augment it using generative methods. Patterns in the dataset highlight specific areas where improved safety measures could have significant impact. We extend our analysis by demonstrating interactive clustering maps that embed all recalls into a shared latent space based on recall descriptions and product names. Leveraging these data-driven tools, we explore three case studies to demonstrate the dataset's utility in identifying product risks and guiding safer design decisions. The first two case studies illustrate how designers can visualize patterns across recalled products and situate new product ideas within the broader recall landscape to proactively anticipate hazards. In the third case study, we extend our approach by employing a large language model (LLM) to predict potential hazards based solely on product images. This demonstrates the model's ability to leverage visual context to identify risk factors, revealing strong alignment with historical recall data across many hazard categories. However, the analysis also highlights areas where hazard prediction remains challenging, underscoring the importance of risk awareness throughout the design process. Collectively, this work aims to bridge the gap between historical recall data and future product safety, presenting a scalable, data-driven approach to safer engineering design.</description>

      <title>Aurelia: Test-time Reasoning Distillation in Audio-Visual LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning optimization have greatly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, existing work fails to address the complexities of audio-visual scenarios, underscoring the need for further research. In this paper, we introduce AURELIA, a novel actor-critic based audio-visual (AV) reasoning framework that distills structured, step-by-step reasoning into AVLLMs at test time, improving their ability to process complex multi-modal inputs without additional training or fine-tuning. To further advance AVLLM reasoning skills, we present AVReasonBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 4500 audio-visual questions, each paired with detailed step-by-step reasoning. Our benchmark spans six distinct tasks, including AV-GeoIQ, which evaluates AV reasoning combined with geographical and cultural knowledge. Evaluating 18 AVLLMs on AVReasonBench reveals significant limitations in their multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Using AURELIA, we achieve up to a 100% relative improvement, demonstrating its effectiveness. This performance gain highlights the potential of reasoning-enhanced data generation for advancing AVLLMs in real-world applications. Our code and data will be publicly released at: https: //github.com/schowdhury671/aurelia.</description>

      <title>Beyond Contrastive Learning: Synthetic Data Enables List-wise Training with Multiple Levels of Relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have allowed the augmentation of information retrieval (IR) pipelines with synthetic data in various ways. Yet, the main training paradigm remains: contrastive learning with binary relevance labels and the InfoNCE loss, where one positive document is compared against one or more negatives. This objective treats all documents that are not explicitly annotated as relevant on an equally negative footing, regardless of their actual degree of relevance, thus (a) missing subtle nuances that are useful for ranking and (b) being susceptible to annotation noise. To overcome this limitation, in this work we forgo real training documents and annotations altogether and use open-source LLMs to directly generate synthetic documents that answer real user queries according to several different levels of relevance. This fully synthetic ranking context of graduated relevance, together with an appropriate list-wise loss (Wasserstein distance), enables us to train dense retrievers in a way that better captures the ranking task. Experiments on various IR datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms conventional training with InfoNCE by a large margin. Without using any real documents for training, our dense retriever significantly outperforms the same retriever trained through self-supervision. More importantly, it matches the performance of the same retriever trained on real, labeled training documents of the same dataset, while being more robust to distribution shift and clearly outperforming it when evaluated zero-shot on the BEIR dataset collection.</description>

      <title>FIESTA: Fisher Information-based Efficient Selective Test-time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust facial expression recognition in unconstrained, "in-the-wild" environments remains challenging due to significant domain shifts between training and testing distributions. Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by adapting pre-trained models during inference without requiring labeled test data. However, existing TTA approaches typically rely on manually selecting which parameters to update, potentially leading to suboptimal adaptation and high computational costs. This paper introduces a novel Fisher-driven selective adaptation framework that dynamically identifies and updates only the most critical model parameters based on their importance as quantified by Fisher information. By integrating this principled parameter selection approach with temporal consistency constraints, our method enables efficient and effective adaptation specifically tailored for video-based facial expression recognition. Experiments on the challenging AffWild2 benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing TTA methods, achieving a 7.7% improvement in F1 score over the base model while adapting only 22,000 parameters-more than 20 times fewer than comparable methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that parameter importance can be effectively estimated from minimal data, with sampling just 1-3 frames sufficient for substantial performance gains. The proposed approach not only enhances recognition accuracy but also dramatically reduces computational overhead, making test-time adaptation more practical for real-world affective computing applications.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Environment Adaptation of Data-Driven Underwater Acoustic Source Ranging Based on Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting pre-trained deep learning models to new and unknown environments is a difficult challenge in underwater acoustic localization. We show that although pre-trained models have performance that suffers from mismatch between the training and test data, they generally exhibit a higher ``implied uncertainty'' in environments where there is more mismatch. Leveraging this notion of implied uncertainty, we partition the test samples into more certain and less certain sets, and implement an estimation method using the certain samples to improve the labeling for uncertain samples, which helps to adapt the model. We use an efficient method to quantify model prediction uncertainty, and an innovative approach to adapt a pre-trained model to unseen underwater environments at test time. This eliminates the need for labeled data from the target environment or the original training data. This adaptation is enhanced by integrating an independent estimate based on the received signal energy. We validate the approach extensively using real experimental data, as well as synthetic data consisting of model-generated signals with real ocean noise. The results demonstrate significant improvements in model prediction accuracy, underscoring the potential of the method to enhance underwater acoustic localization in diverse, noisy, and unknown environments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the underwater acoustic localization in the presence of environmental mismatch. Especially, we exploit a pre-trained neural network for the acoustic wave propagation in a gradient-based optimization framework to estimate the source location. To alleviate the effect of mismatch between the training data and the test data, we simultaneously optimize over the network weights at the inference time, and provide conditions under which this method is effective. Moreover, we introduce a physics-inspired modularity in the forward model that enables us to learn the path lengths of the multipath structure in an end-to-end training manner without access to the specific path labels. We investigate the validity of the assumptions in a simple yet illustrative environment model.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Environment Adaptation for Deep Learning-Based Underwater Acoustic Source Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to adapt a pre-trained deep-learning-based model for underwater acoustic localization to a new environment. We use unsupervised domain adaptation to improve the generalization performance of the model, i.e., using an unsupervised loss, fine-tune the pre-trained network parameters without access to any labels of the target environment or any data used to pre-train the model. This method improves the pre-trained model prediction by coupling that with an almost independent estimation based on the received signal energy (that depends on the source). We show the effectiveness of this approach on Bellhop generated data in an environment similar to that of the SWellEx-96 experiment contaminated with real ocean noise from the KAM11 experiment.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Image Super-Resolution Transformer Trained on Low-Resolution Images Only</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer architectures prominently lead single-image super-resolution (SISR) benchmarks, reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Their strong representative power, however, comes with a higher demand for training data compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For many real-world SR applications, the availability of high-quality HR training images is not given, sparking interest in LR-only training methods. The LR-only SISR benchmark mimics this condition by allowing only low-resolution (LR) images for model training. For a 4x super-resolution, this effectively reduces the amount of available training data to 6.25% of the HR image pixels, which puts the employment of a data-hungry transformer model into question. In this work, we are the first to utilize a lightweight vision transformer model with LR-only training methods addressing the unsupervised SISR LR-only benchmark. We adopt and configure a recent LR-only training method from microscopy image super-resolution to macroscopic real-world data, resulting in our multi-scale training method for bicubic degradation (MSTbic). Furthermore, we compare it with reference methods and prove its effectiveness both for a transformer and a CNN model. We evaluate on the classic SR benchmark datasets Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, and Manga109, and show superior performance over state-of-the-art (so far: CNN-based) LR-only SISR methods. The code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/ifnspaml/SuperResolutionMultiscaleTraining.</description>

      <title>Localized Graph-Based Neural Dynamics Models for Terrain Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive models can be particularly helpful for robots to effectively manipulate terrains in construction sites and extraterrestrial surfaces. However, terrain state representations become extremely high-dimensional especially to capture fine-resolution details and when depth is unknown or unbounded. This paper introduces a learning-based approach for terrain dynamics modeling and manipulation, leveraging the Graph-based Neural Dynamics (GBND) framework to represent terrain deformation as motion of a graph of particles. Based on the principle that the moving portion of a terrain is usually localized, our approach builds a large terrain graph (potentially millions of particles) but only identifies a very small active subgraph (hundreds of particles) for predicting the outcomes of robot-terrain interaction. To minimize the size of the active subgraph we introduce a learning-based approach that identifies a small region of interest (RoI) based on the robot's control inputs and the current scene. We also introduce a novel domain boundary feature encoding that allows GBNDs to perform accurate dynamics prediction in the RoI interior while avoiding particle penetration through RoI boundaries. Our proposed method is both orders of magnitude faster than naive GBND and it achieves better overall prediction accuracy. We further evaluated our framework on excavation and shaping tasks on terrain with different granularity.</description>

      <title>Extracting Patient History from Clinical Text: A Comparative Study of Clinical Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting medical history entities (MHEs) related to a patient's chief complaint (CC), history of present illness (HPI), and past, family, and social history (PFSH) helps structure free-text clinical notes into standardized EHRs, streamlining downstream tasks like continuity of care, medical coding, and quality metrics. Fine-tuned clinical large language models (cLLMs) can assist in this process while ensuring the protection of sensitive data via on-premises deployment. This study evaluates the performance of cLLMs in recognizing CC/HPI/PFSH-related MHEs and examines how note characteristics impact model accuracy. We annotated 1,449 MHEs across 61 outpatient-related clinical notes from the MTSamples repository. To recognize these entities, we fine-tuned seven state-of-the-art cLLMs. Additionally, we assessed the models' performance when enhanced by integrating, problems, tests, treatments, and other basic medical entities (BMEs). We compared the performance of these models against GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. To further understand the textual characteristics affecting model accuracy, we conducted an error analysis focused on note length, entity length, and segmentation. The cLLMs showed potential in reducing the time required for extracting MHEs by over 20%. However, detecting many types of MHEs remained challenging due to their polysemous nature and the frequent involvement of non-medical vocabulary. Fine-tuned GatorTron and GatorTronS, two of the most extensively trained cLLMs, demonstrated the highest performance. Integrating pre-identified BME information improved model performance for certain entities. Regarding the impact of textual characteristics on model performance, we found that longer entities were harder to identify, note length did not correlate with a higher error rate, and well-organized segments with headings are beneficial for the extraction.</description>

      <title>Using Source-Side Confidence Estimation for Reliable Translation into Unfamiliar Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an interactive machine translation (MT) system designed for users who are not proficient in the target language. It aims to improve trustworthiness and explainability by identifying potentially mistranslated words and allowing the user to intervene to correct mistranslations. However, confidence estimation in machine translation has traditionally focused on the target side. Whereas the conventional approach to source-side confidence estimation would have been to project target word probabilities to the source side via word alignments, we propose a direct, alignment-free approach that measures how sensitive the target word probabilities are to changes in the source embeddings. Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional alignment-based methods at detection of mistranslations.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Active Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter refers to systems composed of self-propelled entities that consume energy to produce motion, exhibiting complex non-equilibrium dynamics that challenge traditional models. With the rapid advancements in machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for addressing the complexities of active matter. This review systematically introduces the integration of RL for guiding and controlling active matter systems, focusing on two key aspects: optimal motion strategies for individual active particles and the regulation of collective dynamics in active swarms. We discuss the use of RL to optimize the navigation, foraging, and locomotion strategies for individual active particles. In addition, the application of RL in regulating collective behaviors is also examined, emphasizing its role in facilitating the self-organization and goal-directed control of active swarms. This investigation offers valuable insights into how RL can advance the understanding, manipulation, and control of active matter, paving the way for future developments in fields such as biological systems, robotics, and medical science.</description>

      <title>SPIO: Ensemble and Selective Strategies via LLM-Based Multi-Agent Planning in Automated Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated data analytics and machine learning by enabling dynamic reasoning and adaptability. While recent approaches have advanced multi-stage pipelines through multi-agent systems, they typically rely on rigid, single-path workflows that limit the exploration and integration of diverse strategies, often resulting in suboptimal predictions. To address these challenges, we propose SPIO (Sequential Plan Integration and Optimization), a novel framework that leverages LLM-driven decision-making to orchestrate multi-agent planning across four key modules: data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and hyperparameter tuning. In each module, dedicated planning agents independently generate candidate strategies that cascade into subsequent stages, fostering comprehensive exploration. A plan optimization agent refines these strategies by suggesting several optimized plans. We further introduce two variants: SPIO-S, which selects a single best solution path as determined by the LLM, and SPIO-E, which selects the top k candidate plans and ensembles them to maximize predictive performance. Extensive experiments on Kaggle and OpenML datasets demonstrate that SPIO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a robust and scalable solution for automated data science task.</description>

      <title>AI Agents in Engineering Design: A Multi-Agent Framework for Aesthetic and Aerodynamic Car Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "Design Agents" for engineering applications, particularly focusing on the automotive design process, while emphasizing that our approach can be readily extended to other engineering and design domains. Our framework integrates AI-driven design agents into the traditional engineering workflow, demonstrating how these specialized computational agents interact seamlessly with engineers and designers to augment creativity, enhance efficiency, and significantly accelerate the overall design cycle. By automating and streamlining tasks traditionally performed manually, such as conceptual sketching, styling enhancements, 3D shape retrieval and generative modeling, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) meshing, and aerodynamic simulations, our approach reduces certain aspects of the conventional workflow from weeks and days down to minutes. These agents leverage state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), large language models (LLMs), and geometric deep learning techniques, providing rapid iteration and comprehensive design exploration capabilities. We ground our methodology in industry-standard benchmarks, encompassing a wide variety of conventional automotive designs, and utilize high-fidelity aerodynamic simulations to ensure practical and applicable outcomes. Furthermore, we present design agents that can swiftly and accurately predict simulation outcomes, empowering engineers and designers to engage in more informed design optimization and exploration. This research underscores the transformative potential of integrating advanced generative AI techniques into complex engineering tasks, paving the way for broader adoption and innovation across multiple engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>HiPART: Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer for Occluded 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing 2D-to-3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods struggle with the occlusion issue by enriching information like temporal and visual cues in the lifting stage. In this paper, we argue that these methods ignore the limitation of the sparse skeleton 2D input representation, which fundamentally restricts the 2D-to-3D lifting and worsens the occlusion issue. To address these, we propose a novel two-stage generative densification method, named Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer (HiPART), to generate hierarchical 2D dense poses from the original sparse 2D pose. Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale skeleton tokenization module to quantize the highly dense 2D pose into hierarchical tokens and propose a Skeleton-aware Alignment to strengthen token connections. We then develop a Hierarchical AutoRegressive Modeling scheme for hierarchical 2D pose generation. With generated hierarchical poses as inputs for 2D-to-3D lifting, the proposed method shows strong robustness in occluded scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-frame-based 3D HPE. Moreover, it outperforms numerous multi-frame methods while reducing parameter and computational complexity and can also complement them to further enhance performance and robustness.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Are Better Logical Fallacy Reasoners with Counterargument, Explanation, and Goal-Aware Prompt Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has greatly improved our ability to process complex language. However, accurately detecting logical fallacies remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel and effective prompt formulation approach for logical fallacy detection, applicable in both supervised (fine-tuned) and unsupervised (zero-shot) settings. Our method enriches input text incorporating implicit contextual information -- counterarguments, explanations, and goals -- which we query for validity within the context of the argument. We then rank these queries based on confidence scores to inform classification. We evaluate our approach across multiple datasets from 5 domains, covering 29 distinct fallacy types, using models from the GPT and LLaMA series. The results show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models, with F1 score increases of up to 0.60 in zero-shot settings and up to 0.45 in fine-tuned models. Extensive analyses further illustrate why and how our method excels.</description>

      <title>KernelDNA: Dynamic Kernel Sharing via Decoupled Naive Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic convolution enhances model capacity by adaptively combining multiple kernels, yet faces critical trade-offs: prior works either (1) incur significant parameter overhead by scaling kernel numbers linearly, (2) compromise inference speed through complex kernel interactions, or (3) struggle to jointly optimize dynamic attention and static kernels. We also observe that pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit inter-layer redundancy akin to that in Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, dense convolutional layers can be efficiently replaced by derived ``child" layers generated from a shared ``parent" convolutional kernel through an adapter.
  To address these limitations and implement the weight-sharing mechanism, we propose a lightweight convolution kernel plug-in, named KernelDNA. It decouples kernel adaptation into input-dependent dynamic routing and pre-trained static modulation, ensuring both parameter efficiency and hardware-friendly inference. Unlike existing dynamic convolutions that expand parameters via multi-kernel ensembles, our method leverages cross-layer weight sharing and adapter-based modulation, enabling dynamic kernel specialization without altering the standard convolution structure. This design preserves the native computational efficiency of standard convolutions while enhancing representation power through input-adaptive kernel adjustments. Experiments on image classification and dense prediction tasks demonstrate that KernelDNA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency balance among dynamic convolution variants. Our codes are available at https://github.com/haiduo/KernelDNA.</description>

      <title>COSMIC: Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space Integration for Robust CLIP Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) face significant challenges in test-time adaptation to novel domains. While cache-based methods show promise by leveraging historical information, they struggle with both caching unreliable feature-label pairs and indiscriminately using single-class information during querying, significantly compromising adaptation accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose COSMIC (Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space Integration for CLIP), a robust test-time adaptation framework that enhances adaptability through multi-granular, cross-modal semantic caching and graph-based querying mechanisms. Our framework introduces two key innovations: Dual Semantics Graph (DSG) and Clique Guided Hyper-class (CGH). The Dual Semantics Graph constructs complementary semantic spaces by incorporating textual features, coarse-grained CLIP features, and fine-grained DINOv2 features to capture rich semantic relationships. Building upon these dual graphs, the Clique Guided Hyper-class component leverages structured class relationships to enhance prediction robustness through correlated class selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate COSMIC's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods: 15.81% gain on out-of-distribution tasks and 5.33% on cross-domain generation with CLIP RN-50.

      <description>arXiv:2503.23408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) presents as a revolutionary approach to weather forecasting by using quantum computing to improve predictive modeling capabilities. In this study, we apply QML models, including Quantum Gated Recurrent Units (QGRUs), Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory(QLSTM), Variational Quantum Circuits(VQCs), and Quantum Support Vector Machines(QSVMs), to analyze meteorological time-series data from the ERA5 dataset. Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization. This research provides insights into the feasibility of QML for weather prediction, paving the way for further exploration of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks to enhance meteorological forecasting.</description>

      <title>DGSAM: Domain Generalization via Individual Sharpness-Aware Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn models that can generalize well to unseen domains by training only on a set of source domains. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been a popular approach for this, aiming to find flat minima in the total loss landscape. However, we show that minimizing the total loss sharpness does not guarantee sharpness across individual domains. In particular, SAM can converge to fake flat minima, where the total loss may exhibit flat minima, but sharp minima are present in individual domains. Moreover, the current perturbation update in gradient ascent steps is ineffective in directly updating the sharpness of individual domains. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a novel DG algorithm, Decreased-overhead Gradual Sharpness-Aware Minimization (DGSAM), that applies gradual domain-wise perturbation to reduce sharpness consistently across domains while maintaining computational efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that DGSAM outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods, achieving improved robustness to domain shifts and better performance across various benchmarks, while reducing computational overhead compared to SAM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems powered by large language models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding human speech and generating appropriate spoken responses. However, these systems struggle with end-turn detection (ETD) -- the ability to distinguish between user turn completion and hesitation. This limitation often leads to premature or delayed responses, disrupting the flow of spoken conversations. In this paper, we introduce the ETD Dataset, the first public dataset for end-turn detection. The ETD dataset consists of both synthetic speech data generated with text-to-speech models and real-world speech data collected from web sources. We also propose SpeculativeETD, a novel collaborative inference framework that balances efficiency and accuracy to improve real-time ETD in resource-constrained environments. Our approach jointly employs a lightweight GRU-based model, which rapidly detects the non-speaking units in real-time on local devices, and a high-performance Wav2vec-based model running on the server to make a more challenging classification of distinguishing turn ends from mere pauses. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SpeculativeETD significantly improves ETD accuracy while keeping the required computations low. Datasets and code will be available after the review.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Preserving Transformations as Mutation Operators: A Study on Their Effectiveness in Defect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in defect detection use language models. Existing works enhanced the training data to improve the models' robustness when applied to semantically identical code (i.e., predictions should be the same). However, the use of semantically identical code has not been considered for improving the tools during their application - a concept closely related to metamorphic testing.
  The goal of our study is to determine whether we can use semantic-preserving transformations, analogue to mutation operators, to improve the performance of defect detection tools in the testing stage. We first collect existing publications which implemented semantic-preserving transformations and share their implementation, such that we can reuse them. We empirically study the effectiveness of three different ensemble strategies for enhancing defect detection tools. We apply the collected transformations on the Devign dataset, considering vulnerabilities as a type of defect, and two fine-tuned large language models for defect detection (VulBERTa, PLBART). We found 28 publications with 94 different transformations.
  We choose to implement 39 transformations from four of the publications, but a manual check revealed that 23 out 39 transformations change code semantics. Using the 16 remaining, correct transformations and three ensemble strategies, we were not able to increase the accuracy of the defect detection models. Our results show that reusing shared semantic-preserving transformation is difficult, sometimes even causing wrongful changes to the semantics.

      <title>Accelerated Stein Variational Gradient Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a kernel-based particle method for sampling from a target distribution, e.g., in generative modeling and Bayesian inference. SVGD does not require estimating the gradient of the log-density, which is called score estimation. In practice, SVGD can be slow compared to score-estimation based sampling algorithms. To design fast and efficient high-dimensional sampling algorithms, we introduce ASVGD, an accelerated SVGD, based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric space of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a momentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of particles deterministically. To stabilize the particles' momentum update, we also study a Wasserstein metric regularization. For the generalized bilinear kernel and the Gaussian kernel, toy numerical examples with varied target distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other popular sampling methods.</description>

      <title>Codehacks: A Dataset of Adversarial Tests for Competitive Programming Problems Obtained from Codeforces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software is used in critical applications in our day-to-day life and it is important to ensure its correctness. One popular approach to assess correctness is to evaluate software on tests. If a test fails, it indicates a fault in the software under test; if all tests pass correctly, one may assume that the software is correct. However, the reliability of these results depends on the test suite considered, and there is a risk of false negatives (i.e. software that passes all available tests but contains bugs because some cases are not tested). Therefore, it is important to consider error-inducing test cases when evaluating software.
  To support data-driven creation of such a test-suite, which is especially of interest for testing software synthesized from large language models, we curate a dataset (Codehacks) of programming problems together with corresponding error-inducing test cases (i.e., "hacks"). This dataset is collected from the wild, in particular, from the Codeforces online judge platform. The dataset comprises 288,617 hacks for 5,578 programming problems, each with a natural language description, as well as the source code for 2,196 submitted solutions to these problems that can be broken with their corresponding hacks.

      <title>Order Independence With Finetuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on many NLP tasks, yet often exhibit order dependence: simply reordering semantically identical tokens (e.g., answer choices in multiple-choice questions) can lead to inconsistent predictions. Recent work proposes Set-Based Prompting (SBP) as a way to remove order information from designated token subsets, thereby mitigating positional biases. However, applying SBP on base models induces an out-of-distribution input format, which can degrade in-distribution performance. We introduce a fine-tuning strategy that integrates SBP into the training process, "pulling" these set-formatted prompts closer to the model's training manifold. We show that SBP can be incorporated into a model via fine-tuning. Our experiments on in-distribution (MMLU) and out-of-distribution (CSQA, ARC Challenge) multiple-choice tasks show that SBP fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy and robustness to answer-order permutations, all while preserving broader language modeling capabilities. We discuss the broader implications of order-invariant modeling and outline future directions for building fairer, more consistent LLMs.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Systematic Relational Reasoning with Large Language and Reasoning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to struggle with systematic reasoning. Even on tasks where they appear to perform well, their performance often depends on shortcuts, rather than on genuine reasoning abilities, leading them to collapse on out-of-distribution examples. Post-training strategies based on reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought prompting have recently been hailed as a step change. However, little is still known about the potential of the resulting ``Large Reasoning Models'' (LRMs) beyond problem solving in mathematics and programming, where finding genuine out-of-distribution problems can be difficult. In this paper, we focus on tasks that require systematic reasoning about relational compositions, especially for qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. These tasks allow us to control the difficulty of problem instances, and measure in a precise way to what extent models can generalise. We find that that the considered LLMs and LRMs overall perform poorly overall, albeit better than random chance.</description>

Abstract: A method for approximating continuous functions $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ by a linear superposition of continuous functions $\mathbb{Z}_{p}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is presented and a polynomial regression model is constructed that allows approximating such functions with any degree of accuracy. A physical interpretation of such a model is given and possible methods for its training are discussed. The proposed model can be considered as a simple alternative to possible $p$-adic models based on neural network architecture.</description>

      <title>POINT$^{2}$: A Polymer Informatics Training and Testing Database</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of polymer informatics has been significantly propelled by the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques, enabling the rapid prediction of polymer properties and expediting the discovery of high-performance polymeric materials. However, the field lacks a standardized workflow that encompasses prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, ML interpretability, and polymer synthesizability. In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density. The POINT$^{2}$ database can serve as a valuable resource for the polymer informatics community for polymer discovery and optimization.</description>

      <title>Boosting Omnidirectional Stereo Matching with a Pre-trained Depth Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Omnidirectional depth perception is essential for mobile robotics applications that require scene understanding across a full 360{\deg} field of view. Camera-based setups offer a cost-effective option by using stereo depth estimation to generate dense, high-resolution depth maps without relying on expensive active sensing. However, existing omnidirectional stereo matching approaches achieve only limited depth accuracy across diverse environments, depth ranges, and lighting conditions, due to the scarcity of real-world data. We present DFI-OmniStereo, a novel omnidirectional stereo matching method that leverages a large-scale pre-trained foundation model for relative monocular depth estimation within an iterative optimization-based stereo matching architecture. We introduce a dedicated two-stage training strategy to utilize the relative monocular depth features for our omnidirectional stereo matching before scale-invariant fine-tuning. DFI-OmniStereo achieves state-of-the-art results on the real-world Helvipad dataset, reducing disparity MAE by approximately 16% compared to the previous best omnidirectional stereo method.</description>

      <title>Federated Self-Supervised Learning for One-Shot Cross-Modal and Cross-Imaging Technique Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning enables learning of data representations from multiple sources without compromising the privacy of the clients. In applications like medical image segmentation, where obtaining a large annotated dataset from a single source is a distressing problem, federated self-supervised learning can provide some solace. In this work, we push the limits further by exploring a federated self-supervised one-shot segmentation task representing a more data-scarce scenario. We adopt a pre-existing self-supervised few-shot segmentation framework CoWPro and adapt it to the federated learning scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to attempt a self-supervised few-shot segmentation task in the federated learning domain. Moreover, we consider the clients to be constituted of data from different modalities and imaging techniques like MR or CT, which makes the problem even harder. Additionally, we reinforce and improve the baseline CoWPro method using a fused dice loss which shows considerable improvement in performance over the baseline CoWPro. Finally, we evaluate this novel framework on a completely unseen held-out part of the local client dataset. We observe that the proposed framework can achieve performance at par or better than the FedAvg version of the CoWPro framework on the held-out validation dataset.</description>

      <title>Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting for Enhancing Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with tasks requiring external knowledge, such as knowledge-intensive Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA). Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Addressing Model Overcomplexity in Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction With Molecular Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is crucial for pharmaceutical research and clinical safety. Recent deep learning models often suffer from high computational costs and limited generalization across datasets. In this study, we investigate a simpler yet effective approach using molecular representations such as Morgan fingerprints (MFPS), graph-based embeddings from graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and transformer-derived embeddings from MoLFormer integrated into a straightforward neural network. We benchmark our implementation on DrugBank DDI splits and a drug-drug affinity (DDA) dataset from the Food and Drug Administration. MFPS along with MoLFormer and GCN representations achieve competitive performance across tasks, even in the more challenging leak-proof split, highlighting the sufficiency of simple molecular representations. Moreover, we are able to identify key molecular motifs and structural patterns relevant to drug interactions via gradient-based analyses using the representations under study. Despite these results, dataset limitations such as insufficient chemical diversity, limited dataset size, and inconsistent labeling impact robust evaluation and challenge the need for more complex approaches. Our work provides a meaningful baseline and emphasizes the need for better dataset curation and progressive complexity scaling.</description>

      <title>DASH: Detection and Assessment of Systematic Hallucinations of VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to object hallucinations, where they erroneously indicate the presenceof certain objects in an image. Existing benchmarks quantify hallucinations using relatively small, labeled datasets. However, this approach is i) insufficient to assess hallucinations that arise in open-world settings, where VLMs are widely used, and ii) inadequate for detecting systematic errors in VLMs. We propose DASH (Detection and Assessment of Systematic Hallucinations), an automatic, large-scale pipeline designed to identify systematic hallucinations of VLMs on real-world images in an open-world setting. A key component is DASH-OPT for image-based retrieval, where we optimize over the ''natural image manifold'' to generate images that mislead the VLM. The output of DASH consists of clusters of real and semantically similar images for which the VLM hallucinates an object. We apply DASH to PaliGemma and two LLaVA-NeXT models across 380 object classes and, in total, find more than 19k clusters with 950k images. We study the transfer of the identified systematic hallucinations to other VLMs and show that fine-tuning PaliGemma with the model-specific images obtained with DASH mitigates object hallucinations. Code and data are available at https://YanNeu.github.io/DASH.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this article is to provide an introduction to the desirability function approach to multi-objective optimization (direct and surrogate model-based), and multi-objective hyperparameter tuning. This work is based on the paper by Kuhn (2016). It presents a `Python` implementation of Kuhn's `R` package `desirability`. The `Python` package `spotdesirability` is available as part of the `sequential parameter optimization` framework. After a brief introduction to the desirability function approach is presented, three examples are given that demonstrate how to use the desirability functions for classical optimization, surrogate-model based optimization, and hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization and Integral Quadratic Constraints: A new approach to regret analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for analyzing dynamic regret of first-order constrained online convex optimization algorithms for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth objectives. Crucially, we provide a general analysis that is applicable to a wide range of first-order algorithms that can be expressed as an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a first-order oracle. By leveraging Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs), we derive a semi-definite program which, when feasible, provides a regret guarantee for the online algorithm. For this, the concept of variational IQCs is introduced as the generalization of IQCs to time-varying monotone operators. Our bounds capture the temporal rate of change of the problem in the form of the path length of the time-varying minimizer and the objective function variation. In contrast to standard results in OCO, our results do not require nerither the assumption of gradient boundedness, nor that of a bounded feasible set. Numerical analyses showcase the ability of the approach to capture the dependence of the regret on the function class condition number.</description>

      <title>Exploring GPT-4 for Robotic Agent Strategy with Real-Time State Feedback and a Reactive Behaviour Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of GPT-4 on a humanoid robot in simulation and the real world as proof of concept of a novel large language model (LLM) driven behaviour method. LLMs have shown the ability to perform various tasks, including robotic agent behaviour. The problem involves prompting the LLM with a goal, and the LLM outputs the sub-tasks to complete to achieve that goal. Previous works focus on the executability and correctness of the LLM's generated tasks. We propose a method that successfully addresses practical concerns around safety, transitions between tasks, time horizons of tasks and state feedback. In our experiments we have found that our approach produces output for feasible requests that can be executed every time, with smooth transitions. User requests are achieved most of the time across a range of goal time horizons.</description>

      <title>Space of Data through the Lens of Multilevel Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work seeks to tackle the inherent complexity of dataspaces by introducing a novel data structure that can represent datasets across multiple levels of abstraction, ranging from local to global. We propose the concept of a multilevel graph, which is equipped with two fundamental operations: contraction and expansion of its topology. This multilevel graph is specifically designed to fulfil the requirements for incremental abstraction and flexibility, as outlined in existing definitions of dataspaces. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive suite of methods for manipulating this graph structure, establishing a robust framework for data analysis. While its effectiveness has been empirically validated for unstructured data, its application to structured data is also inherently viable. Preliminary results are presented through a real-world scenario based on a collection of dream reports.</description>

      <title>An Organizationally-Oriented Approach to Enhancing Explainability and Control in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning can lead to the development of collaborative agent behaviors that show similarities with organizational concepts. Pushing forward this perspective, we introduce a novel framework that explicitly incorporates organizational roles and goals from the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ model into the MARL process, guiding agents to satisfy corresponding organizational constraints. By structuring training with roles and goals, we aim to enhance both the explainability and control of agent behaviors at the organizational level, whereas much of the literature primarily focuses on individual agents. Additionally, our framework includes a post-training analysis method to infer implicit roles and goals, offering insights into emergent agent behaviors. This framework has been applied across various MARL environments and algorithms, demonstrating coherence between predefined organizational specifications and those inferred from trained agents.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning in Physics: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly transforming various scientific fields, enabled by advancements in computational power and access to large data sets from experiments and simulations. As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow in capability, these algorithms will enable many scientific discoveries beyond human capabilities. Since the primary goal of science is to understand the world around us, fully leveraging machine learning in scientific discovery requires models that are interpretable -- allowing experts to comprehend the concepts underlying machine-learned predictions. Successful interpretations increase trust in black-box methods, help reduce errors, allow for the improvement of the underlying models, enhance human-AI collaboration, and ultimately enable fully automated scientific discoveries that remain understandable to human scientists. This review examines the role of interpretability in machine learning applied to physics. We categorize different aspects of interpretability, discuss machine learning models in terms of both interpretability and performance, and explore the philosophical implications of interpretability in scientific inquiry. Additionally, we highlight recent advances in interpretable machine learning across many subfields of physics. By bridging boundaries between disciplines -- each with its own unique insights and challenges -- we aim to establish interpretable machine learning as a core research focus in science.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach to Autonomous Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic congestion in modern cities is exacerbated by the limitations of traditional fixed-time traffic signal systems, which fail to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns. Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) algorithms have emerged as a solution by dynamically adjusting signal timing based on real-time traffic conditions. However, the main limitation of such methods is that they are not transferable to environments under real-world constraints, such as balancing efficiency, minimizing collisions, and ensuring fairness across intersections. In this paper, we view the ATSC problem as a constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a novel algorithm named Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Lagrange Cost Estimator (MAPPO-LCE) to produce effective traffic signal control policies. Our approach integrates the Lagrange multipliers method to balance rewards and constraints, with a cost estimator for stable adjustment. We also introduce three constraints on the traffic network: GreenTime, GreenSkip, and PhaseSkip, which penalize traffic policies that do not conform to real-world scenarios. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MAPPO-LCE outperforms three baseline MARL algorithms by across all environments and traffic constraints (improving on MAPPO by 12.60%, IPPO by 10.29%, and QTRAN by 13.10%). Our results show that constrained MARL is a valuable tool for traffic planners to deploy scalable and efficient ATSC methods in real-world traffic networks. We provide code at https://github.com/Asatheesh6561/MAPPO-LCE.</description>

      <title>Learning a Single Index Model from Anisotropic Data with vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning a Single Index Model (SIM)- a popular model for studying the ability of neural networks to learn features - from anisotropic Gaussian inputs by training a neuron using vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). While the isotropic case has been extensively studied, the anisotropic case has received less attention and the impact of the covariance matrix on the learning dynamics remains unclear. For instance, Mousavi-Hosseini et al. (2023b) proposed a spherical SGD that requires a separate estimation of the data covariance matrix, thereby oversimplifying the influence of covariance. In this study, we analyze the learning dynamics of vanilla SGD under the SIM with anisotropic input data, demonstrating that vanilla SGD automatically adapts to the data's covariance structure. Leveraging these results, we derive upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity using a notion of effective dimension that is determined by the structure of the covariance matrix instead of the input data dimension.</description>

      <title>Scalable Geometric Learning with Correlation-Based Functional Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation matrix is a central representation of functional brain networks in neuroimaging. Traditional analyses often treat pairwise interactions independently in a Euclidean setting, overlooking the intrinsic geometry of correlation matrices. While earlier attempts have embraced the quotient geometry of the correlation manifold, they remain limited by computational inefficiency and numerical instability, particularly in high-dimensional contexts. This paper presents a novel geometric framework that employs diffeomorphic transformations to embed correlation matrices into a Euclidean space, preserving salient manifold properties and enabling large-scale analyses. The proposed method integrates with established learning algorithms - regression, dimensionality reduction, and clustering - and extends naturally to population-level inference of brain networks. Simulation studies demonstrate both improved computational speed and enhanced accuracy compared to conventional manifold-based approaches. Moreover, applications in real neuroimaging scenarios illustrate the framework's utility, enhancing behavior score prediction, subject fingerprinting in resting-state fMRI, and hypothesis testing in electroencephalogram data. An open-source MATLAB toolbox is provided to facilitate broader adoption and advance the application of correlation geometry in functional brain network research.</description>

      <title>MKA: Leveraging Cross-Lingual Consensus for Model Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliability of LLMs is questionable even as they get better at more tasks. A wider adoption of LLMs is contingent on whether they are usably factual. And if they are not, on whether they can properly calibrate their confidence in their responses. This work focuses on utilizing the multilingual knowledge of an LLM to inform its decision to abstain or answer when prompted. We develop a multilingual pipeline to calibrate the model's confidence and let it abstain when uncertain. We run several multilingual models through the pipeline to profile them across different languages. We find that the performance of the pipeline varies by model and language, but that in general they benefit from it. This is evidenced by the accuracy improvement of $71.2\%$ for Bengali over a baseline performance without the pipeline. Even a high-resource language like English sees a $15.5\%$ improvement. These results hint at possible further improvements.</description>

      <title>Integral regularization PINNs for evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolution equations, including both ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs), play a pivotal role in modeling dynamic systems. However, achieving accurate long-time integration for these equations remains a significant challenge. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free framework for solving PDEs, they often suffer from temporal error accumulation, which limits their effectiveness in capturing long-time behaviors. To alleviate this issue, we propose integral regularization PINNs (IR-PINNs), a novel approach that enhances temporal accuracy by incorporating an integral-based residual term into the loss function. This method divides the entire time interval into smaller sub-intervals and enforces constraints over these sub-intervals, thereby improving the resolution and correlation of temporal dynamics. Furthermore, IR-PINNs leverage adaptive sampling to dynamically refine the distribution of collocation points based on the evolving solution, ensuring higher accuracy in regions with sharp gradients or rapid variations. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that IR-PINNs outperform original PINNs and other state-of-the-art methods in capturing long-time behaviors, offering a robust and accurate solution for evolution equations.</description>

      <title>Short-video Propagation Influence Rating: A New Real-world Dataset and A New Large Graph Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the interest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos, which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the superiority of our method for SPIR.</description>

      <title>THEMIS: Towards Practical Intellectual Property Protection for Post-Deployment On-Device Deep Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-device deep learning (DL) has rapidly gained adoption in mobile apps, offering the benefits of offline model inference and user privacy preservation over cloud-based approaches. However, it inevitably stores models on user devices, introducing new vulnerabilities, particularly model-stealing attacks and intellectual property infringement. While system-level protections like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide a robust solution, practical challenges remain in achieving scalable on-device DL model protection, including complexities in supporting third-party models and limited adoption in current mobile solutions. Advancements in TEE-enabled hardware, such as NVIDIA's GPU-based TEEs, may address these obstacles in the future. Currently, watermarking serves as a common defense against model theft but also faces challenges here as many mobile app developers lack corresponding machine learning expertise and the inherent read-only and inference-only nature of on-device DL models prevents third parties like app stores from implementing existing watermarking techniques in post-deployment models.
  To protect the intellectual property of on-device DL models, in this paper, we propose THEMIS, an automatic tool that lifts the read-only restriction of on-device DL models by reconstructing their writable counterparts and leverages the untrainable nature of on-device DL models to solve watermark parameters and protect the model owner's intellectual property. Extensive experimental results across various datasets and model structures show the superiority of THEMIS in terms of different metrics. Further, an empirical investigation of 403 real-world DL mobile apps from Google Play is performed with a success rate of 81.14%, showing the practicality of THEMIS.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of (Un-)Supervised Machine Learning Methods for GNSS Interference Classification with Real-World Data Discrepancies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy and reliability of vehicle localization on roads are crucial for applications such as self-driving cars, toll systems, and digital tachographs. To achieve accurate positioning, vehicles typically use global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers to validate their absolute positions. However, GNSS-based positioning can be compromised by interference signals, necessitating the identification, classification, determination of purpose, and localization of such interference to mitigate or eliminate it. Recent approaches based on machine learning (ML) have shown superior performance in monitoring interference. However, their feasibility in real-world applications and environments has yet to be assessed. Effective implementation of ML techniques requires training datasets that incorporate realistic interference signals, including real-world noise and potential multipath effects that may occur between transmitter, receiver, and satellite in the operational area. Additionally, these datasets require reference labels. Creating such datasets is often challenging due to legal restrictions, as causing interference to GNSS sources is strictly prohibited. Consequently, the performance of ML-based methods in practical applications remains unclear. To address this gap, we describe a series of large-scale measurement campaigns conducted in real-world settings at two highway locations in Germany and the Seetal Alps in Austria, and in large-scale controlled indoor environments. We evaluate the latest supervised ML-based methods to report on their performance in real-world settings and present the applicability of pseudo-labeling for unsupervised learning. We demonstrate the challenges of combining datasets due to data discrepancies and evaluate outlier detection, domain adaptation, and data augmentation techniques to present the models' capabilities to adapt to changes in the datasets.</description>

      <title>Force-Free Molecular Dynamics Through Autoregressive Equivariant Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in scientific research. Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system sizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on reducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for solving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In this work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework based on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly updates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by traditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various systems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural, dynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows for forecast intervals up to $30\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps, generating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than 4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended timescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments. An open-source implementation of TrajCast is accessible under https://github.com/IBM/trajcast.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Attention-Based Model for 5G Radio-based Outdoor Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-based localization in dynamic environments, such as urban and vehicular settings, requires systems that can efficiently adapt to varying signal conditions and environmental changes. Factors such as multipath interference and obstructions introduce different levels of complexity that affect the accuracy of the localization. Although generalized models offer broad applicability, they often struggle to capture the nuances of specific environments, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world deployments. In contrast, specialized models can be tailored to particular conditions, enabling more precise localization by effectively handling domain-specific variations and noise patterns. However, deploying multiple specialized models requires an efficient mechanism to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario. In this work, we develop an adaptive localization framework that combines shallow attention-based models with a router/switching mechanism based on a single-layer perceptron (SLP). This enables seamless transitions between specialized localization models optimized for different conditions, balancing accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to environmental variations. We design three low-complex localization models tailored for distinct scenarios, optimized for reduced computational complexity, test time, and model size. The router dynamically selects the most suitable model based on real-time input characteristics. The proposed framework is validated using real-world vehicle localization data collected from a massive MIMO base station (BS), demonstrating its ability to seamlessly adapt to diverse deployment conditions while maintaining high localization accuracy.</description>

      <title>Free Parametrization of L2-bounded State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured state-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a powerful architecture in machine learning and control, featuring stacked layers where each consists of a linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete-time system followed by a nonlinearity. While SSMs offer computational efficiency and excel in long-sequence predictions, their widespread adoption in applications like system identification and optimal control is hindered by the challenge of ensuring their stability and robustness properties. We introduce L2RU, a novel parametrization of SSMs that guarantees input-output stability and robustness by enforcing a prescribed L-bound for all parameter values. This design eliminates the need for complex constraints, allowing unconstrained optimization over L2RUs by using standard methods such as gradient descent. Leveraging tools from system theory and convex optimization, we derive a non-conservative parametrization of square discrete-time LTI systems with a specified L2-bound, forming the foundation of the L2RU architecture. Additionally, we enhance its performance with a bespoke initialization strategy optimized for long input sequences. Through a system identification task, we validate L2RU's superior performance, showcasing its potential in learning and control applications.</description>

      <title>A Channel-Triggered Backdoor Attack on Wireless Semantic Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of deep learning (DL) on wireless communication systems through data-driven end-to-end (E2E) learning, the security vulnerabilities of these systems have been largely overlooked. Unlike the extensively studied image domain, limited research has explored the threat of backdoor attacks on the reconstruction of symbols in semantic communication (SemCom) systems. Previous work has investigated such backdoor attacks at the input level, but these approaches are infeasible in applications with strict input control. In this paper, we propose a novel attack paradigm, termed Channel-Triggered Backdoor Attack (CT-BA), where the backdoor trigger is a specific wireless channel. This attack leverages fundamental physical layer characteristics, making it more covert and potentially more threatening compared to previous input-level attacks. Specifically, we utilize channel gain with different fading distributions or channel noise with different power spectral densities as potential triggers. This approach establishes unprecedented attack flexibility as the adversary can select backdoor triggers from both fading characteristics and noise variations in diverse channel environments. Moreover, during the testing phase, CT-BA enables automatic trigger activation through natural channel variations without requiring active adversary participation. We evaluate the robustness of CT-BA on a ViT-based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) model across three datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. Furthermore, we apply CT-BA to three typical E2E SemCom systems: BDJSCC, ADJSCC, and JSCCOFDM. Experimental results demonstrate that our attack achieves near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining effective stealth. Finally, we discuss potential defense mechanisms against such attacks.</description>

      <title>ZeroMimic: Distilling Robotic Manipulation Skills from Web Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many recent advances in robotic manipulation have come through imitation learning, yet these rely largely on mimicking a particularly hard-to-acquire form of demonstrations: those collected on the same robot in the same room with the same objects as the trained policy must handle at test time. In contrast, large pre-recorded human video datasets demonstrating manipulation skills in-the-wild already exist, which contain valuable information for robots. Is it possible to distill a repository of useful robotic skill policies out of such data without any additional requirements on robot-specific demonstrations or exploration? We present the first such system ZeroMimic, that generates immediately deployable image goal-conditioned skill policies for several common categories of manipulation tasks (opening, closing, pouring, pick&amp;place, cutting, and stirring) each capable of acting upon diverse objects and across diverse unseen task setups. ZeroMimic is carefully designed to exploit recent advances in semantic and geometric visual understanding of human videos, together with modern grasp affordance detectors and imitation policy classes. After training ZeroMimic on the popular EpicKitchens dataset of ego-centric human videos, we evaluate its out-of-the-box performance in varied real-world and simulated kitchen settings with two different robot embodiments, demonstrating its impressive abilities to handle these varied tasks. To enable plug-and-play reuse of ZeroMimic policies on other task setups and robots, we release software and policy checkpoints of our skill policies.</description>

      <title>Feature learning from non-Gaussian inputs: the case of Independent Component Analysis in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks learn structured features from complex, non-Gaussian inputs, but the mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood. Our work is motivated by the observation that the first-layer filters learnt by deep convolutional neural networks from natural images resemble those learnt by independent component analysis (ICA), a simple unsupervised method that seeks the most non-Gaussian projections of its inputs. This similarity suggests that ICA provides a simple, yet principled model for studying feature learning. Here, we leverage this connection to investigate the interplay between data structure and optimisation in feature learning for the most popular ICA algorithm, FastICA, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is used to train deep networks. We rigorously establish that FastICA requires at least $n\gtrsim d^4$ samples to recover a single non-Gaussian direction from $d$-dimensional inputs on a simple synthetic data model. We show that vanilla online SGD outperforms FastICA, and prove that the optimal sample complexity $n \gtrsim d^2$ can be reached by smoothing the loss, albeit in a data-dependent way. We finally demonstrate the existence of a search phase for FastICA on ImageNet, and discuss how the strong non-Gaussianity of said images compensates for the poor sample complexity of FastICA.</description>

      <title>Certified Approximate Reachability (CARe): Formal Error Bounds on Deep Learning of Reachable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent approaches to leveraging deep learning for computing reachable sets of continuous-time dynamical systems have gained popularity over traditional level-set methods, as they overcome the curse of dimensionality. However, as with level-set methods, considerable care needs to be taken in limiting approximation errors, particularly since no guarantees are provided during training on the accuracy of the learned reachable set. To address this limitation, we introduce an epsilon-approximate Hamilton-Jacobi Partial Differential Equation (HJ-PDE), which establishes a relationship between training loss and accuracy of the true reachable set. To formally certify this approximation, we leverage Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to bound the residual error of the HJ-based loss function across the domain of interest. Leveraging Counter Example Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS), we close the loop around learning and verification, by fine-tuning the neural network on counterexamples found by the SMT solver, thus improving the accuracy of the learned reachable set. To the best of our knowledge, Certified Approximate Reachability (CARe) is the first approach to provide soundness guarantees on learned reachable sets of continuous dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Model Hemorrhage and the Robustness Limits of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across natural language processing tasks, yet undergo significant performance degradation when modified for deployment through quantization, pruning, or decoding strategy adjustments. We define this phenomenon as model hemorrhage - performance decline caused by parameter alterations and architectural changes. Through systematic analysis of various LLM frameworks, we identify key vulnerability patterns: layer expansion frequently disrupts attention mechanisms, compression techniques induce information loss cascades, and decoding adjustments amplify prediction divergences. Our investigation reveals transformer architectures exhibit inherent robustness thresholds that determine hemorrhage severity across modification types. We propose three mitigation strategies: gradient-aware pruning preserves critical weight pathways, dynamic quantization scaling maintains activation integrity, and decoding calibration aligns generation trajectories with original model distributions. This work establishes foundational metrics for evaluating model stability during adaptation, providing practical guidelines for maintaining performance while enabling efficient LLM deployment. Our findings advance understanding of neural network resilience under architectural transformations, particularly for large-scale language models.</description>

      <title>Detecting Localized Density Anomalies in Multivariate Data via Coin-Flip Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting localized density differences in multivariate data is a crucial task in computational science. Such anomalies can indicate a critical system failure, lead to a groundbreaking scientific discovery, or reveal unexpected changes in data distribution. We introduce EagleEye, an anomaly detection method to compare two multivariate datasets with the aim of identifying local density anomalies, namely over- or under-densities affecting only localised regions of the feature space. Anomalies are detected by modelling, for each point, the ordered sequence of its neighbours' membership label as a coin-flipping process and monitoring deviations from the expected behaviour of such process. A unique advantage of our method is its ability to provide an accurate, entirely unsupervised estimate of the local signal purity. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In synthetic data, EagleEye accurately detects anomalies in multiple dimensions even when they affect a tiny fraction of the data. When applied to a challenging resonant anomaly detection benchmark task in simulated Large Hadron Collider data, EagleEye successfully identifies particle decay events present in just 0.3% of the dataset. In global temperature data, EagleEye uncovers previously unidentified, geographically localised changes in temperature fields that occurred in the most recent years. Thanks to its key advantages of conceptual simplicity, computational efficiency, trivial parallelisation, and scalability, EagleEye is widely applicable across many fields.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-assisted High-speed Combinatorial Optimization with Ising Machines for Dynamically Changing Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum or quantum-inspired Ising machines have recently shown promise in solving combinatorial optimization problems in a short time. Real-world applications, such as time division multiple access (TDMA) scheduling for wireless multi-hop networks and financial trading, require solving those problems sequentially where the size and characteristics change dynamically. However, using Ising machines involves challenges to shorten system-wide latency due to the transfer of large Ising model or the cloud access and to determine the parameters for each problem. Here we show a combinatorial optimization method using embedded Ising machines, which enables solving diverse problems at high speed without runtime parameter tuning. We customize the algorithm and circuit architecture of the simulated bifurcation-based Ising machine to compress the Ising model and accelerate computation and then built a machine learning model to estimate appropriate parameters using extensive training data. In TDMA scheduling for wireless multi-hop networks, our demonstration has shown that the sophisticated system can adapt to changes in the problem and showed that it has a speed advantage over conventional methods.</description>

      <title>The more the merrier: logical and multistage processors in credit scoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning algorithms are ubiquitous in key decision-making contexts such as organizational justice or healthcare, which has spawned a great demand for fairness in these procedures. In this paper we focus on the application of fair ML in finance, more concretely on the use of fairness techniques on credit scoring. This paper makes two contributions. On the one hand, it addresses the existent gap concerning the application of established methods in the literature to the case of multiple sensitive variables through the use of a new technique called logical processors (LP). On the other hand, it also explores the novel method of multistage processors (MP) to investigate whether the combination of fairness methods can work synergistically to produce solutions with improved fairness or accuracy. Furthermore, we examine the intersection of these two lines of research by exploring the integration of fairness methods in the multivariate case. The results are very promising and suggest that logical processors are an appropriate way of handling multiple sensitive variables. Furthermore, multistage processors are capable of improving the performance of existing methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Nets as Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters. Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.</description>

Abstract: Learning physics simulations from video data requires maintaining spatial and temporal consistency, a challenge often addressed with strong inductive biases or ground-truth 3D information -- limiting scalability and generalization. We introduce 3DGSim, a 3D physics simulator that learns object dynamics end-to-end from multi-view RGB videos. It encodes images into a 3D Gaussian particle representation, propagates dynamics via a transformer, and renders frames using 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly training inverse rendering with a dynamics transformer using a temporal encoding and merging layer, 3DGSimembeds physical properties into point-wise latent vectors without enforcing explicit connectivity constraints. This enables the model to capture diverse physical behaviors, from rigid to elastic and cloth-like interactions, along with realistic lighting effects that also generalize to unseen multi-body interactions and novel scene edits.</description>

      <title>Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation with WordNet-Relaxed Text Embeddings for Robust Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crossmodal knowledge distillation (KD) aims to enhance a unimodal student using a multimodal teacher model. In particular, when the teacher's modalities include the student's, additional complementary information can be exploited to improve knowledge transfer. In supervised image classification, image datasets typically include class labels that represent high-level concepts, suggesting a natural avenue to incorporate textual cues for crossmodal KD. However, these labels rarely capture the deeper semantic structures in real-world visuals and can lead to label leakage if used directly as inputs, ultimately limiting KD performance. To address these issues, we propose a multi-teacher crossmodal KD framework that integrates CLIP image embeddings with learnable WordNet-relaxed text embeddings under a hierarchical loss. By avoiding direct use of exact class names and instead using semantically richer WordNet expansions, we mitigate label leakage and introduce more diverse textual cues. Experiments show that this strategy significantly boosts student performance, whereas noisy or overly precise text embeddings hinder distillation efficiency. Interpretability analyses confirm that WordNet-relaxed prompts encourage heavier reliance on visual features over textual shortcuts, while still effectively incorporating the newly introduced textual cues. Our method achieves state-of-the-art or second-best results on six public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing crossmodal KD.</description>

      <title>AutoML Algorithms for Online Generalized Additive Model Selection: Application to Electricity Demand Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity demand forecasting is key to ensuring that supply meets demand lest the grid would blackout. Reliable short-term forecasts may be obtained by combining a Generalized Additive Models (GAM) with a State-Space model (Obst et al., 2021), leading to an adaptive (or online) model. A GAM is an over-parameterized linear model defined by a formula and a state-space model involves hyperparameters. Both the formula and adaptation parameters have to be fixed before model training and have a huge impact on the model's predictive performance. We propose optimizing them using the DRAGON package of Keisler (2025), originally designed for neural architecture search. This work generalizes it for automated online generalized additive model selection by defining an efficient modeling of the search space (namely, the space of the GAM formulae and adaptation parameters). Its application to short-term French electricity demand forecasting demonstrates the relevance of the approach</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collecting high-quality training data is essential for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). However, acquiring such data is often costly and time-consuming, especially for non-English languages such as Italian. Recently, researchers have begun to explore the use of LLMs to generate synthetic datasets as a viable alternative. This study proposes a pipeline for generating synthetic data and a comprehensive approach for investigating the factors that influence the validity of synthetic data generated by LLMs by examining how model performance is affected by metrics such as prompt strategy, text length and target position in a specific task, i.e. inclusive language detection in Italian job advertisements. Our results show that, in most cases and across different metrics, the fine-tuned models trained on synthetic data consistently outperformed other models on both real and synthetic test datasets. The study discusses the practical implications and limitations of using synthetic data for language detection tasks with LLMs.</description>

      <title>HACTS: a Human-As-Copilot Teleoperation System for Robot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleoperation is essential for autonomous robot learning, especially in manipulation tasks that require human demonstrations or corrections. However, most existing systems only offer unilateral robot control and lack the ability to synchronize the robot's status with the teleoperation hardware, preventing real-time, flexible intervention. In this work, we introduce HACTS (Human-As-Copilot Teleoperation System), a novel system that establishes bilateral, real-time joint synchronization between a robot arm and teleoperation hardware. This simple yet effective feedback mechanism, akin to a steering wheel in autonomous vehicles, enables the human copilot to intervene seamlessly while collecting action-correction data for future learning. Implemented using 3D-printed components and low-cost, off-the-shelf motors, HACTS is both accessible and scalable. Our experiments show that HACTS significantly enhances performance in imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, boosting IL recovery capabilities and data efficiency, and facilitating human-in-the-loop RL. HACTS paves the way for more effective and interactive human-robot collaboration and data-collection, advancing the capabilities of robot manipulation.</description>

      <title>From Colors to Classes: Emergence of Concepts in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are increasingly utilized in various computer vision tasks due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, it remains understudied how ViTs process information layer by layer. Numerous studies have shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract features of increasing complexity throughout their layers, which is crucial for tasks like domain adaptation and transfer learning. ViTs, lacking the same inductive biases as CNNs, can potentially learn global dependencies from the first layers due to their attention mechanisms. Given the increasing importance of ViTs in computer vision, there is a need to improve the layer-wise understanding of ViTs. In this work, we present a novel, layer-wise analysis of concepts encoded in state-of-the-art ViTs using neuron labeling. Our findings reveal that ViTs encode concepts with increasing complexity throughout the network. Early layers primarily encode basic features such as colors and textures, while later layers represent more specific classes, including objects and animals. As the complexity of encoded concepts increases, the number of concepts represented in each layer also rises, reflecting a more diverse and specific set of features. Additionally, different pretraining strategies influence the quantity and category of encoded concepts, with finetuning to specific downstream tasks generally reducing the number of encoded concepts and shifting the concepts to more relevant categories.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for hidden boundary detection and flow field reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously detecting hidden solid boundaries and reconstructing flow fields from sparse observations poses a significant inverse challenge in fluid mechanics. This study presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework designed to infer the presence, shape, and motion of static or moving solid boundaries within a flow field. By integrating a body fraction parameter into the governing equations, the model enforces no-slip/no-penetration boundary conditions in solid regions while preserving conservation laws of fluid dynamics. Using partial flow field data, the method simultaneously reconstructs the unknown flow field and infers the body fraction distribution, thereby revealing solid boundaries. The framework is validated across diverse scenarios, including incompressible Navier-Stokes and compressible Euler flows, such as steady flow past a fixed cylinder, an inline oscillating cylinder, and subsonic flow over an airfoil. The results demonstrate accurate detection of hidden boundaries, reconstruction of missing flow data, and estimation of trajectories and velocities of a moving body. Further analysis examines the effects of data sparsity, velocity-only measurements, and noise on inference accuracy. The proposed method exhibits robustness and versatility, highlighting its potential for applications when only limited experimental or numerical data are available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new manifold optimization method to solve low-rank problems with sparse simplex constraints (variables are simultaneous nonnegativity, sparsity, and sum-to-1) that are beneficial in applications. The proposed approach exploits oblique rotation manifolds, rewrite the problem, and introduce a new Riemannian optimization method. Experiments on synthetic datasets compared to the standard Euclidean method show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Controlled Latent Diffusion Models for 3D Porous Media Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional digital reconstruction of porous media presents a fundamental challenge in geoscience, requiring simultaneous resolution of fine-scale pore structures while capturing representative elementary volumes. We introduce a computational framework that addresses this challenge through latent diffusion models operating within the EDM framework. Our approach reduces dimensionality via a custom variational autoencoder trained in binary geological volumes, improving efficiency and also enabling the generation of larger volumes than previously possible with diffusion models. A key innovation is our controlled unconditional sampling methodology, which enhances distribution coverage by first sampling target statistics from their empirical distributions, then generating samples conditioned on these values. Extensive testing on four distinct rock types demonstrates that conditioning on porosity - a readily computable statistic - is sufficient to ensure a consistent representation of multiple complex properties, including permeability, two-point correlation functions, and pore size distributions. The framework achieves better generation quality than pixel-space diffusion while enabling significantly larger volume reconstruction (256-cube voxels) with substantially reduced computational requirements, establishing a new state-of-the-art for digital rock physics applications.</description>

      <title>New universal operator approximation theorem for encoder-decoder architectures (Preprint)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the rapidly growing field of mathematics for operator approximation with neural networks, we present a novel universal operator approximation theorem for a broad class of encoder-decoder architectures. In this study, we focus on approximating continuous operators in $\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})$, where $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are infinite-dimensional normed or metric spaces, and we consider uniform convergence on compact subsets of $\mathcal{X}$. Unlike standard results in the operator learning literature, we investigate the case where the approximating operator sequence can be chosen independently of the compact sets. Taking a topological perspective, we analyze different types of operator approximation and show that compact-set-independent approximation is a strictly stronger property in most relevant operator learning frameworks. To establish our results, we introduce a new approximation property tailored to encoder-decoder architectures, which enables us to prove a universal operator approximation theorem ensuring uniform convergence on every compact subset. This result unifies and extends existing universal operator approximation theorems for various encoder-decoder architectures, including classical DeepONets, BasisONets, special cases of MIONets, architectures based on frames and other related approaches.</description>

      <title>Inductive Graph Representation Learning with Quantum Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) present a promising approach for combining quantum computing with graph-structured data processing. While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are renowned for their scalability and robustness, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to a narrower range of graph-structured problems, falling short of real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by the classical GraphSAGE approach, utilizing quantum models as aggregators. In this work, we integrate established techniques for inductive representation learning on graphs with parametrized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, effectively bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, enabling tailored designs for specific problems. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, we demonstrate that our framework successfully models a non-trivial molecular dataset, achieving performance comparable to classical GNNs. In particular, we show that our quantum approach exhibits robust generalization across molecules with varying numbers of atoms without requiring circuit modifications, slightly outperforming classical GNNs. Furthermore, we numerically investigate the scalability of the QGNN framework. Specifically, we demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus in our architecture as the number of qubits increases, suggesting that the proposed quantum model can be extended to handle larger and more complex graph-based problems effectively.</description>

      <title>IMPACT: A Generic Semantic Loss for Multimodal Medical Image Registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image registration is fundamental in medical imaging, enabling precise alignment of anatomical structures for diagnosis, treatment planning, image-guided treatment or longitudinal monitoring. This work introduces IMPACT (Image Metric with Pretrained model-Agnostic Comparison for Transmodality registration), a generic semantic similarity metric designed for seamless integration into diverse image registration frameworks (such as Elastix and Voxelmorph). It compares deep learning-based features extracted from medical images without requiring task-specific training, ensuring broad applicability across various modalities. By leveraging the features of the large-scale pretrained TotalSegmentator models and the ability to integrate Segment Anything Model (SAM) and other large-scale segmentation networks, this approach offers significant advantages. It provides robust, scalable, and efficient solutions for multimodal image registration. The IMPACT loss was evaluated on five challenging registration tasks involving thoracic CT/CBCT, and pelvic MR/CT datasets. Quantitative metrics, such as Target Registration Error and Dice Similarity Coefficient, demonstrated significant improvements in anatomical alignment compared to baseline methods. Qualitative analyses further confirmed the increased robustness of the proposed metric in the face of noise, artifacts, and modality variations. IMPACT's versatility and efficiency make it a valuable tool for advancing registration performance in clinical and research applications, addressing critical challenges in multimodal medical imaging.</description>

      <title>It's a (Blind) Match! Towards Vision-Language Correspondence without Parallel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The platonic representation hypothesis suggests that vision and language embeddings become more homogeneous as model and dataset sizes increase. In particular, pairwise distances within each modality become more similar. This suggests that as foundation models mature, it may become possible to match vision and language embeddings in a fully unsupervised fashion, i.e. without parallel data. We present the first feasibility study, and investigate conformity of existing vision and language foundation models in the context of unsupervised, or "blind", matching. First, we formulate unsupervised matching as a quadratic assignment problem and introduce a novel heuristic that outperforms previous solvers. We also develop a technique to find optimal matching problems, for which a non-trivial match is very likely. Second, we conduct an extensive study deploying a range of vision and language models on four datasets. Our analysis reveals that for many problem instances, vision and language representations can be indeed matched without supervision. This finding opens up the exciting possibility of embedding semantic knowledge into other modalities virtually annotation-free. As a proof of concept, we showcase an unsupervised classifier, which achieves non-trivial classification accuracy without any image-text annotation.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Predictive Modeling for Robotic Plaster Printing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) modeling approach to predict the resulting surface from a particle based fabrication process. The latter consists of spray-based printing of cementitious plaster on a wall and is facilitated with the use of a robotic arm. The predictions are computed using the robotic arm trajectory features, such as position, velocity and direction, as well as the printing process parameters. The proposed approach, based on a particle representation of the wall domain and the end effector, allows for the adoption of a graph-based solution. The GNN model consists of an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and is trained using data from laboratory tests, while the hyperparameters are optimized by means of a Bayesian scheme. The aim of this model is to act as a simulator of the printing process, and ultimately used for the generation of the robotic arm trajectory and the optimization of the printing parameters, towards the materialization of an autonomous plastering process. The performance of the proposed model is assessed in terms of the prediction error against unseen ground truth data, which shows its generality in varied scenarios, as well as in comparison with the performance of an existing benchmark model. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the benchmark model, with notably better performance and enhanced error scaling across prediction steps.</description>

      <title>Traffic Engineering in Large-scale Networks with Generalizable Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic engineering (TE) in large-scale computer networks has become a fundamental yet challenging problem, owing to the swift growth of global-scale cloud wide-area networks or backbone low-Earth-orbit satellite constellations. To address the scalability issue of traditional TE algorithms, learning-based approaches have been proposed, showing potential of significant efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Nevertheless, the intrinsic limitations of existing learning-based methods hinder their practical application: they are not generalizable across diverse topologies and network conditions, incur excessive training overhead, and do not respect link capacities by default.
  This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE problems efficiently in large-scale networks, while achieving superior generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution" into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact network topology or traffic patterns, and can efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands.
  We trained and evaluated TELGEN on random and real-world networks with up to 5000 nodes and 106 links. TELGEN achieved less than 3% optimality gap while ensuring feasibility in all cases, even when the test network had up to 20x more nodes than the largest in training. It also saved up to 84% solving time than classical optimal solver, and could reduce training time per epoch and solving time by 2-4 orders of magnitude than latest learning algorithms on the largest networks.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition Algorithms for Thermal-Hydraulics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, algorithms aiming at learning models from available data have become quite popular due to two factors: 1) the significant developments in Artificial Intelligence techniques and 2) the availability of large amounts of data. Nevertheless, this topic has already been addressed by methodologies belonging to the Reduced Order Modelling framework, of which perhaps the most famous equation-free technique is Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This algorithm aims to learn the best linear model that represents the physical phenomena described by a time series dataset: its output is a best state operator of the underlying dynamical system that can be used, in principle, to advance the original dataset in time even beyond its span. However, in its standard formulation, this technique cannot deal with parametric time series, meaning that a different linear model has to be derived for each parameter realization. Research on this is ongoing, and some versions of a parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition already exist. This work contributes to this research field by comparing the different algorithms presently deployed and assessing their advantages and shortcomings compared to each other. To this aim, three different thermal-hydraulics problems are considered: two benchmark 'flow over cylinder' test cases at diverse Reynolds numbers, whose datasets are, respectively, obtained with the FEniCS finite element solver and retrieved from the CFDbench dataset, and the DYNASTY experimental facility operating at Politecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by internally heated fluids for Generation IV nuclear applications, whose dataset was generated using the RELAP5 nodal solver.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach to learn a generalized kinetic collision operator directly from molecular dynamics. Unlike the conventional (e.g., Landau) models, the present operator takes an anisotropic form that accounts for a second energy transfer arising from the collective interactions between the pair of collision particles and the environment. Numerical results show that preserving the broadly overlooked anisotropic nature of the collision energy transfer is crucial for predicting the plasma kinetics with non-negligible correlations, where the Landau model shows limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework that integrates object detection (OD) and visual grounding (VG) for remote sensing (RS) imagery. To support conventional OD and establish an intuitive prior for VG task, we fine-tune an open-set object detector using referring expression data, framing it as a partially supervised OD task. In the first stage, we construct a graph representation of each image, comprising object queries, class embeddings, and proposal locations. Then, our task-aware architecture processes this graph to perform the VG task. The model consists of: (i) a multi-branch network that integrates spatial, visual, and categorical features to generate task-aware proposals, and (ii) an object reasoning network that assigns probabilities across proposals, followed by a soft selection mechanism for final referring object localization. Our model demonstrates superior performance on the OPT-RSVG and DIOR-RSVG datasets, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while retaining classical OD capabilities. The code will be available in our repository: \url{https://github.com/rd20karim/MB-ORES}.</description>

Abstract: Compute nodes on modern heterogeneous supercomputing systems comprise CPUs, GPUs, and high-speed network interconnects (NICs). Parallelization is identified as a technique for effectively utilizing these systems to execute scalable simulation and deep learning workloads. The resulting inter-process communication from the distributed execution of these parallel workloads is one of the key factors contributing to its performance bottleneck. Most programming models and runtime systems enabling the communication requirements on these systems support GPU-aware communication schemes that move the GPU-attached communication buffers in the application directly from the GPU to the NIC without staging through the host memory. A CPU thread is required to orchestrate the communication operations even with support for such GPU-awareness. This survey discusses various available GPU-centric communication schemes that move the control path of the communication operations from the CPU to the GPU. This work presents the need for the new communication schemes, various GPU and NIC capabilities required to implement the schemes, and the potential use-cases addressed. Based on these discussions, challenges involved in supporting the exhibited GPU-centric communication schemes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Image Resolution of Solar Magnetograms: A Latent Diffusion Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial properties of the solar magnetic field are crucial to decoding the physical processes in the solar interior and their interplanetary effects. However, observations from older instruments, such as the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), have limited spatial or temporal resolution, which hinders the ability to study small-scale solar features in detail. Super resolving these older datasets is essential for uniform analysis across different solar cycles, enabling better characterization of solar flares, active regions, and magnetic network dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion model approach for Super-Resolution and we apply it to MDI magnetograms to match the higher-resolution capabilities of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). By training a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with residuals on downscaled HMI data and fine-tuning it with paired MDI/HMI data, we can enhance the resolution of MDI observations from 2"/pixel to 0.5"/pixel. We evaluate the quality of the reconstructed images by means of classical metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, FID and LPIPS) and we check if physical properties, such as the unsigned magnetic flux or the size of an active region, are preserved. We compare our model with different variations of LDM and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models (DDPMs), but also with two deterministic architectures already used in the past for performing the Super-Resolution task. Furthermore, we show with an analysis in the Fourier domain that the LDM with residuals can resolve features smaller than 2", and due to the probabilistic nature of the LDM, we can asses their reliability, in contrast with the deterministic models. Future studies aim to super-resolve the temporal scale of the solar MDI instrument so that we can also have a better overview of the dynamics of the old events.</description>

      <title>Learning Velocity and Acceleration: Self-Supervised Motion Consistency for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human motion is crucial for accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction. Conventional methods typically rely on supervised learning, where ground-truth labels are directly optimized against predicted trajectories. This amplifies the limitations caused by long-tailed data distributions, making it difficult for the model to capture abnormal behaviors. In this work, we propose a self-supervised pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that explicitly models position, velocity, and acceleration. We leverage velocity and acceleration information to enhance position prediction through feature injection and a self-supervised motion consistency mechanism. Our model hierarchically injects velocity features into the position stream. Acceleration features are injected into the velocity stream. This enables the model to predict position, velocity, and acceleration jointly. From the predicted position, we compute corresponding pseudo velocity and acceleration, allowing the model to learn from data-generated pseudo labels and thus achieve self-supervised learning. We further design a motion consistency evaluation strategy grounded in physical principles; it selects the most reasonable predicted motion trend by comparing it with historical dynamics and uses this trend to guide and constrain trajectory generation. We conduct experiments on the ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</description>

      <title>Fair Dynamic Spectrum Access via Fully Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a decentralized wireless network with several source-destination pairs sharing a limited number of orthogonal frequency bands. Sources learn to adapt their transmissions (specifically, their band selection strategy) over time, in a decentralized manner, without sharing information with each other. Sources can only observe the outcome of their own transmissions (i.e., success or collision), having no prior knowledge of the network size or of the transmission strategy of other sources. The goal of each source is to maximize their own throughput while striving for network-wide fairness. We propose a novel fully decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based solution that achieves fairness without coordination. The proposed Fair Share RL (FSRL) solution combines: (i) state augmentation with a semi-adaptive time reference; (ii) an architecture that leverages risk control and time difference likelihood; and (iii) a fairness-driven reward structure. We evaluate FSRL in more than 50 network settings with different number of agents, different amounts of available spectrum, in the presence of jammers, and in an ad-hoc setting. Simulation results suggest that, when we compare FSRL with a common baseline RL algorithm from the literature, FSRL can be up to 89.0% fairer (as measured by Jain's fairness index) in stringent settings with several sources and a single frequency band, and 48.1% fairer on average.</description>

      <title>Solving the Best Subset Selection Problem via Suboptimal Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Best subset selection in linear regression is well known to be nonconvex and computationally challenging to solve, as the number of possible subsets grows rapidly with increasing dimensionality of the problem. As a result, finding the global optimal solution via an exact optimization method for a problem with dimensions of 1000s may take an impractical amount of CPU time. This suggests the importance of finding suboptimal procedures that can provide good approximate solutions using much less computational effort than exact methods. In this work, we introduce a new procedure and compare it with other popular suboptimal algorithms to solve the best subset selection problem. Extensive computational experiments using synthetic and real data have been performed. The results provide insights into the performance of these methods in different data settings. The new procedure is observed to be a competitive suboptimal algorithm for solving the best subset selection problem for high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Evaluation of LLM Strategies for Mental Health Text Analysis: Fine-tuning vs. Prompt Engineering vs. RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a systematic comparison of three approaches for the analysis of mental health text using large language models (LLMs): prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. Using LLaMA 3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.</description>

      <title>Sample-Optimal Private Regression in Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of privately obtaining prediction error guarantees in ordinary least-squares regression problems with Gaussian covariates (with unknown covariance structure). We provide the first sample-optimal polynomial time algorithm for this task under both pure and approximate differential privacy. We show that any improvement to the sample complexity of our algorithm would violate either statistical-query or information-theoretic lower bounds. Additionally, our algorithm is robust to a small fraction of arbitrary outliers and achieves optimal error rates as a function of the fraction of outliers. In contrast, all prior efficient algorithms either incurred sample complexities with sub-optimal dimension dependence, scaling with the condition number of the covariates, or obtained a polynomially worse dependence on the privacy parameters.
  Our technical contributions are two-fold: first, we leverage resilience guarantees of Gaussians within the sum-of-squares framework. As a consequence, we obtain efficient sum-of-squares algorithms for regression with optimal robustness rates and sample complexity. Second, we generalize the recent robustness-to-privacy framework [HKMN23, (arXiv:2212.05015)] to account for the geometry induced by the covariance of the input samples. This framework crucially relies on the robust estimators to be sum-of-squares algorithms, and combining the two steps yields a sample-optimal private regression algorithm. We believe our techniques are of independent interest, and we demonstrate this by obtaining an efficient algorithm for covariance-aware mean estimation, with an optimal dependence on the privacy parameters.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Pretraining for Aerial Road Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks for aerial image segmentation require large amounts of labeled data, but high-quality aerial datasets with precise annotations are scarce and costly to produce. To address this limitation, we propose a self-supervised pretraining method that improves segmentation performance while reducing reliance on labeled data. Our approach uses inpainting-based pretraining, where the model learns to reconstruct missing regions in aerial images, capturing their inherent structure before being fine-tuned for road extraction. This method improves generalization, enhances robustness to domain shifts, and is invariant to model architecture and dataset choice. Experiments show that our pretraining significantly boosts segmentation accuracy, especially in low-data regimes, making it a scalable solution for aerial image analysis.</description>

      <title>Contextual Preference Collaborative Measure Framework Based on Belief System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reduce the human intervention in the preference measure process,this article proposes a preference collaborative measure framework based on an updated belief system,which is also capable of improving the accuracy and efficiency of preferen-ce measure algorithms.Firstly,the distance of rules and the average internal distance of rulesets are proposed for specifying the relationship between the rules.For discovering the most representative preferences that are common in all users,namely common preference,a algorithm based on average internal distance of ruleset,PRA algorithm,is proposed,which aims to finish the discoveryprocess with minimum information loss rate.Furthermore,the concept of Common belief is proposed to update the belief system,and the common preferences are the evidences of updated belief system.Then,under the belief system,the proposed belief degree and deviation degree are used to determine whether a rule confirms the belief system or not and classify the preference rules into two kinds(generalized or personalized),and eventually filters out Top-K interesting rules relying on belief degree and deviation degree.Based on above,a scalable interestingness calculation framework that can apply various formulas is proposed for accurately calculating interestingness in different conditions.At last,IMCos algorithm and IMCov algorithm are proposed as exemplars to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the framework by using weighted cosine similarity and correlation coefficients as belief degree.In experiments,the proposed algorithms are compared to two state-of-the-art algorithms and the results show that IMCos and IMCov outperform than the other two in most aspects.</description>

      <title>Faster Rates for No-Regret Learning in General Games via Cautious Optimism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the first uncoupled learning algorithm that attains $O(n \log^2 d \log T)$ per-player regret in multi-player general-sum games, where $n$ is the number of players, $d$ is the number of actions available to each player, and $T$ is the number of repetitions of the game. Our results exponentially improve the dependence on $d$ compared to the $O(n\, d \log T)$ regret attainable by Log-Regularized Lifted Optimistic FTRL [Far+22c], and also reduce the dependence on the number of iterations $T$ from $\log^4 T$ to $\log T$ compared to Optimistic Hedge, the previously well-studied algorithm with $O(n \log d \log^4 T)$ regret [DFG21]. Our algorithm is obtained by combining the classic Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update (OMWU) with an adaptive, non-monotonic learning rate that paces the learning process of the players, making them more cautious when their regret becomes too negative.</description>

      <title>Sim-and-Real Co-Training: A Simple Recipe for Vision-Based Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist robot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing large-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and automated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior datasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it to the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality gap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of simulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown this strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one trained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community lacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes to reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work presents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve vision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from comprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various simulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a humanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance real-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences between the simulation and real-world data.

      <title>Policy Gradient for LQR with Domain Randomization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain randomization (DR) enables sim-to-real transfer by training controllers on a distribution of simulated environments, with the goal of achieving robust performance in the real world. Although DR is widely used in practice and is often solved using simple policy gradient (PG) methods, understanding of its theoretical guarantees remains limited. Toward addressing this gap, we provide the first convergence analysis of PG methods for domain-randomized linear quadratic regulation (LQR). We show that PG converges globally to the minimizer of a finite-sample approximation of the DR objective under suitable bounds on the heterogeneity of the sampled systems. We also quantify the sample-complexity associated with achieving a small performance gap between the sample-average and population-level objectives. Additionally, we propose and analyze a discount-factor annealing algorithm that obviates the need for an initial jointly stabilizing controller, which may be challenging to find. Empirical results support our theoretical findings and highlight promising directions for future work, including risk-sensitive DR formulations and stochastic PG algorithms.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effect of Reinforcement Learning on Video Understanding: Insights from SEED-Bench-R1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Chain of Thought (COT) generation have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as an effective post-training approach. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We identify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual cues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling, and RL robustness against noisy signals.</description>

      <title>UniOcc: A Unified Benchmark for Occupancy Forecasting and Prediction in Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce UniOcc, a comprehensive, unified benchmark for occupancy forecasting (i.e., predicting future occupancies based on historical information) and current-frame occupancy prediction from camera images. UniOcc unifies data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and high-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), which provides 2D/3D occupancy labels with per-voxel flow annotations and support for cooperative autonomous driving. In terms of evaluation, unlike existing studies that rely on suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel metrics that do not depend on ground-truth occupancy, enabling robust assessment of additional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data and explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and forecasting performance.</description>

Abstract: Reasoning before action and imagining potential outcomes (i.e., world models) are essential for embodied agents operating in complex open-world environments. Yet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an end-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent system, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy. Thus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination in an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end manner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches the content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from existing agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation explicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and dynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\times$ sample efficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works. During inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential action, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance to review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions. Experimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not only improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of generalist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall performance.</description>

      <title>I Know Therefore I Score: Label-Free Crafting of Scoring Functions using Constraints Based on Domain Expertise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several real-life applications require crafting concise, quantitative scoring functions (also called rating systems) from measured observations. For example, an effectiveness score needs to be created for advertising campaigns using a number of engagement metrics. Experts often need to create such scoring functions in the absence of labelled data, where the scores need to reflect business insights and rules as understood by the domain experts. Without a way to capture these inputs systematically, this becomes a time-consuming process involving trial and error. In this paper, we introduce a label-free practical approach to learn a scoring function from multi-dimensional numerical data. The approach incorporates insights and business rules from domain experts in the form of easily observable and specifiable constraints, which are used as weak supervision by a machine learning model. We convert such constraints into loss functions that are optimized simultaneously while learning the scoring function. We examine the efficacy of the approach using a synthetic dataset as well as four real-life datasets, and also compare how it performs vis-a-vis supervised learning models.</description>

      <title>APTx: better activation function than MISH, SWISH, and ReLU's variants used in deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06119v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activation Functions introduce non-linearity in the deep neural networks. This nonlinearity helps the neural networks learn faster and efficiently from the dataset. In deep learning, many activation functions are developed and used based on the type of problem statement. ReLU's variants, SWISH, and MISH are goto activation functions. MISH function is considered having similar or even better performance than SWISH, and much better than ReLU. In this paper, we propose an activation function named APTx which behaves similar to MISH, but requires lesser mathematical operations to compute. The lesser computational requirements of APTx does speed up the model training, and thus also reduces the hardware requirement for the deep learning model.

      <title>Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM): An Exact Analysis Tool for Deep-Learned Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used in robotics as policies, state transition models, state estimation models, or all of the above. With these components being learned from data, it is important to be able to analyze what behaviors were learned and how this affects closed-loop performance. In this paper we take steps toward this goal by developing methods for computing control invariant sets and regions of attraction (ROAs) of dynamical systems represented as neural networks. We focus our attention on feedforward neural networks with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, which are known to implement continuous piecewise-affine (PWA) functions. We describe the Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM) algorithm for enumerating the affine pieces of a neural network through an incremental connected walk. We then use this algorithm to compute exact forward and backward reachable sets, from which we provide methods for computing control invariant sets and ROAs. Our approach is unique in that we find these sets incrementally, without Lyapunov-based tools. In our examples we demonstrate the ability of our approach to find non-convex control invariant sets and ROAs on tasks with learned van der Pol oscillator and pendulum models. Further, we provide an accelerated algorithm for computing ROAs that leverages the incremental and connected enumeration of affine regions that RPM provides. We show this acceleration to lead to a 15x speedup in our examples. Finally, we apply our methods to find a set of states that are stabilized by an image-based controller for an aircraft runway control problem.</description>

      <title>Dark patterns in e-commerce: a dataset and its baseline evaluations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark patterns, which are user interface designs in online services, induce users to take unintended actions. Recently, dark patterns have been raised as an issue of privacy and fairness. Thus, a wide range of research on detecting dark patterns is eagerly awaited. In this work, we constructed a dataset for dark pattern detection and prepared its baseline detection performance with state-of-the-art machine learning methods. The original dataset was obtained from Mathur et al.'s study in 2019, which consists of 1,818 dark pattern texts from shopping sites. Then, we added negative samples, i.e., non-dark pattern texts, by retrieving texts from the same websites as Mathur et al.'s dataset. We also applied state-of-the-art machine learning methods to show the automatic detection accuracy as baselines, including BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, and XLNet. As a result of 5-fold cross-validation, we achieved the highest accuracy of 0.975 with RoBERTa. The dataset and baseline source codes are available at https://github.com/yamanalab/ec-darkpattern.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Few-shot Learning with Online Attribute Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) presents a challenging learning problem in which only a few samples are available for each class. Decision interpretation is more important in few-shot classification due to a greater chance of error compared to traditional classification. However, the majority of the previous FSL methods are black-box models. In this paper, we propose an inherently interpretable model for FSL based on human-friendly attributes. Previously, human-friendly attributes have been utilized to train models with the potential for human interaction and interpretability. However, such approaches are not directly extendible to the few-shot classification scenario. Moreover, we propose an online attribute selection mechanism to effectively filter out irrelevant attributes in each episode. The attribute selection mechanism improves accuracy and helps with interpretability by reducing the number of attributes that participate in each episode. We further propose a mechanism that automatically detects the episodes where the pool of available human-friendly attributes is insufficient, and subsequently augments it by engaging some learned unknown attributes. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results on par with black-box few-shot learning models on four widely used datasets. We also empirically evaluate the level of decision alignment between different models and human understanding and show that our model outperforms the comparison methods based on this criterion.</description>

      <title>Online Reinforcement Learning in Non-Stationary Context-Driven Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study online reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary environments, where a time-varying exogenous context process affects the environment dynamics. Online RL is challenging in such environments due to "catastrophic forgetting" (CF). The agent tends to forget prior knowledge as it trains on new experiences. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue assume task labels (which are often not available in practice), employ brittle regularization heuristics, or use off-policy methods that suffer from instability and poor performance.
  We present Locally Constrained Policy Optimization (LCPO), an online RL approach that combats CF by anchoring policy outputs on old experiences while optimizing the return on current experiences. To perform this anchoring, LCPO locally constrains policy optimization using samples from experiences that lie outside of the current context distribution. We evaluate LCPO in Mujoco, classic control and computer systems environments with a variety of synthetic and real context traces, and find that it outperforms a variety of baselines in the non-stationary setting, while achieving results on-par with a "prescient" agent trained offline across all context traces.
  LCPO's source code is available at https://github.com/pouyahmdn/LCPO.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Robust Learning with Optimal Transport Regularized Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of optimal-transport-regularized divergences, $D^c$, constructed via an infimal convolution between an information divergence, $D$, and an optimal-transport (OT) cost, $C$, and study their use in distributionally robust optimization (DRO). In particular, we propose the $ARMOR_D$ methods as novel approaches to enhancing the adversarial robustness of deep learning models. These DRO-based methods are defined by minimizing the maximum expected loss over a $D^c$-neighborhood of the empirical distribution of the training data. Viewed as a tool for constructing adversarial samples, our method allows samples to be both transported, according to the OT cost, and re-weighted, according to the information divergence; the addition of a principled and dynamical adversarial re-weighting on top of adversarial sample transport is a key innovation of $ARMOR_D$. $ARMOR_D$ can be viewed as a generalization of the best-performing loss functions and OT costs in the adversarial training literature; we demonstrate this flexibility by using $ARMOR_D$ to augment the UDR, TRADES, and MART methods and obtain improved performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image recognition. Specifically, augmenting with $ARMOR_D$ leads to 1.9\% and 2.1\% improvement against AutoAttack, a powerful ensemble of adversarial attacks, on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 respectively. To foster reproducibility, we made the code accessible at https://github.com/star-ailab/ARMOR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we enhance the node features acquired from Pretrained Models (PMs) to better suit downstream graph learning tasks? Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art approach for many high-impact, real-world graph applications. For feature-rich graphs, a prevalent practice involves utilizing a PM directly to generate features, without incorporating any domain adaptation techniques. Nevertheless, this practice is suboptimal because the node features extracted from PM are graph-agnostic and prevent GNNs from fully utilizing the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features, leading to a decline in GNNs performance. In this work, we seek to improve the node features obtained from a PM for downstream graph tasks and introduce TOUCHUP-G, which has several advantages. It is (a) General: applicable to any downstream graph task, including link prediction which is often employed in recommender systems; (b) Multi-modal: able to improve raw features of any modality (e.g. images, texts, audio); (c) Principled: it is closely related to a novel metric, feature homophily, which we propose to quantify the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features and we show that TOUCHUP-G can effectively shrink the discrepancy between the graph structure and node features; (d) Effective: achieving state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets spanning different tasks and modalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose both serial and parallel proximal (linearized) alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithms for training residual neural networks. In contrast to backpropagation-based approaches, our methods inherently mitigate the exploding gradient issue and are well-suited for parallel and distributed training through regional updates. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed algorithms converge at an R-linear (sublinear) rate for both the iteration points and the objective function values. These results hold without imposing stringent constraints on network width, depth, or training data size. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze our parallel/distributed ADMM algorithms, highlighting their reduced time complexity and lower per-node memory consumption. To facilitate practical deployment, we develop a control protocol for parallel ADMM implementation using Python's multiprocessing and interprocess communication. Experimental results validate the proposed ADMM algorithms, demonstrating rapid and stable convergence, improved performance, and high computational efficiency. Finally, we highlight the improved scalability and efficiency achieved by our parallel ADMM training strategy.</description>

      <title>Integrating Fairness and Model Pruning Through Bi-level Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved exceptional results across a range of applications. As the demand for efficient and sparse deep learning models escalates, the significance of model compression, particularly pruning, is increasingly recognized. Traditional pruning methods, however, can unintentionally intensify algorithmic biases, leading to unequal prediction outcomes in critical applications and raising concerns about the dilemma of pruning practices and social justice. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel concept of fair model pruning, which involves developing a sparse model that adheres to fairness criteria. In particular, we propose a framework to jointly optimize the pruning mask and weight update processes with fairness constraints. This framework is engineered to compress models that maintain performance while ensuring fairness in a unified process. To this end, we formulate the fair pruning problem as a novel constrained bi-level optimization task and derive efficient and effective solving strategies. We design experiments across various datasets and scenarios to validate our proposed method. Our empirical analysis contrasts our framework with several mainstream pruning strategies, emphasizing our method's superiority in maintaining model fairness, performance, and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15960v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive capabilities in handling straightforward programming tasks. However, their performance tends to falter when confronted with more challenging programming problems. We observe that conventional models often generate solutions as monolithic code blocks, restricting their effectiveness in tackling intricate questions. To overcome this limitation, we present Module-of-Thought Coder (MoTCoder). We introduce a framework for MoT instruction tuning, designed to promote the decomposition of tasks into logical sub-tasks and sub-modules. Our investigations reveal that, through the cultivation and utilization of sub-modules, MoTCoder significantly improves both the modularity and correctness of the generated solutions, leading to substantial pass@1 improvements of 5.9% on APPS and 5.8% on CodeContests. MoTCoder also achieved significant improvements in self-correction capabilities, surpassing the current SOTA by 3.3%. Additionally, we provide an analysis of between problem complexity and optimal module decomposition and evaluate the maintainability index, confirming that the code generated by MoTCoder is easier to understand and modify, which can be beneficial for long-term code maintenance and evolution. Our codes are available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/MoTCoder.</description>

      <title>Model Selection for Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Structural Risk Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) usually assumes the reward function model is pre-specified as a weighted sum of features and estimates the weighting parameters only. However, how to select features and determine a proper reward model is nontrivial and experience-dependent. A simplistic model is less likely to contain the ideal reward function, while a model with high complexity leads to substantial computation cost and potential overfitting. This paper addresses this trade-off in the model selection for IRL problems by introducing the structural risk minimization (SRM) framework from statistical learning. SRM selects an optimal reward function class from a hypothesis set minimizing both estimation error and model complexity. To formulate an SRM scheme for IRL, we estimate the policy gradient from given demonstration as the empirical risk, and establish the upper bound of Rademacher complexity as the model penalty of hypothesis function classes. The SRM learning guarantee is further presented. In particular, we provide the explicit form for the linear weighted sum setting. Simulations demonstrate the performance and efficiency of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Sample, estimate, aggregate: A recipe for causal discovery foundation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal discovery, the task of inferring causal structure from data, has the potential to uncover mechanistic insights from biological experiments, especially those involving perturbations. However, causal discovery algorithms over larger sets of variables tend to be brittle against misspecification or when data are limited. For example, single-cell transcriptomics measures thousands of genes, but the nature of their relationships is not known, and there may be as few as tens of cells per intervention setting. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a foundation model-inspired approach: a supervised model trained on large-scale, synthetic data to predict causal graphs from summary statistics -- like the outputs of classical causal discovery algorithms run over subsets of variables and other statistical hints like inverse covariance. Our approach is enabled by the observation that typical errors in the outputs of a discovery algorithm remain comparable across datasets. Theoretically, we show that the model architecture is well-specified, in the sense that it can recover a causal graph consistent with graphs over subsets. Empirically, we train the model to be robust to misspecification and distribution shift using diverse datasets. Experiments on biological and synthetic data confirm that this model generalizes well beyond its training set, runs on graphs with hundreds of variables in seconds, and can be easily adapted to different underlying data assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We study the fundamental optimization principles of self-attention, the defining mechanism of transformers, by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient-based optimizers in training a self-attention layer with a linear decoder in binary classification. Building on prior studies in linear logistic regression, recent findings demonstrate that the key-query matrix $W_t$ from gradient-descent (GD) converges in direction towards $W_{mm}$, which maximizes the margin between optimal and non-optimal tokens across sequences. However, this convergence is local, dependent on initial conditions, only holds asymptotically as the number of iterations increases, and leaves questions about the potential benefits of adaptive step-size rules unaddressed. To bridge this gap, we first establish scenarios for which convergence is provably \emph{global}. We then analyze two adaptive step-size strategies: normalized GD and Polyak step-size, demonstrating \emph{finite-time} convergence rates for $W_t$ to $W_{mm}$, and quantifying the sparsification rate of the attention map. These findings not only show that these strategies can accelerate parameter convergence over standard GD in a non-convex setting but also deepen the understanding of the implicit bias in self-attention, linking it more closely to the phenomena observed in linear logistic regression despite its intricate non-convex nature.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Smoothing: A Scalable Approach to Randomized Smoothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized smoothing has emerged as a potent certifiable defense against adversarial attacks by employing smoothing noises from specific distributions to ensure the robustness of a smoothed classifier. However, the utilization of Monte Carlo sampling in this process introduces a compute-intensive element, which constrains the practicality of randomized smoothing on a larger scale. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that replaces Monte Carlo sampling with the training of a surrogate neural network. Through extensive experimentation in various settings, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in approximating the smoothed classifier with remarkable precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates the robust radius certification process, providing nearly $600$X improvement in computation time, overcoming the computational bottlenecks associated with traditional randomized smoothing.</description>

      <title>TimeCMA: Towards LLM-Empowered Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Cross-Modality Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01638v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) aims to learn temporal dynamics among variables to forecast future time series. Existing statistical and deep learning-based methods suffer from limited learnable parameters and small-scale training data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) combining time series with textual prompts have achieved promising performance in MTSF. However, we discovered that current LLM-based solutions fall short in learning disentangled embeddings. We introduce TimeCMA, an intuitive yet effective framework for MTSF via cross-modality alignment. Specifically, we present a dual-modality encoding with two branches: the time series encoding branch extracts disentangled yet weak time series embeddings, and the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series with text as prompts to obtain entangled yet robust prompt embeddings. As a result, such a cross-modality alignment retrieves both disentangled and robust time series embeddings, "the best of two worlds", from the prompt embeddings based on time series and prompt modality similarities. As another key design, to reduce the computational costs from time series with their length textual prompts, we design an effective prompt to encourage the most essential temporal information to be encapsulated in the last token: only the last token is passed to downstream prediction. We further store the last token embeddings to accelerate inference speed. Extensive experiments on eight real datasets demonstrate that TimeCMA outperforms state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Reinforced Planning with Large Language Models for Drug Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of drug discovery is to identify chemical compounds that possess specific pharmaceutical properties toward a binding target. Existing large language models (LLMS) can achieve high token matching scores in terms of likelihood for molecule generation. However, relying solely on LLM decoding often results in the generation of molecules that are either invalid due to a single misused token, or suboptimal due to unbalanced exploration and exploitation as a consequence of the LLMs prior experience. Here we propose ERP, Entropy-Reinforced Planning for Transformer Decoding, which employs an entropy-reinforced planning algorithm to enhance the Transformer decoding process and strike a balance between exploitation and exploration. ERP aims to achieve improvements in multiple properties compared to direct sampling from the Transformer. We evaluated ERP on the SARS-CoV-2 virus (3CLPro) and human cancer cell target protein (RTCB) benchmarks and demonstrated that, in both benchmarks, ERP consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithm by 1-5 percent, and baselines by 5-10 percent, respectively. Moreover, such improvement is robust across Transformer models trained with different objectives. Finally, to further illustrate the capabilities of ERP, we tested our algorithm on three code generation benchmarks and outperformed the current state-of-the-art approach as well. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/xuefeng-cs/ERP.</description>

Abstract: Graph machine learning has made significant strides in recent years, yet the integration of visual information with graph structure and its potential for improving performance in downstream tasks remains an underexplored area. To address this critical gap, we introduce the Multimodal Graph Benchmark (MM-GRAPH), a pioneering benchmark that incorporates both visual and textual information into graph learning tasks. MM-GRAPH extends beyond existing text-attributed graph benchmarks, offering a more comprehensive evaluation framework for multimodal graph learning Our benchmark comprises seven diverse datasets of varying scales (ranging from thousands to millions of edges), designed to assess algorithms across different tasks in real-world scenarios. These datasets feature rich multimodal node attributes, including visual data, which enables a more holistic evaluation of various graph learning frameworks in complex, multimodal environments. To support advancements in this emerging field, we provide an extensive empirical study on various graph learning frameworks when presented with features from multiple modalities, particularly emphasizing the impact of visual information. This study offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of integrating visual data into graph learning.</description>

      <title>Sustainable techniques to improve Data Quality for training image-based explanatory models for Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual explanations based on user-uploaded images are an effective and self-contained approach to provide transparency to Recommender Systems (RS), but intrinsic limitations of data used in this explainability paradigm cause existing approaches to use bad quality training data that is highly sparse and suffers from labelling noise. Popular training enrichment approaches like model enlargement or massive data gathering are expensive and environmentally unsustainable, thus we seek to provide better visual explanations to RS aligning with the principles of Responsible AI. In this work, we research the intersection of effective and sustainable training enrichment strategies for visual-based RS explainability models by developing three novel strategies that focus on training Data Quality: 1) selection of reliable negative training examples using Positive-unlabelled Learning, 2) transform-based data augmentation, and 3) text-to-image generative-based data augmentation. The integration of these strategies in three state-of-the-art explainability models increases 5% the performance in relevant ranking metrics of these visual-based RS explainability models without penalizing their practical long-term sustainability, as tested in multiple real-world restaurant recommendation explanation datasets.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Graph Condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11025v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph condensation has recently emerged as a prevalent technique to improve the training efficiency for graph neural networks (GNNs). It condenses a large graph into a small one such that a GNN trained on this small synthetic graph can achieve comparable performance to a GNN trained on the large graph. However, while existing graph condensation studies mainly focus on the best trade-off between graph size and the GNNs' performance (model utility), they overlook the security issues of graph condensation. To bridge this gap, we first explore backdoor attack against the GNNs trained on the condensed graphs.
  We introduce an effective backdoor attack against graph condensation, termed BGC. This attack aims to (1) preserve the condensed graph quality despite trigger injection, and (2) ensure trigger efficacy through the condensation process, achieving a high attack success rate. Specifically, BGC consistently updates triggers during condensation and targets representative nodes for poisoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. BGC achieves a high attack success rate (close to 1.0) and good model utility in all cases. Furthermore, the results against multiple defense methods demonstrate BGC's resilience under their defenses. Finally, we analyze the key hyperparameters that influence the attack performance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/JiahaoWuGit/BGC.</description>

      <title>Krait: A Backdoor Attack Against Graph Prompt Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph prompt tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm to effectively transfer general graph knowledge from pre-trained models to various downstream tasks, particularly in few-shot contexts. However, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where adversaries insert triggers to manipulate outcomes, raises a critical concern. We conduct the first study to investigate such vulnerability, revealing that backdoors can disguise benign graph prompts, thus evading detection. We introduce Krait, a novel graph prompt backdoor. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic metric called label non-uniformity homophily to select poisoned candidates, significantly reducing computational complexity. To accommodate diverse attack scenarios and advanced attack types, we design three customizable trigger generation methods to craft prompts as triggers. We propose a novel centroid similarity-based loss function to optimize prompt tuning for attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiments on four real-world graphs demonstrate that Krait can efficiently embed triggers to merely 0.15% to 2% of training nodes, achieving high attack success rates without sacrificing clean accuracy. Notably, in one-to-one and all-to-one attacks, Krait can achieve 100% attack success rates by poisoning as few as 2 and 22 nodes, respectively. Our experiments further show that Krait remains potent across different transfer cases, attack types, and graph neural network backbones. Additionally, Krait can be successfully extended to the black-box setting, posing more severe threats. Finally, we analyze why Krait can evade both classical and state-of-the-art defenses, and provide practical insights for detecting and mitigating this class of attacks.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</description>

      <title>The impact of internal variability on benchmarking deep learning climate emulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full-complexity Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally very expensive, limiting their use in exploring the climate outcomes of multiple emission pathways. More efficient emulators that approximate ESMs can directly map emissions onto climate outcomes, and benchmarks are being used to evaluate their accuracy on standardized tasks and datasets. We investigate a popular benchmark in data-driven climate emulation, ClimateBench, on which deep learning-based emulators are currently achieving the best performance. We compare these deep learning emulators with a linear regression-based emulator, akin to pattern scaling, and show that it outperforms the incumbent 100M-parameter deep learning foundation model, ClimaX, on 3 out of 4 regionally-resolved climate variables, notably surface temperature and precipitation. While emulating surface temperature is expected to be predominantly linear, this result is surprising for emulating precipitation. Precipitation is a much more noisy variable, and we show that deep learning emulators can overfit to internal variability noise at low frequencies, degrading their performance in comparison to a linear emulator. We address the issue of overfitting by increasing the number of climate simulations per emission pathway (from 3 to 50) and updating the benchmark targets with the respective ensemble averages from the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model. Using the new targets, we show that linear pattern scaling continues to be more accurate on temperature, but can be outperformed by a deep learning-based technique for emulating precipitation. We publish our code and data at github.com/blutjens/climate-emulator.</description>

      <title>Monge-Kantorovich Fitting With Sobolev Budgets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $m &lt; n$, we consider the problem of ``best'' approximating an $n\text{-d}$ probability measure $\rho$ via an $m\text{-d}$ measure $\nu$ such that $\mathrm{supp}\ \nu$ has bounded total ``complexity.'' When $\rho$ is concentrated near an $m\text{-d}$ set we may interpret this as a manifold learning problem with noisy data. However, we do not restrict our analysis to this case, as the more general formulation has broader applications.
  We quantify $\nu$'s performance in approximating $\rho$ via the Monge-Kantorovich (also called Wasserstein) $p$-cost $\mathbb{W}_p^p(\rho, \nu)$, and constrain the complexity by requiring $\mathrm{supp}\ \nu$ to be coverable by an $f : \mathbb{R}^{m} \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$ whose $W^{k,q}$ Sobolev norm is bounded by $\ell \geq 0$. This allows us to reformulate the problem as minimizing a functional $\mathscr J_p(f)$ under the Sobolev ``budget'' $\ell$. This problem is closely related to (but distinct from) principal curves with length constraints when $m=1, k = 1$ and an unsupervised analogue of smoothing splines when $k &gt; 1$. New challenges arise from the higher-order differentiability condition.
  We study the ``gradient'' of $\mathscr J_p$, which is given by a certain vector field that we call the barycenter field, and use it to prove a nontrivial (almost) strict monotonicity result. We also provide a natural discretization scheme and establish its consistency. We use this scheme as a toy model for a generative learning task, and by analogy, propose novel interpretations for the role regularization plays in improving training.</description>

      <title>On the Implicit Relation Between Low-Rank Adaptation and Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17538v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant approach in natural language processing involves large-scale pre-training of models on general domain data followed by their adaptation to specific tasks or domains. As models grow in size, full fine-tuning all of their parameters becomes increasingly impractical. To address this, some methods for low-rank task adaptation of language models have been proposed, e.g., LoRA and FLoRA. These methods keep the pre-trained model weights fixed and incorporate trainable low-rank decomposition matrices into some layers of the transformer architecture, called adapters. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for downstream tasks compared to full fine-tuning all parameters. In this work, we look at low-rank adaptation from the lens of data privacy. We show theoretically that the low-rank adaptation used in LoRA and FLoRA leads to the injection of some random noise into the batch gradients w.r.t the adapter parameters. We quantify the variance of the injected noise and show that the smaller the adaptation rank, the larger the noise variance. By establishing a Berry-Esseen type bound on the total variation distance between distribution of the injected noise and a Gaussian distribution with the same variance, we show that the dynamics of low-rank adaptation is close to that of differentially private fine-tuning of the adapters. Finally, using Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, we show that when augmented with gradient scaling, low-rank adaptation is very close to performing DPSGD algorithm with a fixed noise scale to fine-tune the adapters. Suggested by our theoretical findings and approved by our experimental results, we show that low-rank adaptation, besides mitigating the space and computational complexities, implicitly provides a privacy protection w.r.t the fine-tuning data, without inducing the high space complexity of DPSGD.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Insights into Fine-Tuning Attention Mechanism: Generalization and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), built on Transformer architectures, exhibit remarkable generalization across a wide range of tasks. However, fine-tuning these models for specific tasks remains resource-intensive due to their extensive parameterization. In this paper, we investigate two remarkable phenomena related to the attention mechanism during the fine-tuning of LLMs. The first phenomenon, termed "Unequal Importance of Attention Matrices," highlights the impact of fine-tuning different weight matrices. It shows that optimizing the $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrix yields significantly better performance than optimizing the $\mathbf{W}_k$ matrix. Fine-tuning only the $\mathbf{W}_q$ and $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrices is computationally efficient while delivering results comparable to, or even better than fine-tuning all three matrices ($\mathbf{W}_q$, $\mathbf{W}_k$, and $\mathbf{W}_v$). The second phenomenon, "Attention Matrices with Customized Learning Rate Leads to Better Convergence," emphasizes the importance of assigning distinct learning rates to these matrices. Specifically, a higher learning rate for the $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrix compared to $\mathbf{W}_q$ and $\mathbf{W}_k$ accelerates convergence and improves performance. Building on these insights, we propose a new strategy that improves fine-tuning efficiency in terms of both storage and time. Experimental results on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of this approach, supporting our theoretical findings. Our analysis lays the theoretical groundwork for configuring and improving lightweight algorithms in LLMs fine-tuning.</description>

Abstract: There is an ongoing effort to develop feature selection algorithms to improve interpretability, reduce computational resources, and minimize overfitting in predictive models. Neural networks stand out as architectures on which to build feature selection methods, and recently, neuron pruning and regrowth have emerged from the sparse neural network literature as promising new tools. We introduce RelChaNet, a novel and lightweight supervised feature selection algorithm that uses neuron pruning and regrowth in the input layer of a dense neural network. For neuron pruning, a gradient sum metric measures the relative change induced in a network after a feature enters, while neurons are randomly regrown. We also propose an extension that adapts the size of the input layer at runtime. Extensive experiments on 13 different datasets show that our approach generally outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and in particular improves the average accuracy by 2% on the MNIST dataset.

      <title>Improving Neural Optimal Transport via Displacement Interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) theory investigates the cost-minimizing transport map that moves a source distribution to a target distribution. Recently, several approaches have emerged for learning the optimal transport map for a given cost function using neural networks. We refer to these approaches as the OT Map. OT Map provides a powerful tool for diverse machine learning tasks, such as generative modeling and unpaired image-to-image translation. However, existing methods that utilize max-min optimization often experience training instability and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve stability and achieve a better approximation of the OT Map by exploiting displacement interpolation, dubbed Displacement Interpolation Optimal Transport Model (DIOTM). We derive the dual formulation of displacement interpolation at specific time $t$ and prove how these dual problems are related across time. This result allows us to utilize the entire trajectory of displacement interpolation in learning the OT Map. Our method improves the training stability and achieves superior results in estimating optimal transport maps. We demonstrate that DIOTM outperforms existing OT-based models on image-to-image translation tasks.</description>

      <title>DDIL: Diversity Enhancing Diffusion Distillation With Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generative modeling (e.g., text-to-image) but sampling requires multiple denoising network passes, limiting practicality. Efforts such as progressive distillation or consistency distillation have shown promise by reducing the number of passes at the expense of quality of the generated samples. In this work we identify co-variate shift as one of reason for poor performance of multi-step distilled models from compounding error at inference time. To address co-variate shift, we formulate diffusion distillation within imitation learning (DDIL) framework and enhance training distribution for distilling diffusion models on both data distribution (forward diffusion) and student induced distributions (backward diffusion). Training on data distribution helps to diversify the generations by preserving marginal data distribution and training on student distribution addresses compounding error by correcting covariate shift. In addition, we adopt reflected diffusion formulation for distillation and demonstrate improved performance, stable training across different distillation methods. We show that DDIL consistency improves on baseline algorithms of progressive distillation (PD), Latent consistency models (LCM) and Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD2).</description>

      <title>MazeNet: An Accurate, Fast, and Scalable Deep Learning Solution for Steiner Minimum Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Obstacle Avoiding Rectilinear Steiner Minimum Tree (OARSMT) problem, which seeks the shortest interconnection of a given number of terminals in a rectilinear plane while avoiding obstacles, is a critical task in integrated circuit design, network optimization, and robot path planning. Since OARSMT is NP-hard, exact algorithms scale poorly with the number of terminals, leading practical solvers to sacrifice accuracy for large problems. We propose MazeNet, a deep learning-based method that learns to solve the OARSMT from data. MazeNet reframes OARSMT as a maze-solving task that can be addressed with a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN). A key hallmark of MazeNet is its scalability: we only need to train the RCNN blocks on mazes with a small number of terminals; larger mazes can be solved by replicating the same pre-trained blocks to create a larger network. Across a wide range of experiments, MazeNet achieves perfect OARSMT-solving accuracy, significantly reduces runtime compared to classical exact algorithms, and can handle more terminals than state-of-the-art approximate algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision. However, their performance in multivariate long-term forecasting often falls short compared to simpler linear baselines. Previous research has identified the traditional attention mechanism as a key factor limiting their effectiveness in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce LATST, a novel approach designed to mitigate entropy collapse and training instability common challenges in Transformer-based time series forecasting. We rigorously evaluate LATST across multiple real-world multivariate time series datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform existing state-of-the-art Transformer models. Notably, LATST manages to achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters than some linear models on certain datasets, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, I introduce the retrieval problem, a simple yet common reasoning task that can be solved only by transformers with a minimum number of layers, which grows logarithmically with the input size. I empirically show that large language models can solve the task under different prompting formulations without any fine-tuning. To understand how transformers solve the retrieval problem, I train several transformers on a minimal formulation. Successful learning occurs only under the presence of an implicit curriculum. I uncover the learned mechanisms by studying the attention maps in the trained transformers. I also study the training process, uncovering that attention heads always emerge in a specific sequence guided by the implicit curriculum.</description>

      <title>Trojan Cleansing with Neural Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trojan attacks are sophisticated training-time attacks on neural networks that embed backdoor triggers which force the network to produce a specific output on any input which includes the trigger. With the increasing relevance of deep networks which are too large to train with personal resources and which are trained on data too large to thoroughly audit, these training-time attacks pose a significant risk. In this work, we connect trojan attacks to Neural Collapse, a phenomenon wherein the final feature representations of over-parameterized neural networks converge to a simple geometric structure. We provide experimental evidence that trojan attacks disrupt this convergence for a variety of datasets and architectures. We then use this disruption to design a lightweight, broadly generalizable mechanism for cleansing trojan attacks from a wide variety of different network architectures and experimentally demonstrate its efficacy.</description>

Abstract: Personalized Federal learning(PFL) allows clients to cooperatively train a personalized model without disclosing their private dataset. However, PFL suffers from Non-IID, heterogeneous devices, lack of fairness, and unclear contribution which urgently need the interpretability of deep learning model to overcome these challenges. These challenges proposed new demands for interpretability. Low cost, privacy, and detailed information. There is no current interpretability method satisfying them. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability method \emph{FreqX} by introducing Signal Processing and Information Theory. Our experiments show that the explanation results of FreqX contain both attribution information and concept information. FreqX runs at least 10 times faster than the baselines which contain concept information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in machine learning have made its application to anomalous diffusion analysis both essential and inevitable. This review systematically introduces the integration of machine learning techniques for enhanced analysis of anomalous diffusion, focusing on two pivotal aspects: single trajectory characterization via machine learning and representation learning of anomalous diffusion. We extensively compare various machine learning methods, including both classical machine learning and deep learning, used for the inference of diffusion parameters and trajectory segmentation. Additionally, platforms such as the Anomalous Diffusion Challenge that serve as benchmarks for evaluating these methods are highlighted. On the other hand, we outline three primary strategies for representing anomalous diffusion: the combination of predefined features, the feature vector from the penultimate layer of neural network, and the latent representation from the autoencoder, analyzing their applicability across various scenarios. This investigation paves the way for future research, offering valuable perspectives that can further enrich the study of anomalous diffusion and advance the application of artificial intelligence in statistical physics and biophysics.</description>

      <title>COBRA: COmBinatorial Retrieval Augmentation for Few-Shot Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval augmentation, the practice of retrieving additional data from large auxiliary pools, has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing model performance in the low-data regime. Prior approaches have employed only nearest-neighbor based strategies for data selection, which retrieve auxiliary samples with high similarity to instances in the target task. However, these approaches are prone to selecting highly redundant samples, since they fail to incorporate any notion of diversity. In our work, we first demonstrate that data selection strategies used in prior retrieval-augmented few-shot adaptation settings can be generalized using a class of functions known as Combinatorial Mutual Information (CMI) measures. We then propose COBRA (COmBinatorial Retrieval Augmentation), which employs an alternative CMI measure that considers both diversity and similarity to a target dataset. COBRA consistently outperforms previous retrieval approaches across image classification tasks and few-shot learning techniques when used to retrieve samples from LAION-2B. COBRA introduces negligible computational overhead to the cost of retrieval while providing significant gains in downstream model performance.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Metropolis-Hastings Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach for integrating score-based models with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. While traditional score-based diffusion models excel in accurately learning the score function from data points, they lack an energy function, making the Metropolis-Hastings adjustment step inaccessible. Consequently, the unadjusted Langevin algorithm is often used for sampling using estimated score functions. The lack of an energy function then prevents the application of the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and other Metropolis-Hastings methods, limiting the wealth of other algorithms developed that use acceptance functions. We address this limitation by introducing a new loss function based on the \emph{detailed balance condition}, allowing the estimation of the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities given a learned score function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for various scenarios, including sampling from heavy-tail distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how random feature maps can be used to forecast dynamical systems with excellent forecasting skill. We consider the tanh activation function and judiciously choose the internal weights in a data-driven manner such that the resulting features explore the nonlinear, non-saturated regions of the activation function. We introduce skip connections and construct a deep variant of random feature maps by combining several units. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, we introduce localization where we learn local maps, employing conditional independence. Our modified random feature maps provide excellent forecasting skill for both single trajectory forecasts as well as long-time estimates of statistical properties, for a range of chaotic dynamical systems with dimensions up to 512. In contrast to other methods such as reservoir computers which require extensive hyperparameter tuning, we effectively need to tune only a single hyperparameter, and are able to achieve state-of-the-art forecast skill with much smaller networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has been integrated into nearly every aspect of daily life, powering applications from object detection with computer vision to large language models for writing emails and compact models for use in smart homes. These machine learning models at times cater to the needs of individual users but are often detached from them, as they are typically stored and processed in centralized data centers. This centralized approach raises privacy concerns, incurs high infrastructure costs, and struggles to provide real time, personalized experiences. Federated and fully decentralized learning methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they still depend on centralized servers or face slow convergence due to communication constraints. We propose ML Mule, an approach that utilizes individual mobile devices as 'mules' to train and transport model snapshots as the mules move through physical spaces, sharing these models with the physical 'spaces' the mules inhabit. This method implicitly forms affinity groups among devices associated with users who share particular spaces, enabling collaborative model evolution and protecting users' privacy. Our approach addresses several major shortcomings of traditional, federated, and fully decentralized learning systems. ML Mule represents a new class of machine learning methods that are more robust, distributed, and personalized, bringing the field closer to realizing the original vision of intelligent, adaptive, and genuinely context-aware smart environments. Our results show that ML Mule converges faster and achieves higher model accuracy compared to other existing methods.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Training through Iterative Gradient Propagation Along the Residual Path</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite being the cornerstone of deep learning, backpropagation is criticized for its inherent sequentiality, which can limit the scalability of very deep models. Such models faced convergence issues due to vanishing gradient, later resolved using residual connections. Variants of these are now widely used in modern architecture. However, the computational cost of backpropagation remains a major burden, accounting for most of the training time. Taking advantage of residual-like architectural designs, we introduce Highway backpropagation, a parallelizable iterative algorithm that approximates backpropagation, by alternatively i) accumulating the gradient estimates along the residual path, and ii) backpropagating them through every layer in parallel. This algorithm is naturally derived from a decomposition of the gradient as the sum of gradients flowing through all paths and is adaptable to a diverse set of common architectures, ranging from ResNets and Transformers to recurrent neural networks. Through an extensive empirical study on a large selection of tasks and models, we evaluate Highway-BP and show that major speedups can be achieved with minimal performance degradation.</description>

Abstract: Traditional methods for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on implicit principles, limiting interpretability. Constitutional AI (CAI) offers an explicit, rule-based framework for guiding LLM alignment. Building on this, we refine the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) algorithm, which extracts constitutions from preference datasets. By improving principle generation, clustering, and embedding processes, our approach enhances the accuracy and generalizability of extracted principles across synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results highlight the potential of these principles to foster more transparent and adaptable alignment methods, offering a promising direction for future advancements beyond traditional fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>CAMP in the Odyssey: Provably Robust Reinforcement Learning with Certified Radius Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained widespread adoption in control and decision-making tasks due to its strong performance in dynamic environments. However, DRL agents are vulnerable to noisy observations and adversarial attacks, and concerns about the adversarial robustness of DRL systems have emerged. Recent efforts have focused on addressing these robustness issues by establishing rigorous theoretical guarantees for the returns achieved by DRL agents in adversarial settings. Among these approaches, policy smoothing has proven to be an effective and scalable method for certifying the robustness of DRL agents. Nevertheless, existing certifiably robust DRL relies on policies trained with simple Gaussian augmentations, resulting in a suboptimal trade-off between certified robustness and certified return. To address this issue, we introduce a novel paradigm dubbed \texttt{C}ertified-r\texttt{A}dius-\texttt{M}aximizing \texttt{P}olicy (\texttt{CAMP}) training. \texttt{CAMP} is designed to enhance DRL policies, achieving better utility without compromising provable robustness. By leveraging the insight that the global certified radius can be derived from local certified radii based on training-time statistics, \texttt{CAMP} formulates a surrogate loss related to the local certified radius and optimizes the policy guided by this surrogate loss. We also introduce \textit{policy imitation} as a novel technique to stabilize \texttt{CAMP} training. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{CAMP} significantly improves the robustness-return trade-off across various tasks. Based on the results, \texttt{CAMP} can achieve up to twice the certified expected return compared to that of baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/NeuralSec/camp-robust-rl.</description>

      <title>Fast Direct: Query-Efficient Online Black-box Guidance for Diffusion-model Target Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01692v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion model to address specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/kimyong95/guide-stable-diffusion/tree/fast-direct</description>

      <title>The AI off-switch problem as a signalling game: bounded rationality and incomparability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The off-switch problem is a critical challenge in AI control: if an AI system resists being switched off, it poses a significant risk. In this paper, we model the off-switch problem as a signalling game, where a human decision-maker communicates its preferences about some underlying decision problem to an AI agent, which then selects actions to maximise the human's utility. We assume that the human is a bounded rational agent and explore various bounded rationality mechanisms. Using real machine learning models, we reprove prior results and demonstrate that a necessary condition for an AI system to refrain from disabling its off-switch is its uncertainty about the human's utility. We also analyse how message costs influence optimal strategies and extend the analysis to scenarios involving incomparability.</description>

      <title>XAMBA: Enabling Efficient State Space Models on Resource-Constrained Neural Processing Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to transformers for sequential data tasks, offering linear or near-linear scalability with sequence length, making them ideal for long-sequence applications in NLP, vision, and edge AI, including real-time transcription, translation, and contextual search. These applications require lightweight, high-performance models for deployment on resource-constrained devices like laptops and PCs. Designing specialized accelerators for every emerging neural network is costly and impractical; instead, optimizing models for existing NPUs in AI PCs provides a scalable solution. To this end, we propose XAMBA, the first framework to enable and optimize SSMs on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) state-of-the-art (SOTA) NPUs. XAMBA follows a three-step methodology: (1) enabling SSMs on NPUs, (2) optimizing performance to meet KPI requirements, and (3) trading accuracy for additional performance gains. After enabling SSMs on NPUs, XAMBA mitigates key bottlenecks using CumBA and ReduBA, replacing sequential CumSum and ReduceSum operations with matrix-based computations, significantly improving execution speed and memory efficiency. Additionally, ActiBA enhances performance by approximating expensive activation functions (e.g., Swish, Softplus) using piecewise linear mappings, reducing latency with minimal accuracy loss. Evaluations on an Intel Core Ultra Series 2 AI PC show that XAMBA achieves up to 4.8X speed-up over the baseline. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arghadippurdue/XAMBA.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Post-Training Quantization in LLMs: Comprehensive Taxonomy, Unified Evaluation, and Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-training Quantization (PTQ) technique has been extensively adopted for large language models (LLMs) compression owing to its efficiency and low resource requirement. However, current research lacks a in-depth analysis of the superior and applicable scenarios of each PTQ strategy. In addition, existing algorithms focus primarily on performance, overlooking the trade-off among model size, performance, and quantization bitwidth. To mitigate these confusions, we provide a novel benchmark for LLMs PTQ in this paper. Firstly, in order to support our benchmark, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy for existing mainstream methods by scrutinizing their computational strategies (e.g., optimization-based, compensation-based, etc.). Then, we conduct extensive experiments with the baseline within each class, covering models with various sizes (7B-70B), bitwidths, training levels (LLaMA1/2/3/3.1), architectures (Mixtral, DeepSeekMoE and Mamba) and modality (LLaVA1.5 and VILA1.5) on a wide range of evaluation metrics.Through comparative analysis on the results, we summarize the superior of each PTQ strategy and modelsize-bitwidth trade-off considering the performance. For example, our benchmark reveals that compensation-based technique demonstrates outstanding cross-architecture robustness and extremely low-bit PTQ for ultra large models should be reexamined. Finally, we further accordingly claim that a practical combination of compensation and other PTQ strategy can achieve SOTA various robustness. We believe that our benchmark will provide valuable recommendations for the deployment of LLMs and future research on PTQ approaches.We conduct an repository for our benchmark at https://github.com/zjq0455/PTQ_Benchmark.</description>

      <title>ReQFlow: Rectified Quaternion Flow for Efficient and High-Quality Protein Backbone Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein backbone generation plays a central role in de novo protein design and is significant for many biological and medical applications. Although diffusion and flow-based generative models provide potential solutions to this challenging task, they often generate proteins with undesired designability and suffer computational inefficiency. In this study, we propose a novel rectified quaternion flow (ReQFlow) matching method for fast and high-quality protein backbone generation. In particular, our method generates a local translation and a 3D rotation from random noise for each residue in a protein chain, which represents each 3D rotation as a unit quaternion and constructs its flow by spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) in an exponential format. We train the model by quaternion flow (QFlow) matching with guaranteed numerical stability and rectify the QFlow model to accelerate its inference and improve the designability of generated protein backbones, leading to the proposed ReQFlow model. Experiments show that ReQFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in protein backbone generation while requiring much fewer sampling steps and significantly less inference time (e.g., being 37x faster than RFDiffusion and 62x faster than Genie2 when generating a backbone of length 300), demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/AngxiaoYue/ReQFlow.</description>

      <title>CryptoPulse: Short-Term Cryptocurrency Forecasting with Dual-Prediction and Cross-Correlated Market Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryptocurrencies fluctuate in markets with high price volatility, posing significant challenges for investors. To aid in informed decision-making, systems predicting cryptocurrency market movements have been developed, typically focusing on historical patterns. However, these methods often overlook three critical factors influencing market dynamics: 1) the macro investing environment, reflected in major cryptocurrency fluctuations affecting collaborative investor behaviors; 2) overall market sentiment, heavily influenced by news impacting investor strategies; and 3) technical indicators, offering insights into overbought or oversold conditions, momentum, and market trends, which are crucial for short-term price movements. This paper proposes a dual prediction mechanism that forecasts the next day's closing price by incorporating macroeconomic fluctuations, technical indicators, and individual cryptocurrency price changes. Additionally, a novel refinement mechanism enhances predictions through market sentiment-based rescaling and fusion. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming ten comparison methods.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical graph sampling based minibatch learning with chain preservation and variance reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00860v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph sampling based Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) decouple the sampling from the forward and backward propagation during minibatch training, which exhibit good scalability in terms of layer depth and graph size. We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.

      <title>Building Machine Learning Challenges for Anomaly Detection in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific discoveries are often made by finding a pattern or object that was not predicted by the known rules of science. Oftentimes, these anomalous events or objects that do not conform to the norms are an indication that the rules of science governing the data are incomplete, and something new needs to be present to explain these unexpected outliers. The challenge of finding anomalies can be confounding since it requires codifying a complete knowledge of the known scientific behaviors and then projecting these known behaviors on the data to look for deviations. When utilizing machine learning, this presents a particular challenge since we require that the model not only understands scientific data perfectly but also recognizes when the data is inconsistent and out of the scope of its trained behavior. In this paper, we present three datasets aimed at developing machine learning-based anomaly detection for disparate scientific domains covering astrophysics, genomics, and polar science. We present the different datasets along with a scheme to make machine learning challenges around the three datasets findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, we present an approach that generalizes to future machine learning challenges, enabling the possibility of large, more compute-intensive challenges that can ultimately lead to scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Make Haste Slowly: A Theory of Emergent Structured Mixed Selectivity in Feature Learning ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spite of finite dimension ReLU neural networks being a consistent factor behind recent deep learning successes, a theory of feature learning in these models remains elusive. Currently, insightful theories still rely on assumptions including the linearity of the network computations, unstructured input data and architectural constraints such as infinite width or a single hidden layer. To begin to address this gap we establish an equivalence between ReLU networks and Gated Deep Linear Networks, and use their greater tractability to derive dynamics of learning. We then consider multiple variants of a core task reminiscent of multi-task learning or contextual control which requires both feature learning and nonlinearity. We make explicit that, for these tasks, the ReLU networks possess an inductive bias towards latent representations which are not strictly modular or disentangled but are still highly structured and reusable between contexts. This effect is amplified with the addition of more contexts and hidden layers. Thus, we take a step towards a theory of feature learning in finite ReLU networks and shed light on how structured mixed-selective latent representations can emerge due to a bias for node-reuse and learning speed.</description>

      <title>Studying the Interplay Between the Actor and Critic Representations in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting relevant information from a stream of high-dimensional observations is a central challenge for deep reinforcement learning agents. Actor-critic algorithms add further complexity to this challenge, as it is often unclear whether the same information will be relevant to both the actor and the critic. To this end, we here explore the principles that underlie effective representations for the actor and for the critic in on-policy algorithms. We focus our study on understanding whether the actor and critic will benefit from separate, rather than shared, representations. Our primary finding is that when separated, the representations for the actor and critic systematically specialise in extracting different types of information from the environment -- the actor's representation tends to focus on action-relevant information, while the critic's representation specialises in encoding value and dynamics information. We conduct a rigourous empirical study to understand how different representation learning approaches affect the actor and critic's specialisations and their downstream performance, in terms of sample efficiency and generation capabilities. Finally, we discover that a separated critic plays an important role in exploration and data collection during training. Our code, trained models and data are accessible at https://github.com/francelico/deac-rep.</description>

      <title>DP-GPL: Differentially Private Graph Prompt Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various applications. Recently, graph prompt learning has emerged as a powerful GNN training paradigm, inspired by advances in language and vision foundation models. Here, a GNN is pre-trained on public data and then adapted to sensitive tasks using lightweight graph prompts. However, using prompts from sensitive data poses privacy risks. In this work, we are the first to investigate these practical risks in graph prompts by instantiating a membership inference attack that reveals significant privacy leakage. We also find that the standard privacy method, DP-SGD, fails to provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning, likely due to the small number of sensitive data points used to learn the prompts. As a solution, we propose DP-GPL for differentially private graph prompt learning based on the PATE framework, that generates a graph prompt with differential privacy guarantees. Our evaluation across various graph prompt learning methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies demonstrates that our algorithm achieves high utility at strong privacy, effectively mitigating privacy concerns while preserving the powerful capabilities of prompted GNNs as powerful foundation models in the graph domain.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Diffusion Generative Models via Rich Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Rich Preference Optimization (RPO), a novel pipeline that leverages rich feedback signals to improve the curation of preference pairs for fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models. Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images to extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Weighted Graph Structure Learning with Attention Denoising for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Node classification in graphs aims to predict the categories of unlabeled nodes by utilizing a small set of labeled nodes. However, weighted graphs often contain noisy edges and anomalous edge weights, which can distort fine-grained relationships between nodes and hinder accurate classification. We propose the Edge Weight-aware Graph Structure Learning (EWGSL) method, which combines weight learning and graph structure learning to address these issues. EWGSL improves node classification by redefining attention coefficients in graph attention networks to incorporate node features and edge weights. It also applies graph structure learning to sparsify attention coefficients and uses a modified InfoNCE loss function to enhance performance by adapting to denoised graph weights. Extensive experimental results show that EWGSL has an average Micro-F1 improvement of 17.8% compared with the best baseline.</description>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used for interpreting language model activations. A key evaluation metric is the increase in cross-entropy loss between the original model logits and the reconstructed model logits when replacing model activations with SAE reconstructions. Typically, SAEs are trained solely on mean squared error (MSE) when reconstructing precomputed, shuffled activations. Recent work introduced training SAEs directly with a combination of KL divergence and MSE ("end-to-end" SAEs), significantly improving reconstruction accuracy at the cost of substantially increased computation, which has limited their widespread adoption. We propose a brief KL+MSE fine-tuning step applied only to the final 25M training tokens (just a few percent of typical training budgets) that achieves comparable improvements, reducing the cross-entropy loss gap by 20-50%, while incurring minimal additional computational cost. We further find that multiple fine-tuning methods (KL fine-tuning, LoRA adapters, linear adapters) yield similar, non-additive cross-entropy improvements, suggesting a common, easily correctable error source in MSE-trained SAEs. We demonstrate a straightforward method for effectively transferring hyperparameters and sparsity penalties between training phases despite scale differences between KL and MSE losses. While both ReLU and TopK SAEs see significant cross-entropy loss improvements, evaluations on supervised SAEBench metrics yield mixed results, with improvements on some metrics and decreases on others, depending on both the SAE architecture and downstream task. Nonetheless, our method may offer meaningful improvements in interpretability applications such as circuit analysis with minor additional cost.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Smart Contract Reputability Analysis using Multimodal Data Fusion on Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaluation of smart contract reputability is essential to foster trust in decentralized ecosystems. However, existing methods that rely solely on code analysis or transactional data, offer limited insight into evolving trustworthiness. We propose a multimodal data fusion framework that integrates code features with transactional data to enhance reputability prediction. Our framework initially focuses on AI-based code analysis, utilizing GAN-augmented opcode embeddings to address class imbalance, achieving 97.67% accuracy and a recall of 0.942 in detecting illicit contracts, surpassing traditional oversampling methods. This forms the crux of a reputability-centric fusion strategy, where combining code and transactional data improves recall by 7.25% over single-source models, demonstrating robust performance across validation sets. By providing a holistic view of smart contract behaviour, our approach enhances the model's ability to assess reputability, identify fraudulent activities, and predict anomalous patterns. These capabilities contribute to more accurate reputability assessments, proactive risk mitigation, and enhanced blockchain security.</description>

      <title>LoRA Subtraction for Drift-Resistant Space in Exemplar-Free Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continual learning (CL), catastrophic forgetting often arises due to feature drift. This challenge is particularly prominent in the exemplar-free continual learning (EFCL) setting, where samples from previous tasks cannot be retained, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. To address this issue, some EFCL methods aim to identify feature spaces that minimize the impact on previous tasks while accommodating new ones. However, they rely on static features or outdated statistics stored from old tasks, which prevents them from capturing the dynamic evolution of the feature space in CL, leading to performance degradation over time. In this paper, we introduce the Drift-Resistant Space (DRS), which effectively handles feature drifts without requiring explicit feature modeling or the storage of previous tasks. A novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach called Low-Rank Adaptation Subtraction (LoRA-) is proposed to develop the DRS. This method subtracts the LoRA weights of old tasks from the initial pre-trained weight before processing new task data to establish the DRS for model training. Therefore, LoRA- enhances stability, improves efficiency, and simplifies implementation. Furthermore, stabilizing feature drifts allows for better plasticity by learning with a triplet loss. Our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, especially for long task sequences, across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Graph neural networks extrapolate out-of-distribution for shortest paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs), despite their success and wide adoption, still struggle to extrapolate out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., to inputs that are not well-represented by their training dataset. Addressing the OOD generalization gap is crucial when models are deployed in environments significantly different from the training set, such as applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on small graphs to large, real-world graphs. One promising approach for achieving robust OOD generalization is the framework of neural algorithmic alignment, which incorporates ideas from classical algorithms by designing neural architectures that resemble specific algorithmic paradigms (e.g. dynamic programming). The hope is that trained models of this form would have superior OOD capabilities, in much the same way that classical algorithms work for all instances. We rigorously analyze the role of algorithmic alignment in achieving OOD generalization, focusing on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to the canonical shortest path problem. We prove that GNNs, trained to minimize a sparsity-regularized loss over a small set of shortest path instances, exactly implement the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm for shortest paths. In fact, if a GNN minimizes this loss within an error of $\epsilon$, it implements the BF algorithm with an error of $O(\epsilon)$. Consequently, despite limited training data, these GNNs are guaranteed to extrapolate to arbitrary shortest-path problems, including instances of any size. Our empirical results support our theory by showing that NNs trained by gradient descent are able to minimize this loss and extrapolate in practice.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm (AGRO, for Any-Generation Reward Optimization) for fine-tuning large-language models. AGRO leverages the concept of generation consistency, which states that the optimal policy satisfies the notion of consistency across any possible generation of the model. We derive algorithms that find optimal solutions via the sample-based policy gradient and provide theoretical guarantees on their convergence. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AGRO in both on-policy and off-policy settings, showing improved performance on the mathematical reasoning dataset over baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Innovative LSGTime Model for Crime Spatiotemporal Prediction Based on MindSpore Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, the spatiotemporal characteristics of criminal activities have become increasingly complex. Accurate prediction of crime distribution is crucial for optimizing the allocation of police resources and preventing crime. This paper proposes LGSTime, a crime spatiotemporal prediction model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the Multi-head Sparse Self-attention mechanism. LSTM and GRU capture long-term dependencies in crime time series, such as seasonality and periodicity, through their unique gating mechanisms. The Multi-head Sparse Self-attention mechanism, on the other hand, focuses on both temporal and spatial features of criminal events simultaneously through parallel processing and sparsification techniques, significantly improving computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. The integrated model leverages the strengths of each technique to better handle complex spatiotemporal data. Experimental findings demonstrate that the model attains optimal performance across four real - world crime datasets. In comparison to the CNN model, it exhibits performance enhancements of 2.8\%, 1.9\%, and 1.4\% in the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics respectively. These results offer a valuable reference for tackling the challenges in crime prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new uncertainty propagation methods for feed-forward neural network architectures with leaky ReLU activation functions subject to random perturbations in the input vectors. In particular, we derive analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of the neural network output and its statistical moments as a function of the input uncertainty and the parameters of the network, i.e., weights and biases. A key finding is that an appropriate linearization of the leaky ReLU activation function yields accurate statistical results even for large perturbations in the input vectors. This can be attributed to the way information propagates through the network. We also propose new analytically tractable Gaussian copula surrogate models to approximate the full joint PDF of the neural network output. To validate our theoretical results, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations and a thorough error analysis on a multi-layer neural network representing a nonlinear integro-differential operator between two polynomial function spaces. Our findings demonstrate excellent agreement between the theoretical predictions and Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning for Entropy-Regularized Markov Decision Processes via Multilevel Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing efficient learning algorithms with complexity guarantees for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with large or continuous state and action spaces remains a fundamental challenge. We address this challenge for entropy-regularized MDPs with Polish state and action spaces, assuming access to a generative model of the environment. We propose a novel family of multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) algorithms that integrate fixed-point iteration with MLMC techniques and a generic stochastic approximation of the Bellman operator. We quantify the precise impact of the chosen approximate Bellman operator on the accuracy of the resulting MLMC estimator. Leveraging this error analysis, we show that using a biased plain MC estimate for the Bellman operator results in quasi-polynomial sample complexity, whereas an unbiased randomized multilevel approximation of the Bellman operator achieves polynomial sample complexity in expectation. Notably, these complexity bounds are independent of the dimensions or cardinalities of the state and action spaces, distinguishing our approach from existing algorithms whose complexities scale with the sizes of these spaces. We validate these theoretical performance guarantees through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The Mathematical Relationship Between Layer Normalization and Dynamic Activation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent paper proposes Dynamic Tanh (DyT) as a drop-in replacement for layer normalization (LN). Although the method is empirically well-motivated and appealing from a practical point of view, it lacks a theoretical foundation. In this work, we shed light on the mathematical relationship between layer normalization and dynamic activation functions. In particular, we derive DyT from LN and show that a well-defined approximation is needed to do so. By dropping said approximation, an alternative activation function is obtained, which we call Dynamic Inverse Square Root Unit (DyISRU). DyISRU is the exact counterpart of layer normalization, and we demonstrate numerically that it indeed resembles LN more accurately than DyT does.</description>

Abstract: Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HRKGs) extend traditional KGs beyond binary relations, enabling the representation of contextual, provenance, and temporal information in domains, such as historical events, sensor data, video content, and narratives. HRKGs can be structured using several Metadata Representation Models (MRMs), including Reification (REF), Singleton Property (SGP), and RDF-star (RDR). However, the effects of different MRMs on KG Embedding (KGE) and Link Prediction (LP) models remain unclear. This study evaluates MRMs in the context of LP tasks, identifies the limitations of existing evaluation frameworks, and introduces a new task that ensures fair comparisons across MRMs. Furthermore, we propose a framework that effectively reflects the knowledge representations of the three MRMs in latent space. Experiments on two types of datasets reveal that REF performs well in simple HRKGs, whereas SGP is less effective. However, in complex HRKGs, the differences among MRMs in the LP tasks are minimal. Our findings contribute to an optimal knowledge representation strategy for HRKGs in LP tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning large language models with human preferences. While recent research has focused on algorithmic improvements, the importance of prompt-data construction has been overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven bottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and decreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to mitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method, Pre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness. Additionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in RLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model sizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that RTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth, and then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid capture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial improvements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance of careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome performance barriers in RLHF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Entropy-Guided Sequence Weighting (EGSW), a novel approach that enhances the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by dynamically assigning weights to generated outputs based on their advantage and entropy for Reinforcement Learning-based Large Language Model fine-tuning. EGSW integrates entropy regularization with advantage-based weighting to balance policy updates, enabling efficient exploration in high-dimensional state spaces. By employing temperature-scaled softmax weighting over sequences, EGSW prioritizing high-reward, high-uncertainty steps while maintaining training stability. Although originally developed to improve Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, EGSW is generalizable to other reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and can be implemented in both step-wise and trajectory-wise settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that EGSW enhances GRPO reasoning ability, yielding improvements in sample efficiency. Future work will explore the application of EGSW to advanced RL methodologies.</description>

Abstract: Uncovering unknown or missing links in social networks is a difficult task because of their sparsity and because links may represent different types of relationships, characterized by different structural patterns. In this paper, we define a simple yet efficient supervised learning-to-rank framework, called RankMerging, which aims at combining information provided by various unsupervised rankings. We illustrate our method on three different kinds of social networks and show that it substantially improves the performances of unsupervised metrics of ranking. We also compare it to other combination strategies based on standard methods. Finally, we explore various aspects of RankMerging, such as feature selection and parameter estimation and discuss its area of relevance: the prediction of an adjustable number of links on large networks.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the FSOCO dataset, a collaborative dataset for vision-based cone detection systems in Formula Student Driverless competitions. It contains human annotated ground truth labels for both bounding boxes and instance-wise segmentation masks. The data buy-in philosophy of FSOCO asks student teams to contribute to the database first before being granted access ensuring continuous growth. By providing clear labeling guidelines and tools for a sophisticated raw image selection, new annotations are guaranteed to meet the desired quality. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by comparing prediction results of a network trained on FSOCO and its unregulated predecessor.

Abstract: Adapting machine learning algorithms to better handle the presence of clusters or batch effects within training datasets is important across a wide variety of biological applications. This article considers the effect of ensembling Random Forest learners trained on clusters within a dataset with heterogeneity in the distribution of the features. We find that constructing ensembles of forests trained on clusters determined by algorithms such as k-means results in significant improvements in accuracy and generalizability over the traditional Random Forest algorithm. We begin with a theoretical exploration of the benefits of our novel approach, denoted as the Cross-Cluster Weighted Forest, and subsequently empirically examine its robustness to various data-generating scenarios and outcome models. Furthermore, we explore the influence of the data partitioning and ensemble weighting strategies on the benefits of our method over the existing paradigm. Finally, we apply our approach to cancer molecular profiling and gene expression datasets that are naturally divisible into clusters and illustrate that our approach outperforms classic Random Forest.</description>

The out-of-domain image evaluation shows the generalization capability of models, an essential aspect of real-world applications and an extensively studied topic of domain adaptation. These presented robustness and generalization evaluations are important when designing instance segmentation models for real-world applications and picking an off-the-shelf pretrained model to directly use for the task at hand. Specifically, this benchmark study includes state-of-the-art network architectures, network backbones, normalization layers, models trained starting from scratch versus pretrained networks, and the effect of multi-task training on robustness and generalization. Through this study, we gain several insights. For example, we find that group normalization enhances the robustness of networks across corruptions where the image contents stay the same but corruptions are added on top. On the other hand, batch normalization improves the generalization of the models across different datasets where statistics of image features change. We also find that single-stage detectors do not generalize well to larger image resolutions than their training size. On the other hand, multi-stage detectors can easily be used on images of different sizes. We hope that our comprehensive study will motivate the development of more robust and reliable instance segmentation models.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein multivariate auto-regressive models for modeling distributional time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05442v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the statistical analysis of data consisting of a collection of multiple series of probability measures that are indexed by distinct time instants and supported over a bounded interval of the real line. By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the existence, uniqueness and stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to two data sets, respectively made of observations from age distribution in different countries and those from the bike sharing network in Paris.</description>

Abstract: Ransomware attacks have caused billions of dollars in damages in recent years, and are expected to cause billions more in the future. Consequently, significant effort has been devoted to ransomware detection and mitigation. Behavioral-based ransomware detection approaches have garnered considerable attention recently. These behavioral detectors typically rely on process-based behavioral profiles to identify malicious behaviors. However, with an increasing body of literature highlighting the vulnerability of such approaches to evasion attacks, a comprehensive solution to the ransomware problem remains elusive. This paper presents Minerva, a novel, robust approach to ransomware detection. Minerva is engineered to be robust by design against evasion attacks, with architectural and feature selection choices informed by their resilience to adversarial manipulation. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of Minerva across a diverse spectrum of ransomware types, encompassing unseen ransomware as well as variants designed specifically to evade Minerva. Our evaluation showcases the ability of Minerva to accurately identify ransomware, generalize to unseen threats, and withstand evasion attacks. Furthermore, over 99% of detected ransomware are identified within 0.52sec of activity, enabling the adoption of data loss prevention techniques with near-zero overhead.</description>

      <title>Q-fid: Quantum Circuit Fidelity Improvement with LSTM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fidelity of quantum circuits (QC) is influenced by several factors, including hardware characteristics, calibration status, and the transpilation process, all of which impact their susceptibility to noise. However, existing methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q-fid is introduced, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q-fid provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity predictions under varying conditions. Q-fid achieves a high prediction accuracy with an average RMSE of 0.0515, up to 24.7x more accurate than the Qiskit transpile tool mapomatic. By offering a reliable method for fidelity prediction, Q-fid empowers developers to optimize transpilation strategies, leading to more efficient and noise-resilient quantum circuit implementations.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Play Text Games Well? Current State-of-the-Art and Open Questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have recently demonstrated their remarkable abilities of communicating with human users. In this technical report, we take an initiative to investigate their capacities of playing text games, in which a player has to understand the environment and respond to situations by having dialogues with the game world. Our experiments show that ChatGPT performs competitively compared to all the existing systems but still exhibits a low level of intelligence. Precisely, ChatGPT can not construct the world model by playing the game or even reading the game manual; it may fail to leverage the world knowledge that it already has; it cannot infer the goal of each step as the game progresses. Our results open up new research questions at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Emergent representations in networks trained with the Forward-Forward algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Backpropagation algorithm has often been criticised for its lack of biological realism. In an attempt to find a more biologically plausible alternative, the recently introduced Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the forward and backward passes of Backpropagation with two forward passes. In this work, we show that the internal representations obtained by the Forward-Forward algorithm can organise into category-specific ensembles exhibiting high sparsity -- composed of a low number of active units. This situation is reminiscent of what has been observed in cortical sensory areas, where neuronal ensembles are suggested to serve as the functional building blocks for perception and action. Interestingly, while this sparse pattern does not typically arise in models trained with standard Backpropagation, it can emerge in networks trained with Backpropagation on the same objective proposed for the Forward-Forward algorithm.</description>

      <title>Scaling Session-Based Transformer Recommendations using Optimized Negative Sampling and Loss Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces TRON, a scalable session-based Transformer Recommender using Optimized Negative-sampling. Motivated by the scalability and performance limitations of prevailing models such as SASRec and GRU4Rec+, TRON integrates top-k negative sampling and listwise loss functions to enhance its recommendation accuracy. Evaluations on relevant large-scale e-commerce datasets show that TRON improves upon the recommendation quality of current methods while maintaining training speeds similar to SASRec. A live A/B test yielded an 18.14% increase in click-through rate over SASRec, highlighting the potential of TRON in practical settings. For further research, we provide access to our source code at https://github.com/otto-de/TRON and an anonymized dataset at https://github.com/otto-de/recsys-dataset.</description>

      <title>Optimal vintage factor analysis with deflation varimax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vintage factor analysis is one important type of factor analysis that aims to first find a low-dimensional representation of the original data, and then to seek a rotation such that the rotated low-dimensional representation is scientifically meaningful. The most widely used vintage factor analysis is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by the varimax rotation. Despite its popularity, little theoretical guarantee can be provided to date mainly because varimax rotation requires to solve a non-convex optimization over the set of orthogonal matrices.
  In this paper, we propose a deflation varimax procedure that solves each row of an orthogonal matrix sequentially. In addition to its net computational gain and flexibility, we are able to fully establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed procedure in a broader context. Adopting this new deflation varimax as the second step after PCA, we further analyze this two step procedure under a general class of factor models. Our results show that it estimates the factor loading matrix in the minimax optimal rate when the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is moderate or large. In the low SNR regime, we offer possible improvement over using PCA and the deflation varimax when the additive noise under the factor model is structured. The modified procedure is shown to be minimax optimal in all SNR regimes. Our theory is valid for finite sample and allows the number of the latent factors to grow with the sample size as well as the ambient dimension to grow with, or even exceed, the sample size. Extensive simulation and real data analysis further corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Bayesian Inference from Privacy Protected Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many modern statistical analysis and machine learning applications require training models on sensitive user data. Under a formal definition of privacy protection, differentially private algorithms inject calibrated noise into the confidential data or during the data analysis process to produce privacy-protected datasets or queries. However, restricting access to only privatized data during statistical analysis makes it computationally challenging to make valid statistical inferences. In this work, we propose simulation-based inference methods from privacy-protected datasets. In addition to sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation, we adopt neural conditional density estimators as a flexible family of distributions to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters given the observed private query results. We illustrate our methods on discrete time-series data under an infectious disease model and with ordinary linear regression models. Illustrating the privacy-utility trade-off, our experiments and analysis demonstrate the necessity and feasibility of designing valid statistical inference procedures to correct for biases introduced by the privacy-protection mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Control Family of Dynamical Systems for Universal Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universal approximation property (UAP) holds a fundamental position in deep learning, as it provides a theoretical foundation for the expressive power of neural networks. It is widely recognized that a composition of linear and nonlinear functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, can approximate continuous functions on compact domains. In this paper, we extend this efficacy to a scenario containing dynamical systems with controls. We prove that the control family $\mathcal{F}_1$ containing all affine maps and the nonlinear ReLU map is sufficient for generating flow maps that can approximate orientation-preserving (OP) diffeomorphisms on any compact domain. Since $\mathcal{F}_1$ contains only one nonlinear function and the UAP does not hold if we remove the nonlinear function, we call $\mathcal{F}_1$ a minimal control family for the UAP. On this basis, several mild sufficient conditions, such as affine invariance, are established for the control family and discussed. Our results reveal an underlying connection between the approximation power of neural networks and control systems and could provide theoretical guidance for examining the approximation power of flow-based models.</description>

      <title>A deep implicit-explicit minimizing movement method for option pricing in jump-diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel deep learning approach for pricing European basket options written on assets that follow jump-diffusion dynamics. The option pricing problem is formulated as a partial integro-differential equation, which is approximated via a new implicit-explicit minimizing movement time-stepping approach, involving approximation by deep, residual-type Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for each time step. The integral operator is discretized via two different approaches: (a) a sparse-grid Gauss-Hermite approximation following localised coordinate axes arising from singular value decompositions, and (b) an ANN-based high-dimensional special-purpose quadrature rule. Crucially, the proposed ANN is constructed to ensure the appropriate asymptotic behavior of the solution for large values of the underlyings and also leads to consistent outputs with respect to a priori known qualitative properties of the solution. The performance and robustness with respect to the dimension of these methods are assessed in a series of numerical experiments involving the Merton jump-diffusion model, while a comparison with the deep Galerkin method and the deep BSDE solver with jumps further supports the merits of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01116v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical architecture designed for scalable real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) in complex, multi-modal traffic scenarios. This architecture comprises two key components: 1) RAID-Net, a novel attention-based Recurrent Neural Network that predicts relevant interactions along the MPC prediction horizon between the autonomous vehicle and the surrounding vehicles using Lagrangian duality, and 2) a reduced Stochastic MPC problem that eliminates irrelevant collision avoidance constraints, enhancing computational efficiency. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated traffic intersection with interactive surrounding vehicles, showcasing a 12x speed-up in solving the motion planning problem. A video demonstrating the proposed architecture in multiple complex traffic scenarios can be found here: https://youtu.be/-pRiOnPb9_c.

      <title>Rethinking Optimization and Architecture for Tiny Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power of large language models (LLMs) has been demonstrated through numerous data and computing resources. However, the application of language models on mobile devices is facing huge challenge on the computation and memory costs, that is, tiny language models with high performance are urgently required. Limited by the highly complex training process, there are many details for optimizing language models that are seldom studied carefully. In this study, based on a tiny language model with 1B parameters, we carefully design a series of empirical study to analyze the effect of each component. Three perspectives are mainly discussed, \ie, neural architecture, parameter initialization, and optimization strategy. Several design formulas are empirically proved especially effective for tiny language models, including tokenizer compression, architecture tweaking, parameter inheritance and multiple-round training. Then we train PanGu-$\pi$-1B Pro and PanGu-$\pi$-1.5B Pro on 1.6T multilingual corpora, following the established formulas. Experimental results demonstrate the improved optimization and architecture yield a notable average improvement of 8.87 on benchmark evaluation sets for PanGu-$\pi$-1B Pro. Besides, PanGu-$\pi$-1.5B Pro surpasses a range of SOTA models with larger model sizes, validating its superior performance.

      <title>Decentralized Bilevel Optimization: A Perspective from Transient Iteration Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic bilevel optimization (SBO) is becoming increasingly essential in machine learning due to its versatility in handling nested structures. To address large-scale SBO, decentralized approaches have emerged as effective paradigms in which nodes communicate with immediate neighbors without a central server, thereby improving communication efficiency and enhancing algorithmic robustness. However, most decentralized SBO algorithms focus solely on asymptotic convergence rates, overlooking transient iteration complexity-the number of iterations required before asymptotic rates dominate, which results in limited understanding of the influence of network topology, data heterogeneity, and the nested bilevel algorithmic structures. To address this issue, this paper introduces D-SOBA, a Decentralized Stochastic One-loop Bilevel Algorithm framework. D-SOBA comprises two variants: D-SOBA-SO, which incorporates second-order Hessian and Jacobian matrices, and D-SOBA-FO, which relies entirely on first-order gradients. We provide a comprehensive non-asymptotic convergence analysis and establish the transient iteration complexity of D-SOBA. This provides the first theoretical understanding of how network topology, data heterogeneity, and nested bilevel structures influence decentralized SBO. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and theoretical advantages of D-SOBA.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard modern machine-learning-based imaging methods have faced challenges in medical applications due to the high cost of dataset construction and, thereby, the limited labeled training data available. Additionally, upon deployment, these methods are usually used to process a large volume of data on a daily basis, imposing a high maintenance cost on medical facilities. In this paper, we introduce a new neural network architecture, termed LoGoNet, with a tailored self-supervised learning (SSL) method to mitigate such challenges. LoGoNet integrates a novel feature extractor within a U-shaped architecture, leveraging Large Kernel Attention (LKA) and a dual encoding strategy to capture both long-range and short-range feature dependencies adeptly. This is in contrast to existing methods that rely on increasing network capacity to enhance feature extraction. This combination of novel techniques in our model is especially beneficial in medical image segmentation, given the difficulty of learning intricate and often irregular body organ shapes, such as the spleen. Complementary, we propose a novel SSL method tailored for 3D images to compensate for the lack of large labeled datasets. The method combines masking and contrastive learning techniques within a multi-task learning framework and is compatible with both Vision Transformer (ViT) and CNN-based models. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods in numerous tasks across two standard datasets (i.e., BTCV and MSD). Benchmark comparisons with eight state-of-the-art models highlight LoGoNet's superior performance in both inference time and accuracy.</description>

      <title>MathWriting: A Dataset For Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions allows to transfer scientific notes into their digital form. It facilitates the sharing, searching, and preservation of scientific information. We introduce MathWriting, the largest online handwritten mathematical expression dataset to date. It consists of 230k human-written samples and an additional 400k synthetic ones}. This dataset can also be used in its rendered form for offline HME recognition. One MathWriting sample consists of a formula written on a touch screen and a corresponding LaTeX expression. We also provide a normalized version of LaTeX expression to simplify the recognition task and enhance the result quality. We provide baseline performance of standard models like OCR and CTC Transformer as well as Vision-Language Models like PaLI on the dataset. The dataset together with an example colab is accessible on Github.</description>

      <title>Distributed Fractional Bayesian Learning for Adaptive Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a distributed adaptive optimization problem, where all agents only have access to their local cost functions with a common unknown parameter, whereas they mean to collaboratively estimate the true parameter and find the optimal solution over a connected network. A general mathematical framework for such a problem has not been studied yet. We aim to provide valuable insights for addressing parameter uncertainty in distributed optimization problems and simultaneously find the optimal solution. Thus, we propose a novel Prediction while Optimization scheme, which utilizes distributed fractional Bayesian learning through weighted averaging on the log-beliefs to update the beliefs of unknown parameters, and distributed gradient descent for renewing the estimation of the optimal solution. Then under suitable assumptions, we prove that all agents' beliefs and decision variables converge almost surely to the true parameter and the optimal solution under the true parameter, respectively. We further establish a sublinear convergence rate for the belief sequence. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Modeling Caption Diversity in Contrastive Vision-Language Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are a thousand ways to caption an image. Contrastive Language Pretraining (CLIP) on the other hand, works by mapping an image and its caption to a single vector -- limiting how well CLIP-like models can represent the diverse ways to describe an image. In this work, we introduce Llip, Latent Language Image Pretraining, which models the diversity of captions that could match an image. Llip's vision encoder outputs a set of visual features that are mixed into a final representation by conditioning on information derived from the text. We show that Llip outperforms non-contextualized baselines like CLIP and SigLIP on a variety of tasks even with large-scale encoders. Llip improves zero-shot classification by an average of 2.9% zero-shot classification benchmarks with a ViT-G/14 encoder. Specifically, Llip attains a zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 83.5% on ImageNet outperforming a similarly sized CLIP by 1.4%. We also demonstrate improvement on zero-shot retrieval on MS-COCO by 6.0%. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the components introduced by the method and demonstrate that Llip leads to richer visual representations.</description>

      <title>Configurable Holography: Towards Display and Scene Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging learned holography approaches have enabled faster and high-quality hologram synthesis, setting a new milestone toward practical holographic displays. However, these learned models require training a dedicated model for each set of display-scene parameters. To address this shortcoming, our work introduces a highly configurable learned model structure, synthesizing 3D holograms interactively while supporting diverse display-scene parameters. Our family of models relying on this structure can be conditioned continuously for varying novel scene parameters, including input images, propagation distances, volume depths, peak brightnesses, and novel display parameters of pixel pitches and wavelengths. Uniquely, our findings unearth a correlation between depth estimation and hologram synthesis tasks in the learning domain, leading to a learned model that unlocks accurate 3D hologram generation from 2D images across varied display-scene parameters. We validate our models by synthesizing high-quality 3D holograms in simulations and also verify our findings with two different holographic display prototypes. Moreover, our family of models can synthesize holograms with a 2x speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art learned holography approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>A distance for mixed-variable and hierarchical domains with meta variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous datasets emerge in various machine learning and optimization applications that feature different input sources, types or formats. Most models or methods do not natively tackle heterogeneity. Hence, such datasets are often partitioned into smaller and simpler ones, which may limit the generalizability or performance, especially when data is limited. The first main contribution of this work is a modeling framework that generalizes hierarchical, tree-structured, variable-size or conditional search frameworks. The framework models mixed-variable and hierarchical domains in which variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical, with some identified as meta when they influence the structure of the problem. The second main contribution is a novel distance that compares any pair of mixed-variable points that do not share the same variables, allowing to use whole heterogeneous datasets that reside in mixed-variable and hierarchical domains with meta variables. The contributions are illustrated through regression and classification experiments using simple distance-based models applied to datasets of hyperparameters with corresponding performance scores.</description>

      <title>Lusifer: LLM-based User SImulated Feedback Environment for online Recommender systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13362v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) recommender systems often rely on static datasets that fail to capture the fluid, ever changing nature of user preferences in real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, generative AI techniques have emerged as powerful tools for creating synthetic data, including user profiles and behaviors. Recognizing this potential, we introduce Lusifer, an LLM-based simulation environment designed to generate dynamic, realistic user feedback for RL-based recommender training. In Lusifer, user profiles are incrementally updated at each interaction step, with Large Language Models (LLMs) providing transparent explanations of how and why preferences evolve. We focus on the MovieLens dataset, extracting only the last 40 interactions for each user, to emphasize recent behavior. By processing textual metadata (such as movie overviews and tags) Lusifer creates more context aware user states and simulates feedback on new items, including those with limited or no prior ratings. This approach reduces reliance on extensive historical data and facilitates cold start scenario handling and adaptation to out of distribution cases. Our experiments compare Lusifer with traditional collaborative filtering models, revealing that while Lusifer can be comparable in predictive accuracy, it excels at capturing dynamic user responses and yielding explainable results at every step. These qualities highlight its potential as a scalable, ethically sound alternative to live user experiments, supporting iterative and user-centric evaluations of RL-based recommender strategies. Looking ahead, we envision Lusifer serving as a foundational tool for exploring generative AI-driven user simulations, enabling more adaptive and personalized recommendation pipelines under real world constraints.</description>

      <title>Is Algorithmic Stability Testable? A Unified Framework under Computational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic stability is a central notion in learning theory that quantifies the sensitivity of an algorithm to small changes in the training data. If a learning algorithm satisfies certain stability properties, this leads to many important downstream implications, such as generalization, robustness, and reliable predictive inference. Verifying that stability holds for a particular algorithm is therefore an important and practical question. However, recent results establish that testing the stability of a black-box algorithm is impossible, given limited data from an unknown distribution, in settings where the data lies in an uncountably infinite space (such as real-valued data). In this work, we extend this question to examine a far broader range of settings, where the data may lie in any space -- for example, categorical data. We develop a unified framework for quantifying the hardness of testing algorithmic stability, which establishes that across all settings, if the available data is limited then exhaustive search is essentially the only universally valid mechanism for certifying algorithmic stability. Since in practice, any test of stability would naturally be subject to computational constraints, exhaustive search is impossible and so this implies fundamental limits on our ability to test the stability property for a black-box algorithm.</description>

      <title>Boost Your Human Image Generation Model via Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human image generation is a key focus in image synthesis due to its broad applications, but even slight inaccuracies in anatomy, pose, or details can compromise realism. To address these challenges, we explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which trains models to generate preferred (winning) images while diverging from non-preferred (losing) ones. However, conventional DPO methods use generated images as winning images, limiting realism. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced DPO approach that incorporates high-quality real images as winning images, encouraging outputs to resemble real images rather than generated ones. However, implementing this concept is not a trivial task. Therefore, our approach, HG-DPO (Human image Generation through DPO), employs a novel curriculum learning framework that gradually improves the output of the model toward greater realism, making training more feasible. Furthermore, HG-DPO effectively adapts to personalized text-to-image tasks, generating high-quality and identity-specific images, which highlights the practical value of our approach.</description>

      <title>LLMs Are Not Intelligent Thinkers: Introducing Mathematical Topic Tree Benchmark for Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in mathematical reasoning. However, despite these achievements, current evaluations are mostly limited to specific mathematical topics, and it remains unclear whether LLMs are genuinely engaging in reasoning. To address these gaps, we present the Mathematical Topics Tree (MaTT) benchmark, a challenging and structured benchmark that offers 1,958 questions across a wide array of mathematical subjects, each paired with a detailed hierarchical chain of topics. Upon assessing different LLMs using the MaTT benchmark, we find that the most advanced model, GPT-4, achieved a mere 54\% accuracy in a multiple-choice scenario. Interestingly, even when employing Chain-of-Thought prompting, we observe mostly no notable improvement. Moreover, LLMs accuracy dramatically reduced by up to 24.2 percentage point when the questions were presented without providing choices. Further detailed analysis of the LLMs' performance across a range of topics showed significant discrepancy even for closely related subtopics within the same general mathematical area. In an effort to pinpoint the reasons behind LLMs performances, we conducted a manual evaluation of the completeness and correctness of the explanations generated by GPT-4 when choices were available. Surprisingly, we find that in only 53.3\% of the instances where the model provided a correct answer, the accompanying explanations were deemed complete and accurate, i.e., the model engaged in genuine reasoning.</description>

      <title>VELOCITI: Benchmarking Video-Language Compositional Reasoning with Strict Entailment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental aspect of compositional reasoning in a video is associating people and their actions across time. Recent years have seen great progress in general-purpose vision or video models and a move towards long-video understanding. While exciting, we take a step back and ask: are current models good at compositional reasoning on short videos? To this end, we introduce VELOCITI, a benchmark to study Video-LLMs by disentangling and assessing the comprehension of agents, actions, and their associations across multiple events. We adopt the Video-Language Entailment setup and propose StrictVLE that requires correct classification (rather than ranking) of the positive and negative caption. We evaluate several models and observe that even the best, LLaVA-OneVision (44.5%) and Gemini-1.5-Pro (49.3%), are far from human accuracy at 93.0%. Results show that action understanding lags behind agents, and negative captions created using entities appearing in the video perform worse than those obtained from pure text manipulation. We also present challenges with ClassicVLE and multiple-choice (MC) evaluation, strengthening our preference for StrictVLE. Finally, we validate that our benchmark requires visual inputs of multiple frames making it ideal to study video-language compositional reasoning.</description>

      <title>Coupled Input-Output Dimension Reduction: Application to Goal-oriented Bayesian Experimental Design and Global Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method to jointly reduce the dimension of the input and output space of a function between high-dimensional spaces. Choosing a reduced input subspace influences which output subspace is relevant and vice versa. Conventional methods focus on reducing either the input or output space, even though both are often reduced simultaneously in practice. Our coupled approach naturally supports goal-oriented dimension reduction, where either an input or output quantity of interest is prescribed. We consider, in particular, goal-oriented sensor placement and goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, which can be viewed as dimension reduction where the most important output or, respectively, input components are chosen. Both applications present difficult combinatorial optimization problems with expensive objectives such as the expected information gain and Sobol' indices. By optimizing gradient-based bounds, we can determine the most informative sensors and most influential parameters as the largest diagonal entries of some diagnostic matrices, thus bypassing the combinatorial optimization and objective evaluation.</description>

      <title>Blind Baselines Beat Membership Inference Attacks for Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membership inference (MI) attacks try to determine if a data sample was used to train a machine learning model. For foundation models trained on unknown Web data, MI attacks are often used to detect copyrighted training materials, measure test set contamination, or audit machine unlearning. Unfortunately, we find that evaluations of MI attacks for foundation models are flawed, because they sample members and non-members from different distributions. For 8 published MI evaluation datasets, we show that blind attacks -- that distinguish the member and non-member distributions without looking at any trained model -- outperform state-of-the-art MI attacks. Existing evaluations thus tell us nothing about membership leakage of a foundation model's training data.</description>

      <title>Cascade Reward Sampling for Efficient Decoding-Time Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is essential for their applications. Recently, decoding-time alignment has emerged as an effective plug-and-play technique that avoids fine-tuning model parameters. This approach retains the general utility of pretrained LLMs but often suffers from significant inefficiencies during decoding, primarily due to wasted token generation and excessive reward evaluations. To address these challenges, we introduce Cascade Reward Sampling (CARDS) to resolve both efficiency bottlenecks in decoding-time alignment. Specifically, we develop a segment-level rejection sampling algorithm that minimizes redundant computations of both LLMs and reward models (RMs). Central to CARDS is an uncertainty-based segmentation mechanism, which ensures the accuracy of RMs evaluations on incomplete segments. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of reward scores on segments to elucidate the improved alignment performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CARDS significantly improves decoding efficiency, alignment quality, and general utility compared to existing decoding-time alignment methods, achieving approximately a 70% reduction in decoding time and over 90% win-ties in utility and safety benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.</description>

      <title>ShapG: new feature importance method based on the Shapley value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With wide application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), it has become particularly important to make decisions of AI systems explainable and transparent. In this paper, we proposed a new Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method called ShapG (Explanations based on Shapley value for Graphs) for measuring feature importance. ShapG is a model-agnostic global explanation method. At the first stage, it defines an undirected graph based on the dataset, where nodes represent features and edges are added based on calculation of correlation coefficients between features. At the second stage, it calculates an approximated Shapley value by sampling the data taking into account this graph structure. The sampling approach of ShapG allows to calculate the importance of features efficiently, i.e. to reduce computational complexity. Comparison of ShapG with other existing XAI methods shows that it provides more accurate explanations for two examined datasets. We also compared other XAI methods developed based on cooperative game theory with ShapG in running time, and the results show that ShapG exhibits obvious advantages in its running time, which further proves efficiency of ShapG. In addition, extensive experiments demonstrate a wide range of applicability of the ShapG method for explaining complex models. We find ShapG an important tool in improving explainability and transparency of AI systems and believe it can be widely used in various fields.</description>

      <title>What is Reproducibility in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), the reproducibility crisis underscores the urgent need for clear validation methodologies to maintain scientific integrity and encourage advancement. The crisis is compounded by the prevalent confusion over validation terminology. In response to this challenge, we introduce a framework that clarifies the roles and definitions of key validation efforts: repeatability, dependent and independent reproducibility, and direct and conceptual replicability. This structured framework aims to provide AI/ML researchers with the necessary clarity on these essential concepts, facilitating the appropriate design, conduct, and interpretation of validation studies. By articulating the nuances and specific roles of each type of validation study, we aim to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of research findings and support the community's efforts to address reproducibility challenges effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring pupil diameter is vital for gaining insights into physiological and psychological states - traditionally captured by expensive, specialized equipment like Tobii eye-trackers and Pupillabs glasses. This paper presents a novel application that enables pupil diameter estimation using standard webcams, making the process accessible in everyday environments without specialized equipment. Our app estimates pupil diameters from videos and offers detailed analysis, including class activation maps, graphs of predicted left and right pupil diameters, and eye aspect ratios during blinks. This tool expands the accessibility of pupil diameter measurement, particularly in everyday settings, benefiting fields like human behavior research and healthcare. Additionally, we present a new open source dataset for pupil diameter estimation using webcam images containing cropped eye images and corresponding pupil diameter measurements.</description>

      <title>PQCache: Product Quantization-based KVCache for Long Context LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to evolve, the context length in inference is steadily growing. Key-Value Cache (KVCache), the intermediate representations of tokens within LLM inference, has now become the primary memory bottleneck due to limited GPU memory. Current methods selectively determine suitable keys and values for self-attention computation in LLMs to address the issue. However, they either fall short in maintaining model quality or result in high serving latency. Drawing inspiration from advanced embedding retrieval techniques prevalent in the data management community, we consider the storage and retrieval of KVCache as a typical embedding retrieval problem. We propose PQCache, which employs Product Quantization (PQ) to manage KVCache, maintaining model quality while ensuring low serving latency. During the prefilling phase, we apply PQ to tokens' keys for each LLM layer and head. During the autoregressive decoding phase, we use PQ codes and centroids to approximately identify important preceding tokens, then fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation. Through meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any additional computation and communication overhead during both phases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQCache achieves both effectiveness and efficiency, with 4.60% score improvement over existing methods on InfiniteBench and low system latency in both prefilling and decoding.</description>

      <title>SoftCVI: Contrastive variational inference with self-generated soft labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating a distribution given access to its unnormalized density is pivotal in Bayesian inference, where the posterior is generally known only up to an unknown normalizing constant. Variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are the predominant tools for this task; however, both are often challenging to apply reliably, particularly when the posterior has complex geometry. Here, we introduce Soft Contrastive Variational Inference (SoftCVI), which allows a family of variational objectives to be derived through a contrastive estimation framework. The approach parameterizes a classifier in terms of a variational distribution, reframing the inference task as a contrastive estimation problem aiming to identify a single true posterior sample among a set of samples. Despite this framing, we do not require positive or negative samples, but rather learn by sampling the variational distribution and computing ground truth soft classification labels from the unnormalized posterior itself. The objectives have zero variance gradient when the variational approximation is exact, without the need for specialized gradient estimators. We empirically investigate the performance on a variety of Bayesian inference tasks, using both simple (e.g. normal) and expressive (normalizing flow) variational distributions. We find that SoftCVI can be used to form objectives which are stable to train and mass-covering, frequently outperforming inference with other variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Pareto Front Approximation for Multi-Objective Session-Based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces MultiTRON, an approach that adapts Pareto front approximation techniques to multi-objective session-based recommender systems using a transformer neural network. Our approach optimizes trade-offs between key metrics such as click-through and conversion rates by training on sampled preference vectors. A significant advantage is that after training, a single model can access the entire Pareto front, allowing it to be tailored to meet the specific requirements of different stakeholders by adjusting an additional input vector that weights the objectives. We validate the model's performance through extensive offline and online evaluation. For broader application and research, the source code is made available at https://github.com/otto-de/MultiTRON. The results confirm the model's ability to manage multiple recommendation objectives effectively, offering a flexible tool for diverse business needs.</description>

      <title>Alternating Iteratively Reweighted $\ell_1$ and Subspace Newton Algorithms for Nonconvex Sparse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17216v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid algorithm for minimizing the sum of a continuously differentiable loss function and a nonsmooth, possibly nonconvex, sparse regularization function. The proposed method alternates between solving a reweighted $\ell_1$-regularized subproblem and performing an inexact subspace Newton step. The reweighted $\ell_1$-subproblem allows for efficient closed-form solutions via the soft-thresholding operator, avoiding the computational overhead of proximity operator calculations. As the algorithm approaches an optimal solution, it maintains a stable support set, ensuring that nonzero components stay uniformly bounded away from zero. It then switches to a perturbed regularized Newton method, further accelerating the convergence. We prove global convergence to a critical point and, under suitable conditions, demonstrate that the algorithm exhibits local linear and quadratic convergence rates. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and solution quality across various model prediction problems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based subsurface CO$_2$ multiphysics monitoring and forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) plays a crucial role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from industrial outputs. Using seismic monitoring can aid in an accurate and robust monitoring system to ensure the effectiveness of CCS and mitigate associated risks. However, conventional seismic wave equation-based approaches are computationally demanding, which hinders real-time applications. In addition to efficiency, forecasting and uncertainty analysis are not easy to handle using such numerical-simulation-based approaches. To this end, we propose a novel subsurface multiphysics monitoring and forecasting framework utilizing video diffusion models. This approach can generate high-quality representations of CO$2$ evolution and associated changes in subsurface elastic properties. With reconstruction guidance, forecasting and inversion can be achieved conditioned on historical frames and/or observational data. Meanwhile, due to the generative nature of the approach, we can quantify uncertainty in the prediction. Tests based on the Compass model show that the proposed method successfully captured the inherently complex physical phenomena associated with CO$_2$ monitoring, and it can predict and invert the subsurface elastic properties and CO$_2$ saturation with consistency in their evolution.</description>

      <title>LLM Stability: A detailed analysis with some surprises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM (large language model) practitioners commonly notice that outputs can vary for the same inputs under settings expected to be deterministic. Yet the questions of how pervasive this is, and with what impact on results, have not to our knowledge been systematically investigated. We investigate non-determinism in five LLMs configured to be deterministic when applied to eight common tasks in across 10 runs, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We see accuracy variations up to 15% across naturally occurring runs with a gap of best possible performance to worst possible performance up to 70%. In fact, none of the LLMs consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks, much less identical output strings. Sharing preliminary results with insiders has revealed that non-determinism perhaps essential to the efficient use of compute resources via co-mingled data in input buffers so this issue is not going away anytime soon. To better quantify our observations, we introduce metrics focused on quantifying determinism, TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement rate of parsed-out answers. Our code and data are publicly available at http://github.com/REDACTED.</description>

      <title>AI in radiological imaging of soft-tissue and bone tumours: a systematic review evaluating against CLAIM and FUTURE-AI guidelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft-tissue and bone tumours (STBT) are rare, diagnostically challenging lesions with variable clinical behaviours and treatment approaches. This systematic review provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods using radiological imaging for diagnosis and prognosis of these tumours, highlighting challenges in clinical translation, and evaluating study alignment with the Checklist for AI in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) and the FUTURE-AI international consensus guidelines for trustworthy and deployable AI to promote the clinical translation of AI methods. The review covered literature from several bibliographic databases, including papers published before 17/07/2024. Original research in peer-reviewed journals focused on radiology-based AI for diagnosing or prognosing primary STBT was included. Exclusion criteria were animal, cadaveric, or laboratory studies, and non-English papers. Abstracts were screened by two of three independent reviewers for eligibility. Eligible papers were assessed against guidelines by one of three independent reviewers. The search identified 15,015 abstracts, from which 325 articles were included for evaluation. Most studies performed moderately on CLAIM, averaging a score of 28.9$\pm$7.5 out of 53, but poorly on FUTURE-AI, averaging 5.1$\pm$2.1 out of 30. Imaging-AI tools for STBT remain at the proof-of-concept stage, indicating significant room for improvement. Future efforts by AI developers should focus on design (e.g. define unmet clinical need, intended clinical setting and how AI would be integrated in clinical workflow), development (e.g. build on previous work, explainability), evaluation (e.g. evaluating and addressing biases, evaluating AI against best practices), and data reproducibility and availability (making documented code and data publicly available). Following these recommendations could improve clinical translation of AI methods.</description>

      <title>Learning out-of-time-ordered correlators with classical kernel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOCs) are widely used to investigate information scrambling in quantum systems. However, directly computing OTOCs with classical computers is an expensive procedure. This is due to the need to classically simulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, which entails computational costs that scale rapidly with system size. Similarly, exact simulation of the dynamics with a quantum computer (QC) will either only be possible for short times with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, or will require a fault-tolerant QC which is currently beyond technological capabilities. This motivates a search for alternative approaches to determine OTOCs and related quantities. In this study, we explore four parameterised sets of Hamiltonians describing local one-dimensional quantum systems of interest in condensed matter physics. For each set, we investigate whether classical kernel methods (KMs) can accurately learn the XZ-OTOC and a particular sum of OTOCs, as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters. We frame the problem as a regression task, generating small batches of labelled data with classical tensor network methods for quantum many-body systems with up to 40 qubits. Using this data, we train a variety of standard kernel machines and observe that the Laplacian and radial basis function (RBF) kernels perform best, achieving a coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) on the testing sets of at least 0.7167, with averages between 0.8112 and 0.9822 for the various sets of Hamiltonians, together with small root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Hence, after training, the models can replace further uses of tensor networks for calculating an OTOC function of a system within the parameterised sets. Accordingly, the proposed method can assist with extensive evaluations of an OTOC function.</description>

      <title>On the Diagram of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods often tackle this by requiring external control mechanisms or multi-model orchestration, which introduces system complexity and typically lacks formal guarantees of reasoning soundness. We introduce the Diagram of Thought (DoT), a framework wherein a single auto-regressive LLM internally constructs and navigates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This DAG represents the iterative reasoning process, encompassing steps like proposing ideas, critiquing them, refining based on feedback, and synthesizing conclusions. This self-orchestrated, self-contained process is guided by learned role-specific tokens (e.g., &lt;proposer&gt;, &lt;critic&gt;, &lt;summarizer&gt;) embedded within the standard generation loop, thereby eliminating external dependencies. Crucially, we establish a rigorous mathematical foundation for DoT using Topos Theory. We formalize the reasoning DAG as a diagram within a suitable topos and prove that the final synthesis step, aggregating validated information, corresponds semantically to computing the colimit of the relevant sub-diagram. This formalization provides theoretical guarantees concerning the logical consistency and robustness of the synthesized outcome. DoT thus offers a unified, self-contained, interpretable, efficient, and formally grounded approach designed to significantly advance the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Says Who? Effective Zero-Shot Annotation of Focalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Focalization, the perspective through which narrative is presented, is encoded via a wide range of lexico-grammatical features and is subject to reader interpretation. Even trained annotators frequently disagree on correct labels, suggesting this task is both qualitatively and computationally challenging. In this work, we test how well five contemporary large language model (LLM) families and two baselines perform when annotating short literary excerpts for focalization. Despite the challenging nature of the task, we find that LLMs show comparable performance to trained human annotators, with GPT-4o achieving an average F1 of 84.79%. Further, we demonstrate that the log probabilities output by GPT-family models frequently reflect the difficulty of annotating particular excerpts. Finally, we provide a case study analyzing sixteen Stephen King novels, demonstrating the usefulness of this approach for computational literary studies and the insights gleaned from examining focalization at scale.</description>

      <title>Incremental Few-Shot Adaptation for Non-Prehensile Object Manipulation using Parallelizable Physics Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-shot adaptation is an important capability for intelligent robots that perform tasks in open-world settings such as everyday environments or flexible production. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for non-prehensile manipulation which incrementally adapts a physics-based dynamics model for model-predictive control (MPC). The model prediction is aligned with a few examples of robot-object interactions collected with the MPC. This is achieved by using a parallelizable rigid-body physics simulation as dynamic world model and sampling-based optimization of the model parameters. In turn, the optimized dynamics model can be used for MPC using efficient sampling-based optimization. We evaluate our few-shot adaptation approach in object pushing experiments in simulation and with a real robot.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Covariate Shift in Imitation Learning for Autonomous Vehicles Using Latent Space Generative World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.</description>

      <title>DeepLTL: Learning to Efficiently Satisfy Complex LTL Specifications for Multi-Task RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently been adopted as a powerful formalism for specifying complex, temporally extended tasks in multi-task reinforcement learning (RL). However, learning policies that efficiently satisfy arbitrary specifications not observed during training remains a challenging problem. Existing approaches suffer from several shortcomings: they are often only applicable to finite-horizon fragments of LTL, are restricted to suboptimal solutions, and do not adequately handle safety constraints. In this work, we propose a novel learning approach to address these concerns. Our method leverages the structure of B\"uchi automata, which explicitly represent the semantics of LTL specifications, to learn policies conditioned on sequences of truth assignments that lead to satisfying the desired formulae. Experiments in a variety of discrete and continuous domains demonstrate that our approach is able to zero-shot satisfy a wide range of finite- and infinite-horizon specifications, and outperforms existing methods in terms of both satisfaction probability and efficiency.

      <title>ScienceAgentBench: Toward Rigorous Assessment of Language Agents for Data-Driven Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancements of large language models (LLMs) have piqued growing interest in developing LLM-based language agents to automate scientific discovery end-to-end, which has sparked both excitement and skepticism about their true capabilities. In this work, we call for rigorous assessment of agents on individual tasks in a scientific workflow before making bold claims on end-to-end automation. To this end, we present ScienceAgentBench, a new benchmark for evaluating language agents for data-driven scientific discovery. To ensure the scientific authenticity and real-world relevance of our benchmark, we extract 102 tasks from 44 peer-reviewed publications in four disciplines and engage nine subject matter experts to validate them. We unify the target output for every task to a self-contained Python program file and employ an array of evaluation metrics to examine the generated programs, execution results, and costs. Each task goes through multiple rounds of manual validation by annotators and subject matter experts to ensure its annotation quality and scientific plausibility. We also propose two effective strategies to mitigate data contamination concerns. Using ScienceAgentBench, we evaluate five open-weight and proprietary LLMs, each with three frameworks: direct prompting, OpenHands CodeAct, and self-debug. Given three attempts for each task, the best-performing agent can only solve 32.4% of the tasks independently and 34.3% with expert-provided knowledge. In addition, we evaluate OpenAI o1-preview with direct prompting and self-debug, which can boost the performance to 42.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of increasing inference-time compute but with more than 10 times the cost of other LLMs. Still, our results underscore the limitations of current language agents in generating code for data-driven discovery, let alone end-to-end automation for scientific research.</description>

      <title>DICE: Discrete Inversion Enabling Controllable Editing for Multinomial Diffusion and Masked Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have achieved success in tasks like image generation and masked language modeling but face limitations in controlled content editing. We introduce DICE (Discrete Inversion for Controllable Editing), the first approach to enable precise inversion for discrete diffusion models, including multinomial diffusion and masked generative models. By recording noise sequences and masking patterns during the reverse diffusion process, DICE enables accurate reconstruction and flexible editing of discrete data without the need for predefined masks or attention manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DICE across both image and text domains, evaluating it on models such as VQ-Diffusion, Paella, and RoBERTa. Our results show that DICE preserves high data fidelity while enhancing editing capabilities, offering new opportunities for fine-grained content manipulation in discrete spaces.</description>

      <title>Nesterov acceleration in benignly non-convex landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While momentum-based optimization algorithms are commonly used in the notoriously non-convex optimization problems of deep learning, their analysis has historically been restricted to the convex and strongly convex setting. In this article, we partially close this gap between theory and practice and demonstrate that virtually identical guarantees can be obtained in optimization problems with a `benign' non-convexity. We show that these weaker geometric assumptions are well justified in overparametrized deep learning, at least locally. Variations of this result are obtained for a continuous time model of Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent algorithm (NAG), the classical discrete time version of NAG, and versions of NAG with stochastic gradient estimates with purely additive noise and with noise that exhibits both additive and multiplicative scaling.</description>

      <title>MMIE: Massive Multimodal Interleaved Comprehension Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</description>

      <title>SensorBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Coding-Based Sensor Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective processing, interpretation, and management of sensor data have emerged as a critical component of cyber-physical systems. Traditionally, processing sensor data requires profound theoretical knowledge and proficiency in signal-processing tools. However, recent works show that Large Language Models (LLMs) have promising capabilities in processing sensory data, suggesting their potential as copilots for developing sensing systems.
  To explore this potential, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, SensorBench, to establish a quantifiable objective. The benchmark incorporates diverse real-world sensor datasets for various tasks. The results show that while LLMs exhibit considerable proficiency in simpler tasks, they face inherent challenges in processing compositional tasks with parameter selections compared to engineering experts. Additionally, we investigate four prompting strategies for sensor processing and show that self-verification can outperform all other baselines in 48% of tasks. Our study provides a comprehensive benchmark and prompting analysis for future developments, paving the way toward an LLM-based sensor processing copilot.</description>

      <title>PortLLM: Personalizing Evolving Large Language Models with Training-Free and Portable Model Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape the AI landscape, fine-tuning pretrained models has become more popular than in the pre-LLM era for achieving optimal performance in domain-specific tasks. However, pretrained LLMs such as ChatGPT are periodically evolved, i.e., model parameters are frequently updated), making it challenging for downstream users with limited resources to keep up with fine-tuning the newest LLMs for their domain application. Even though fine-tuning costs have nowadays been reduced thanks to the innovations of parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA, not all downstream users have adequate computing for frequent personalization. Moreover, access to fine-tuning datasets, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare, could be time-restrictive, making it crucial to retain the knowledge encoded in earlier fine-tuned rounds for future adaptation. In this paper, we present PortLLM, a training-free framework that (i) creates an initial lightweight model update patch to capture domain-specific knowledge, and (ii) allows a subsequent seamless plugging for the continual personalization of evolved LLM at minimal cost. Our extensive experiments cover seven representative datasets, from easier question-answering tasks {BoolQ, SST2} to harder reasoning tasks {WinoGrande, GSM8K}, and models including {Mistral-7B, Llama2, Llama3.1, and Gemma2}, validating the portability of our designed model patches and showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed framework. For instance, PortLLM achieves comparable performance to LoRA fine-tuning with reductions of up to 12.2x in GPU memory usage. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications to understand the portability of our model update patches, which offers new insights into the theoretical dimension of LLMs' personalization.</description>

      <title>Testing Support Size More Efficiently Than Learning Histograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider two problems about an unknown probability distribution $p$:
  1. How many samples from $p$ are required to test if $p$ is supported on $n$ elements or not? Specifically, given samples from $p$, determine whether it is supported on at most $n$ elements, or it is "$\epsilon$-far" (in total variation distance) from being supported on $n$ elements.
  2. Given $m$ samples from $p$, what is the largest lower bound on its support size that we can produce?
  The best known upper bound for problem (1) uses a general algorithm for learning the histogram of the distribution $p$, which requires $\Theta(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon^2 \log n})$ samples. We show that testing can be done more efficiently than learning the histogram, using only $O(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon \log n} \log(1/\epsilon))$ samples, nearly matching the best known lower bound of $\Omega(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon \log n})$. This algorithm also provides a better solution to problem (2), producing larger lower bounds on support size than what follows from previous work. The proof relies on an analysis of Chebyshev polynomial approximations outside the range where they are designed to be good approximations, and the paper is intended as an accessible self-contained exposition of the Chebyshev polynomial method.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Concepts: Sparse Autoencoder Feature Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders have recently produced dictionaries of high-dimensional vectors corresponding to the universe of concepts represented by large language models. We find that this concept universe has interesting structure at three levels: 1) The "atomic" small-scale structure contains "crystals" whose faces are parallelograms or trapezoids, generalizing well-known examples such as (man-woman-king-queen). We find that the quality of such parallelograms and associated function vectors improves greatly when projecting out global distractor directions such as word length, which is efficiently done with linear discriminant analysis. 2) The "brain" intermediate-scale structure has significant spatial modularity; for example, math and code features form a "lobe" akin to functional lobes seen in neural fMRI images. We quantify the spatial locality of these lobes with multiple metrics and find that clusters of co-occurring features, at coarse enough scale, also cluster together spatially far more than one would expect if feature geometry were random. 3) The "galaxy" scale large-scale structure of the feature point cloud is not isotropic, but instead has a power law of eigenvalues with steepest slope in middle layers. We also quantify how the clustering entropy depends on the layer.</description>

Abstract: Creating reinforcement learning agents that generalise effectively to new tasks is a key challenge in AI research. This paper introduces Fracture Cluster Options (FraCOs), a multi-level hierarchical reinforcement learning method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on difficult generalisation tasks. FraCOs identifies patterns in agent behaviour and forms options based on the expected future usefulness of those patterns, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. In tabular settings, FraCOs demonstrates effective transfer and improves performance as it grows in hierarchical depth. We evaluate FraCOs against state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms in several complex procedurally generated environments. Our results show that FraCOs achieves higher in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance than competitors.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Agent Loco-Manipulation for Long-Horizon Quadrupedal Pushing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.</description>

      <title>ADMM for Structured Fractional Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a class of structured fractional minimization problems. The numerator consists of a differentiable function, a simple nonconvex nonsmooth function, a concave nonsmooth function, and a convex nonsmooth function composed with a linear operator. The denominator is a continuous function that is either weakly convex or has a weakly convex square root. These problems are prevalent in various important applications in machine learning and data science. Existing methods, primarily based on subgradient methods and smoothing proximal gradient methods, often suffer from slow convergence and numerical stability issues. In this paper, we introduce {\sf FADMM}, the first Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers tailored for this class of problems. {\sf FADMM} decouples the original problem into linearized proximal subproblems, featuring two variants: one using Dinkelbach's parametric method ({\sf FADMM-D}) and the other using the quadratic transform method ({\sf FADMM-Q}). By introducing a novel Lyapunov function, we establish that {\sf FADMM} converges to $\epsilon$-approximate critical points of the problem within an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{3})$. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including sparse Fisher discriminant analysis, robust Sharpe ratio minimization, and robust sparse recovery, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

      <title>F$^3$OCUS -- Federated Finetuning of Vision-Language Foundation Models with Optimal Client Layer Updating Strategy via Multi-objective Meta-Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective training of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on resource-constrained client devices in Federated Learning (FL) requires the usage of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. To this end, we demonstrate the impact of two factors \textit{viz.}, client-specific layer importance score that selects the most important VLM layers for fine-tuning and inter-client layer diversity score that encourages diverse layer selection across clients for optimal VLM layer selection. We first theoretically motivate and leverage the principal eigenvalue magnitude of layerwise Neural Tangent Kernels and show its effectiveness as client-specific layer importance score. Next, we propose a novel layer updating strategy dubbed F$^3$OCUS that jointly optimizes the layer importance and diversity factors by employing a data-free, multi-objective, meta-heuristic optimization on the server. We explore 5 different meta-heuristic algorithms and compare their effectiveness for selecting model layers and adapter layers towards PEFT-FL. Furthermore, we release a new MedVQA-FL dataset involving overall 707,962 VQA triplets and 9 modality-specific clients and utilize it to train and evaluate our method. Overall, we conduct more than 10,000 client-level experiments on 6 Vision-Language FL task settings involving 58 medical image datasets and 4 different VLM architectures of varying sizes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Are Large Language Models Memorizing Bug Benchmarks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to various software engineering tasks, including code generation, bug detection, and repair. To evaluate model performance in these domains, numerous bug benchmarks containing real-world bugs from software projects have been developed. However, a growing concern within the software engineering community is that these benchmarks may not reliably reflect true LLM performance due to the risk of data leakage. Despite this concern, limited research has been conducted to quantify the impact of potential leakage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate popular LLMs to assess their susceptibility to data leakage from widely used bug benchmarks. To identify potential leakage, we use multiple metrics, including a study of benchmark membership within commonly used training datasets, as well as analyses of negative log-likelihood and n-gram accuracy. Our findings show that certain models, in particular codegen-multi, exhibit significant evidence of memorization in widely used benchmarks like Defects4J, while newer models trained on larger datasets like LLaMa 3.1 exhibit limited signs of leakage. These results highlight the need for careful benchmark selection and the adoption of robust metrics to adequately assess models capabilities.</description>

      <title>Is Training Data Quality or Quantity More Impactful to Small Language Model Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the relative impact of training data quality versus quantity on the performance of small language models (SLMs), utilizing the TinyStories dataset for empirical analysis. Analysis of dataset variations with respect to size (25% and 50% of the original size) and duplication (controlled rates of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) were performed. Model performance was evaluated based on the validation loss, accuracy, and perplexity metrics. Results indicate training data quality plays a more significant role in the overall performance of SLMs, especially given scale of this experiment. Minimal duplication positively impacted model accuracy (+0.87% increase in accuracy at 25% duplication) without significantly increasing perplexity (+0.52% increase going from 0% to 25% duplication) but excessive duplication led to pronounced performance degradation (-40% drop in accuracy at 100% duplication). The implications of this exploration extend beyond just model performance; training large-scale models imposes significant financial and computational burdens, which can be prohibitive for organizations, individuals, and the public at large, especially in developing countries. Additionally, the energy consumption associated with large-scale training raises environmental concerns. Understanding the relative importance of data quality versus quantity could democratize AI technology, making advanced models more accessible and sustainable for all.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication for Joint Image Transmission and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising technology for enhancing communication efficiency. However, most existing research emphasizes single-task reconstruction, neglecting model adaptability and generalization across multi-task systems. In this paper, we propose a novel generative semantic communication system that supports both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Our approach builds upon semantic knowledge bases (KBs) at both the transmitter and receiver, with each semantic KB comprising a source KB and a task KB. The source KB at the transmitter leverages a hierarchical Swin-Transformer, a generative AI scheme, to extract multi-level features from the input image. Concurrently, the counterpart source KB at the receiver utilizes hierarchical residual blocks to generate task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the task KBs adopt a semantic similarity model to map different task requirements into pre-defined task instructions, thereby facilitating the feature selection of the source KBs. Additionally, we develop a unified residual block-based joint source and channel (JSCC) encoder and two task-specific JSCC decoders to achieve the two image tasks. In particular, a generative diffusion model is adopted to construct the JSCC decoder for the image reconstruction task. Experimental results show that our multi-task generative semantic communication system outperforms previous single-task communication systems in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and segmentation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Any-Resolution AI-Generated Image Detection by Spectral Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have established that AI models introduce spectral artifacts into generated images and propose approaches for learning to capture them using labeled data. However, the significant differences in such artifacts among different generative models hinder these approaches from generalizing to generators not seen during training. In this work, we build upon the key idea that the spectral distribution of real images constitutes both an invariant and highly discriminative pattern for AI-generated image detection. To model this under a self-supervised setup, we employ masked spectral learning using the pretext task of frequency reconstruction. Since generated images constitute out-of-distribution samples for this model, we propose spectral reconstruction similarity to capture this divergence. Moreover, we introduce spectral context attention, which enables our approach to efficiently capture subtle spectral inconsistencies in images of any resolution. Our spectral AI-generated image detection approach (SPAI) achieves a 5.5% absolute improvement in AUC over the previous state-of-the-art across 13 recent generative approaches, while exhibiting robustness against common online perturbations.

      <title>STEP: Enhancing Video-LLMs' Compositional Reasoning by Spatio-Temporal Graph-guided Self-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have recently shown strong performance in basic video understanding tasks, such as captioning and coarse-grained question answering, but struggle with compositional reasoning that requires multi-step spatio-temporal inference across object relations, interactions, and events. The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</description>

      <title>Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn, and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser). The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Comprehensive performance evaluations demonstrate that DSC-Diffuser generates realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, providing flexibility and reliable safety assurance in complex multi-task driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of boosted and resolved multi-Higgs-boson events with symmetry-preserving attention networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production of multiple Higgs bosons at the CERN LHC provides a direct way to measure the trilinear and quartic Higgs self-interaction strengths as well as potential access to beyond the standard model effects that can enhance production at large transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The largest event fraction arises from the fully hadronic final state in which every Higgs boson decays to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($b\bar{b}$). This introduces a combinatorial challenge known as the \emph{jet assignment problem}: assigning jets to sets representing Higgs boson candidates. Symmetry-preserving attention networks (SPA-Nets) have been been developed to address this challenge. However, the complexity of jet assignment increases when simultaneously considering both $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ reconstruction possibilities, i.e., two "resolved" small-radius jets each containing a shower initiated by a $b$-quark or one "boosted" large-radius jet containing a merged shower initiated by a $b\bar{b}$ pair. The latter improves the reconstruction efficiency at high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. In this work, we introduce a generalization to the SPA-Net approach to simultaneously consider both boosted and resolved reconstruction possibilities and unambiguously interpret an event as "fully resolved'', "fully boosted", or in between. We report the performance of baseline methods, the original SPA-Net approach, and our generalized version on nonresonant $HH$ and $HHH$ production at the LHC. Considering both boosted and resolved topologies, our SPA-Net approach increases the Higgs boson reconstruction purity by 57--62\% and the efficiency by 23--38\% compared to the baseline method depending on the final state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vulnerability prediction is valuable in identifying security issues efficiently, even though it requires the source code of the target software system, which is a restrictive hypothesis. This paper presents an experimental study to predict vulnerabilities in binary code without source code or complex representations of the binary, leveraging the pivotal idea of decompiling the binary file through neural decompilation and predicting vulnerabilities through deep learning on the decompiled source code. The results outperform the state-of-the-art in both neural decompilation and vulnerability prediction, showing that it is possible to identify vulnerable programs with this approach concerning bi-class (vulnerable/non-vulnerable) and multi-class (type of vulnerability) analysis.</description>

      <title>Barking Up The Syntactic Tree: Enhancing VLM Training with Syntactic Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) implicitly learn to associate image regions with words from large-scale training data, demonstrating an emergent capability for grounding concepts without dense annotations[14,18,51]. However, the coarse-grained supervision from image-caption pairs is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities in object-concept correspondence, even with enormous data volume. Rich semantic and syntactic structures within the text modality have been overlooked as sources of supervision. Starting from contrastive architectures (BLIP and ALBEF) that show strong intrinsic grounding abilities, we propose HIerarchically STructured Learning (HIST). HIST enhances spatial vision-language alignment without using additional human annotations, by hierarchically decomposing captions into the constituent Subjects, Phrases, and Composite Phrases, and enforcing entailment relation between a parent and its children in the hierarchy. Specifically, we introduce two novel loss functions: (1) Subject Loss, which aligns image content with the subject of the corresponding phrase, acting as an entailment of standard contrastive/matching losses at the Phrase level; (2) Composition Loss, to balance attention across multiple objects. HIST is general, and can be applied to any VLM for which attention between vision and language can be computed. Compared to baseline VLMs, HIST achieves up to +9.8% improvement in visual grounding and +6.3% in multi-object referring segmentation. Surprisingly, the improved spatial grounding leads to improvements in other downstream VLM tasks: +1.1% in image-text retrieval, and +0.2% in visual question answering.</description>

      <title>Evil twins are not that evil: Qualitative insights into machine-generated prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been widely observed that language models (LMs) respond in predictable ways to algorithmically generated prompts that are seemingly unintelligible. This is both a sign that we lack a full understanding of how LMs work, and a practical challenge, because opaqueness can be exploited for harmful uses of LMs, such as jailbreaking. We present the first thorough analysis of opaque machine-generated prompts, or autoprompts, pertaining to 6 LMs of different sizes and families. We find that machine-generated prompts are characterized by a last token that is often intelligible and strongly affects the generation. A small but consistent proportion of the previous tokens are prunable, probably appearing in the prompt as a by-product of the fact that the optimization process fixes the number of tokens. The remaining tokens fall into two categories: filler tokens, which can be replaced with semantically unrelated substitutes, and keywords, that tend to have at least a loose semantic relation with the generation, although they do not engage in well-formed syntactic relations with it. Additionally, human experts can reliably identify the most influential tokens in an autoprompt a posteriori, suggesting these prompts are not entirely opaque. Finally, some of the ablations we applied to autoprompts yield similar effects in natural language inputs, suggesting that autoprompts emerge naturally from the way LMs process linguistic inputs in general.</description>

      <title>KG4Diagnosis: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent LLM Framework with Knowledge Graph Enhancement for Medical Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16833v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare diagnosis demands systematic frameworks that can handle complex medical scenarios while maintaining specialized expertise. We present KG4Diagnosis, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that combines LLMs with automated knowledge graph construction, encompassing 362 common diseases across medical specialties. Our framework mirrors real-world medical systems through a two-tier architecture: a general practitioner (GP) agent for initial assessment and triage, coordinating with specialized agents for in-depth diagnosis in specific domains. The core innovation lies in our end-to-end knowledge graph generation methodology, incorporating: (1) semantic-driven entity and relation extraction optimized for medical terminology, (2) multi-dimensional decision relationship reconstruction from unstructured medical texts, and (3) human-guided reasoning for knowledge expansion. KG4Diagnosis serves as an extensible foundation for specialized medical diagnosis systems, with capabilities to incorporate new diseases and medical knowledge. The framework's modular design enables seamless integration of domain-specific enhancements, making it valuable for developing targeted medical diagnosis systems. We provide architectural guidelines and protocols to facilitate adoption across medical contexts.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet regression with implicit denoising and multicollinearity reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fr\'echet regression extends linear regression to model complex responses
  in metric spaces, making it particularly relevant for multi-label regression,
  where eachinstance can have multiple associated labels. However, addressing
  noise and dependencies among predictors within this framework remains un derexplored. In this paper, we present an extension of the Global Fr\'echet re gression model that enables explicit modeling of relationships between input
  variables and multiple responses. To address challenges arising from noise
  and multicollinearity, we propose a novel framework based on implicit regu larization, which preserves the intrinsic structure of the data while effectively
  capturing complex dependencies. Our approach ensures accurate and efficient
  modeling without the biases introduced by traditional explicit regularization
  methods. Theoretical guarantees are provided, and the performance of the
  proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Merging Feed-Forward Sublayers for Compressed Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise and ubiquity of larger deep learning models, the need for high-quality compression techniques is growing in order to deploy these models widely. The sheer parameter count of these models makes it difficult to fit them into the memory constraints of different hardware. In this work, we present a novel approach to model compression by merging similar parameter groups within a model, rather than pruning away less important parameters. Specifically, we select, align, and merge separate feed-forward sublayers in Transformer models, and test our method on language modeling, image classification, and machine translation. With our method, we demonstrate performance comparable to the original models while combining more than a third of model feed-forward sublayers, and demonstrate improved performance over a strong layer-pruning baseline. For instance, we can remove over 21% of total parameters from a Vision Transformer, while maintaining 99% of its original performance. Additionally, we observe that some groups of feed-forward sublayers exhibit high activation similarity, which may help explain their surprising mergeability.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Optimization of Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Survey and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in limited-data regimes. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data. However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with significant challenges. This review examines PINNs for the first time in terms of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed, precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest are the gradient-free methods of neuroevolution for optimizing the uniquely complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient descent and neuroevolution for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple conflicting terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research. Yet another exciting track is to cast neuroevolution as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of pullback attractors in recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are high-dimensional state space models capable of learning functions on sequence data. Recently, it has been conjectured that reservoir computers, a particular class of RNNs, trained on observations of a dynamical systems can be interpreted as embeddings. This result has been established for the case of linear reservoir systems. In this work, we use a nonautonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the subset of reservoir state space approximated during training and prediction phase. We prove that when the input sequences comes from an Nin-dimensional invertible dynamical system, the fractal dimension of this set is bounded above by Nin. The result obtained here are useful in dimensionality reduction of computation in RNNs as well as estimating fractal dimensions of dynamical systems from limited observations of their time series. It is also a step towards understanding embedding properties of reservoir computers.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and Boosting the Power of Fine-Grained Visual Recognition for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in various visual understanding tasks. However, MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR), which aims to identify subordinate-level categories from images. This can negatively impact more advanced capabilities of MLLMs, such as object-centric visual question answering and reasoning. In our study, we revisit three quintessential capabilities of MLLMs for FGVR, including object information extraction, category knowledge reserve, object-category alignment, and position of the root cause as a misalignment problem. To address this issue, we present Finedefics, an MLLM that enhances the model's FGVR capability by incorporating informative attribute descriptions of objects into the training phase. We employ contrastive learning on object-attribute pairs and attribute-category pairs simultaneously and use examples from similar but incorrect categories as hard negatives, naturally bringing representations of visual objects and category names closer. Extensive evaluations across multiple popular FGVR datasets demonstrate that Finedefics outperforms existing MLLMs of comparable parameter sizes, showcasing its remarkable efficacy. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ICST-MIPL/Finedefics_ICLR2025.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Bayesian Approach for System Identification based on Linear Gaussian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of system identification, where we select inputs, observe the corresponding outputs from the true system, and optimize the parameters of our model to best fit the data. We propose a flexible and computationally tractable methodology that is compatible with any system and parametric family of models. Our approach only requires input-output data from the system and first-order information from the model with respect to the parameters. Our algorithm consists of two modules. First, we formulate the problem of system identification from a Bayesian perspective and use a linear Gaussian model approximation to iteratively optimize the model's parameters. In each iteration, we propose to use the input-output data to tune the covariance of the linear Gaussian model. This statistically calibrates the approach. Secondly, we define a Gaussian-based uncertainty measure for the model parameters, which we can then minimize with respect to the next selected input. We test our method with linear and nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>PhD Knowledge Not Required: A Reasoning Challenge for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for frontier models often test specialized, "PhD-level" knowledge that is difficult for non-experts to grasp. In contrast, we present a benchmark with 594 problems based on the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge that requires only general knowledge. Our benchmark is challenging for both humans and models; however correct solutions are easy to verify, and models' mistakes are easy to spot. As LLMs are more widely deployed in society, we believe it is useful to develop benchmarks for frontier models that humans can understand without the need for deep domain expertise.
  Our work reveals capability gaps that are not evident in existing benchmarks: OpenAI o1 significantly outperforms other reasoning models on our benchmark, despite being on par with other models when tested on benchmarks that test specialized knowledge. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning outputs uncovers new kinds of failures. DeepSeek R1, for instance, often concedes with "I give up" before providing an answer that it knows is wrong. R1 can also be remarkably "uncertain" in its output and in rare cases, it does not "finish thinking," which suggests the need for techniques to "wrap up" before the context window limit is reached. We also quantify the effectiveness of reasoning longer to identify the point beyond which more reasoning is unlikely to improve accuracy on our benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MvC) utilizes information from multiple views to uncover the underlying structures of data. Despite significant advancements in MvC, mitigating the impact of missing samples in specific views on the integration of knowledge from different views remains a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel Mask-informed Deep Contrastive Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (Mask-IMvC) method, which elegantly identifies a view-common representation for clustering. Specifically, we introduce a mask-informed fusion network that aggregates incomplete multi-view information while considering the observation status of samples across various views as a mask, thereby reducing the adverse effects of missing values. Additionally, we design a prior knowledge-assisted contrastive learning loss that boosts the representation capability of the aggregated view-common representation by injecting neighborhood information of samples from different views. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Mask-IMvC method over state-of-the-art approaches across multiple MvC datasets, both in complete and incomplete scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodological framework for detecting and classifying latent constructs, including frames, narratives, and topics, from textual data using Open-Source Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed hybrid approach combines automated summarization with human-in-the-loop validation to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of construct identification. By employing iterative sampling coupled with expert refinement, the framework guarantees methodological robustness and ensures conceptual precision. Applied to diverse data sets, including AI policy debates, newspaper articles on encryption, and the 20 Newsgroups data set, this approach demonstrates its versatility in systematically analyzing complex political discourses, media framing, and topic classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Capability Boundary of DeepSeek Models: An Application-Driven Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11164v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DeepSeek-R1, known for its low training cost and exceptional reasoning capabilities, has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. However, detailed evaluations for DeepSeek Series models from the perspective of real-world applications are lacking, making it challenging for users to select the most suitable DeepSeek models for their specific needs. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic evaluation of the DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama series, their corresponding 4-bit quantized models, and the reasoning model QwQ-32B using the enhanced A-Eval benchmark, A-Eval-2.0. Through a comparative analysis of original instruction-tuned models and their distilled counterparts, we investigate how reasoning enhancements impact performance across diverse practical tasks. To assist users in model selection, we quantify the capability boundary of DeepSeek models through performance tier classifications. Based on the quantification results, we develop a model selection handbook that clearly illustrates the relation among models, their capabilities and practical applications. This handbook enables users to select the most cost-effective models without efforts, ensuring optimal performance and resource efficiency in real-world applications. It should be noted that, despite our efforts to establish a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative evaluation benchmark, the selection of test samples, characteristics of data distribution, and the setting of evaluation criteria may inevitably introduce certain biases into the evaluation results. We will continuously optimize the evaluation benchmarks and periodically update this paper to provide more comprehensive and accurate evaluation results. Please refer to the latest version of the paper for the most current results and conclusions.</description>

      <title>Machine-generated text detection prevents language model collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their generated outputs are proliferating across the web, risking a future where machine-generated content dilutes human-authored text. Since online data is the primary resource for LLM pre-training, subsequent models could be trained on an unknown portion of synthetic samples. This will lead to model collapse, a degenerative process whereby LLMs reinforce their own errors, and ultimately yield a declining performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of decoding strategy on model collapse, analysing the characteristics of text at each model generation, the similarity to human references, and the resulting model performance. Using the decoding strategies that lead to the most significant degradation, we evaluate model collapse in more realistic scenarios where the origin of the data (human or synthetic) is unknown. We train a machine-generated text detector and propose an importance sampling approach to alleviate model collapse. Our method is validated on two LLM variants (GPT-2 and SmolLM2) on the open-ended text generation task. We demonstrate that it can not only prevent model collapse but also improve performance when sufficient human-authored samples are present.</description>

      <title>Tool or Tutor? Experimental evidence from AI deployment in cancer diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Professionals increasingly use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance their capabilities and assist with task execution. While prior research has examined these uses separately, their potential interaction remains underexplored. We propose that AI-driven training ("tutor") and AI-assisted task completion ("tool") can have a joint effect on human capability and test this hypothesis in the context of lung cancer diagnosis. In a field experiment with 336 medical students, we manipulated AI deployment in training, in practice, and in both. Our findings reveal that while AI-integrated training and AI assistance independently improved diagnostic performance, their combination yielded the highest accuracy. These results underscore AI's dual role in enhancing human performance through both learning and real-time support, offering insights into AI deployment in professional settings where human expertise remains essential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We release 70,509 high-quality social networks extracted from multilingual fiction and nonfiction narratives. We additionally provide metadata for $\sim$30,000 of these texts (73\% nonfiction and 27\% fiction) written between 1800 and 1999 in 58 languages. This dataset provides information on historical social worlds at an unprecedented scale, including data for 2,510,021 individuals in 2,805,482 pair-wise relationships annotated for affinity and relationship type. We achieve this scale by automating previously manual methods of extracting social networks; specifically, we adapt an existing annotation task as a language model prompt, ensuring consistency at scale with the use of structured output. This dataset serves as a unique resource for humanities and social science research by providing data on cognitive models of social realities.</description>

      <title>Triple Phase Transitions: Understanding the Learning Dynamics of Large Language Models from a Neuroscience Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit abrupt emergent behavior, whereby new abilities arise at certain points during their training. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as a ''phase transition'', remains poorly understood. In this study, we conduct an integrative analysis of such phase transitions by examining three interconnected perspectives: the similarity between LLMs and the human brain, the internal states of LLMs, and downstream task performance. We propose a novel interpretation for the learning dynamics of LLMs that vary in both training data and architecture, revealing that three phase transitions commonly emerge across these models during training: (1) alignment with the entire brain surges as LLMs begin adhering to task instructions Brain Alignment and Instruction Following, (2) unexpectedly, LLMs diverge from the brain during a period in which downstream task accuracy temporarily stagnates Brain Detachment and Stagnation, and (3) alignment with the brain reoccurs as LLMs become capable of solving the downstream tasks Brain Realignment and Consolidation. These findings illuminate the underlying mechanisms of phase transitions in LLMs, while opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research bridging AI and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>ADAGE: Active Defenses Against GNN Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world applications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and recommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise turns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work has revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large and diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging from node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of the target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in the threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses challenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing setup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies rather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and general Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). By analyzing the queries to the GNN, tracking their diversity in terms of proximity to different communities identified in the underlying graph, and increasing the defense strength with the growing fraction of communities that have been queried, ADAGE can prevent stealing in all common attack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark datasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that ADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible, whilst not harming predictive performance for legitimate users. ADAGE, thereby, contributes towards securely sharing valuable GNNs in the future.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Distributed Optimization with Compression and Error Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning tasks often involve massive datasets and models, necessitating distributed optimization algorithms with reduced communication overhead. Communication compression, where clients transmit compressed updates to a central server, has emerged as a key technique to mitigate communication bottlenecks. However, the theoretical understanding of stochastic distributed optimization with contractive compression remains limited, particularly in conjunction with Nesterov acceleration -- a cornerstone for achieving faster convergence in optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, ADEF (Accelerated Distributed Error Feedback), which integrates Nesterov acceleration, contractive compression, error feedback, and gradient difference compression. We prove that ADEF achieves the first accelerated convergence rate for stochastic distributed optimization with contractive compression in the general convex regime. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of ADEF in reducing communication costs while maintaining fast convergence.</description>

      <title>Internet of Things-Based Smart Precision Farming in Soilless Agriculture:Opportunities and Challenges for Global Food Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population and the continuous decline in cultivable land pose significant threats to food security. This challenge worsens as climate change further reduces the availability of farmland. Soilless agriculture, such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, offers a sustainable solution by enabling efficient crop cultivation in controlled environments. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart precision farming improves resource efficiency, automates environmental control, and ensures stable and high-yield crop production. IoT-enabled smart farming systems utilize real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and automation to optimize water and nutrient usage while minimizing human intervention. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of IoT-based soilless farming, highlighting its role in sustainable agriculture, urban farming, and global food security. These advanced farming methods ensure greater productivity, resource conservation, and year-round cultivation. However, they also face challenges such as high initial investment, technological dependency, and energy consumption. Through a comprehensive study, bibliometric analysis, and comparative analysis, this research highlights current trends and research gaps. It also outlines future directions for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to drive innovation and scalability in IoT-driven soilless agriculture. By emphasizing the benefits of vertical farming and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)-enabled soilless techniques, this paper supports informed decision-making to address food security challenges and promote sustainable agricultural innovations.</description>

      <title>Self-Vocabularizing Training for Neural Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Past vocabulary learning techniques identify relevant vocabulary before training, relying on statistical and entropy-based assumptions that largely neglect the role of model training. Empirically, we observe that trained translation models are induced to use a byte-pair encoding (BPE) vocabulary subset distinct from the original BPE vocabulary, leading to performance improvements when retrained with the induced vocabulary. In this paper, we analyze this discrepancy in neural machine translation by examining vocabulary and entropy shifts during self-training--where each iteration generates a labeled dataset by pairing source sentences with the model's predictions to define a new vocabulary. Building on these insights, we propose self-vocabularizing training, an iterative method that self-selects a smaller, more optimal vocabulary, yielding up to a 1.49 BLEU improvement. Moreover, we find that deeper model architectures lead to both an increase in unique token usage and a 6-8% reduction in vocabulary size.</description>

      <title>RWKV-7 "Goose" with Expressive Dynamic State Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present RWKV-7 "Goose", a new sequence modeling architecture with constant memory usage and constant inference time per token. Despite being trained on dramatically fewer tokens than other top models, our 2.9 billion parameter language model achieves a new 3B SoTA on multilingual tasks and matches the current 3B SoTA on English language downstream performance. RWKV-7 introduces a newly generalized formulation of the delta rule with vector-valued gating and in-context learning rates, as well as a relaxed value replacement rule. We show that RWKV-7 can perform state tracking and recognize all regular languages, while retaining parallelizability of training. This exceeds the capabilities of Transformers under standard complexity conjectures, which are limited to $\mathsf{TC}^0$. To demonstrate RWKV-7's language modeling capability, we also present an extended open source 3.1 trillion token multilingual corpus, and train four RWKV-7 models ranging from 0.19 billion to 2.9 billion parameters on this dataset.
  To foster openness, reproduction, and adoption, we release our models and dataset component listing at https://huggingface.co/RWKV, and our training and inference code at https://github.com/RWKV/RWKV-LM all under the Apache 2.0 License.</description>

      <title>Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress on AI benchmarks, the real-world meaning of benchmark performance remains unclear. To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a month.</description>

      <title>Interpretability of Graph Neural Networks to Assess Effects of Global Change Drivers on Ecological Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pollinators play a crucial role for plant reproduction, either in natural ecosystem or in human-modified landscape. Global change drivers,including climate change or land use modifications, can alter the plant-pollinator interactions. To assess the potential influence of global change drivers on pollination, large-scale interactions, climate and land use data are required. While recent machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), allow the analysis of such datasets, interpreting their results can be challenging. We explore existing methods for interpreting GNNs in order to highlight the effects of various environmental covariates on pollination network connectivity. A large simulation study is performed to confirm whether these methods can detect the interactive effect between a covariate and a genus of plant on connectivity, and whether the application of debiasing techniques influences the estimation of these effects. An application on the Spipoll dataset, with and without accounting for sampling effects, highlights the potential impact of land use on network connectivity and shows that accounting for sampling effects partially alters the estimation of these effects.</description>

      <title>Token Dynamics: Towards Efficient and Dynamic Video Token Representation for Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Token-based video representation has emerged as a promising approach for enabling LLMs to interpret video content. However, existing token reduction, such as token pruning and token merging, often disrupt essential spatial-temporal positional embeddings, failing to adequately balance computational efficiency with fewer tokens. Consequently, these methods result in lengthy token sequences, limiting their applicability in scenarios requiring extreme token compression, such as video large language models. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of extreme short token reduction, aiming to represent extensive video sequences with a minimal number of tokens. To address this challenge, we propose Token Dynamics, a new video representation framework that dynamically reduces token count while preserving spatial-temporal coherence. Specifically, we disentangle video representations by separating visual embeddings from grid-level motion information, structuring them into: 1. a concise token hash table, created by clustering tokens that describe object-level content; 2. a token indices key map, capturing detailed spatial-temporal motion patterns across grids; 3. a token hash function, which vector-quantizes the token hash table to reconstruct the token sequence from the key map. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-dynamics attention mechanism that integrates motion features into the token base without increasing token length, thereby maintaining compactness and spatial-temporal integrity. The experiments demonstrate a reduction of token count to merely 0.07% of the original tokens, with only a minor performance drop of 1.13%. Additionally, we propose two novel subtasks within extreme token reduction (fixed-length and adaptive-length compression). Our method offers significantly lower theoretical complexity, fewer tokens, and enhanced throughput, thus providing an efficient solution for video LLMs.</description>

      <title>Learning Beamforming Codebooks for Active Sensing with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the design of beamforming codebooks for the base station (BS) and for the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in an active sensing scheme for uplink localization, in which the mobile user transmits a sequence of pilots to the BS through reflection at the RISs, and the BS and the RISs are adaptively configured by carefully choosing BS beamforming codeword and RIS codewords from their respective codebooks in a sequential manner to progressively focus onto the user. Most existing codebook designs for RIS are not tailored for active sensing, by which we mean the choice of the next codeword should depend on the measurements made so far, and the sequence of codewords should dynamically focus reflection toward the user. Moreover, most existing codeword selection methods rely on exhaustive search in beam training to identify the codeword with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus incurring substantial pilot overhead as the size of the codebook scales. This paper proposes a learning-based approach for codebook construction and for codeword selection for active sensing. The proposed learning approach aims to locate a target in the service area by recursively selecting a sequence of BS beamforming codewords and RIS codewords from the respective codebooks as more measurements become available without exhaustive beam training. The codebook design and the codeword selection fuse key ideas from the vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn respectively the discrete function space of the codebook and the temporal dependencies between measurements.</description>

      <title>RGB-Th-Bench: A Dense benchmark for Visual-Thermal Understanding of Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RGB-Th-Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to comprehend RGB-Thermal image pairs. While VLMs have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual reasoning and multimodal understanding, their evaluation has been predominantly limited to RGB-based benchmarks, leaving a critical gap in assessing their capabilities in infrared vision tasks. Existing visible-infrared datasets are either task-specific or lack high-quality annotations necessary for rigorous model evaluation. To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of 1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions. The benchmark employs two accuracy metrics: a standard question-level accuracy and a stricter skill-level accuracy, which evaluates model robustness across multiple questions within each skill dimension. This design ensures a thorough assessment of model performance, including resilience to adversarial and hallucinated responses. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing significant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding. Our results show that even the strongest models struggle with thermal image comprehension, with performance heavily constrained by their RGB-based capabilities. Additionally, the lack of large-scale application-specific and expert-annotated thermal-caption-pair datasets in pre-training is an important reason of the observed performance gap. RGB-Th-Bench highlights the urgent need for further advancements in multimodal learning to bridge the gap between visible and thermal image understanding. The dataset is available through this link, and the evaluation code will also be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Effective Skill Unlearning through Intervention and Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable skills across various domains. Understanding the mechanisms behind their abilities and implementing controls over them is becoming increasingly important for developing better models. In this paper, we focus on skill unlearning in LLMs, specifically unlearning a particular skill while retaining their overall capabilities. We introduce two lightweight, training-free machine skill unlearning techniques for LLMs. First, we observe that the pre-activation distribution of neurons in each Feed-Forward Layer (FFL) differs when the model demonstrates different skills. Additionally, we find that queries triggering the same skill cluster within the FFL key space and can be separated from other queries using a hypercube. Based on these observations, we propose two lightweight, training-free skill unlearning methods via \textit{intervention} and \textit{abstention} respectively: \texttt{Neuron Adjust} and \texttt{Key Space Detection}. We evaluate our methods on unlearning math-solving, Python-coding, and comprehension skills across seven different languages. The results demonstrate their strong unlearning capabilities for the designated skills. Specifically, \texttt{Key Space Detection} achieves over 80\% relative performance drop on the forgetting skill and less than 10\% relative performance drop on other skills and the model's general knowledge (MMLU) for most unlearning tasks.

      <title>Pharmolix-FM: All-Atom Foundation Models for Molecular Modeling and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural biology relies on accurate three-dimensional biomolecular structures to advance our understanding of biological functions, disease mechanisms, and therapeutics. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of all-atom foundation models for molecular modeling and generation, existing approaches face challenges in generalization due to the multi-modal nature of atomic data and the lack of comprehensive analysis of training and sampling strategies. To address these limitations, we propose PharMolixFM, a unified framework for constructing all-atom foundation models based on multi-modal generative techniques. Our framework includes three variants using state-of-the-art multi-modal generative models. By formulating molecular tasks as a generalized denoising process with task-specific priors, PharMolixFM achieves robust performance across various structural biology applications. Experimental results demonstrate that PharMolixFM-Diff achieves competitive prediction accuracy in protein-small-molecule docking (83.9% vs. 90.2% RMSD &lt; 2{\AA}, given pocket) with significantly improved inference speed. Moreover, we explore the empirical inference scaling law by introducing more sampling repeats or steps. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the sequential multi-object robotic grasp sampling algorithm SeqGrasp that can robustly synthesize stable grasps on diverse objects using the robotic hand's partial Degrees of Freedom (DoF). We use SeqGrasp to construct the large-scale Allegro Hand sequential grasping dataset SeqDataset and use it for training the diffusion-based sequential grasp generator SeqDiffuser. We experimentally evaluate SeqGrasp and SeqDiffuser against the state-of-the-art non-sequential multi-object grasp generation method MultiGrasp in simulation and on a real robot. The experimental results demonstrate that SeqGrasp and SeqDiffuser reach an 8.71%-43.33% higher grasp success rate than MultiGrasp. Furthermore, SeqDiffuser is approximately 1000 times faster at generating grasps than SeqGrasp and MultiGrasp.</description>
