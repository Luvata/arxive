      <title>Think Smarter not Harder: Adaptive Reasoning with Inference Aware Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving mathematics problems has been an intriguing capability of large language models, and many efforts have been made to improve reasoning by extending reasoning length, such as through self-correction and extensive long chain-of-thoughts. While promising in problem-solving, advanced long reasoning chain models exhibit an undesired single-modal behavior, where trivial questions require unnecessarily tedious long chains of thought. In this work, we propose a way to allow models to be aware of inference budgets by formulating it as utility maximization with respect to an inference budget constraint, hence naming our algorithm Inference Budget-Constrained Policy Optimization (IBPO). In a nutshell, models fine-tuned through IBPO learn to ``understand'' the difficulty of queries and allocate inference budgets to harder ones. With different inference budgets, our best models are able to have a $4.14$\% and $5.74$\% absolute improvement ($8.08$\% and $11.2$\% relative improvement) on MATH500 using $2.16$x and $4.32$x inference budgets respectively, relative to LLaMA3.1 8B Instruct. These improvements are approximately $2$x those of self-consistency under the same budgets.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Monte-Carlo Tree Search Approach for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a well-known optimization problem in manufacturing, where the goal is to determine the optimal sequence of jobs across different machines to minimize a given objective. In this work, we focus on minimising the weighted sum of job completion times. We explore the potential of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a heuristic-based reinforcement learning technique, to solve large-scale JSSPs, especially those with recirculation. We propose several Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulations to model the JSSP for the MCTS algorithm. In addition, we introduce a new synthetic benchmark derived from real manufacturing data, which captures the complexity of large, non-rectangular instances often encountered in practice. Our experimental results show that MCTS effectively produces good-quality solutions for large-scale JSSP instances, outperforming our constraint programming approach.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Think Too Fast To Explore Effectively</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models have emerged many intellectual capacities. While numerous benchmarks assess their intelligence, limited attention has been given to their ability to explore, an essential capacity for discovering new information and adapting to novel environments in both natural and artificial systems. The extent to which LLMs can effectively explore, particularly in open-ended tasks, remains unclear. This study investigates whether LLMs can surpass humans in exploration during an open-ended task, using Little Alchemy 2 as a paradigm, where agents combine elements to discover new ones. Results show most LLMs underperform compared to humans, except for the o1 model, with those traditional LLMs relying primarily on uncertainty driven strategies, unlike humans who balance uncertainty and empowerment. Representational analysis of the models with Sparse Autoencoders revealed that uncertainty and choices are represented at earlier transformer blocks, while empowerment values are processed later, causing LLMs to think too fast and make premature decisions, hindering effective exploration. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLM exploration and suggest directions for improving their adaptability.</description>

      <title>Normative Evaluation of Large Language Models with Everyday Moral Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has spurred extensive research into their encoded moral norms and decision-making processes. Much of this research relies on prompting LLMs with survey-style questions to assess how well models are aligned with certain demographic groups, moral beliefs, or political ideologies. While informative, the adherence of these approaches to relatively superficial constructs tends to oversimplify the complexity and nuance underlying everyday moral dilemmas. We argue that auditing LLMs along more detailed axes of human interaction is of paramount importance to better assess the degree to which they may impact human beliefs and actions. To this end, we evaluate LLMs on complex, everyday moral dilemmas sourced from the "Am I the Asshole" (AITA) community on Reddit, where users seek moral judgments on everyday conflicts from other community members. We prompted seven LLMs to assign blame and provide explanations for over 10,000 AITA moral dilemmas. We then compared the LLMs' judgments and explanations to those of Redditors and to each other, aiming to uncover patterns in their moral reasoning. Our results demonstrate that large language models exhibit distinct patterns of moral judgment, varying substantially from human evaluations on the AITA subreddit. LLMs demonstrate moderate to high self-consistency but low inter-model agreement. Further analysis of model explanations reveals distinct patterns in how models invoke various moral principles. These findings highlight the complexity of implementing consistent moral reasoning in artificial systems and the need for careful evaluation of how different models approach ethical judgment. As LLMs continue to be used in roles requiring ethical decision-making such as therapists and companions, careful evaluation is crucial to mitigate potential biases and limitations.</description>

      <title>Learning to Plan &amp; Reason for Evaluation with Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences intended to capture the step-bystep reasoning process that underlies the final evaluation of a response. However, due to the lack of human annotated CoTs for evaluation, the required components and structure of effective reasoning traces remain understudied. Consequently, previous approaches often (1) constrain reasoning traces to hand-designed components, such as a list of criteria, reference answers, or verification questions and (2) structure them such that planning is intertwined with the reasoning for evaluation. In this work, we propose EvalPlanner, a preference optimization algorithm for Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge that first generates an unconstrained evaluation plan, followed by its execution, and then the final judgment. In a self-training loop, EvalPlanner iteratively optimizes over synthetically constructed evaluation plans and executions, leading to better final verdicts. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for generative reward models on RewardBench (with a score of 93.9), despite being trained on fewer amount of, and synthetically generated, preference pairs. Additional experiments on other benchmarks like RM-Bench, JudgeBench, and FollowBenchEval further highlight the utility of both planning and reasoning for building robust LLM-as-a-Judge reasoning models.</description>

      <title>Economic Rationality under Specialization: Evidence of Decision Bias in AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study by Chen et al. (2023) [01], the large language model GPT demonstrated economic rationality comparable to or exceeding the average human level in tasks such as budget allocation and risk preference. Building on this finding, this paper further incorporates specialized agents, such as biotechnology experts and economists, for a horizontal comparison to explore whether specialization can enhance or maintain economic rationality equivalent to that of GPT in similar decision-making scenarios. The results indicate that when agents invest more effort in specialized fields, their decision-making behavior is more prone to 'rationality shift,' specifically manifested as increased violations of GARP (Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference), decreased CCEI (Critical Cost Efficiency Index), and more significant decision deviations under high-risk conditions. In contrast, GPT and more generalized basic agents maintain a more stable and consistent level of rationality across multiple tasks. This study reveals the inherent conflict between specialization and economic rationality, providing new insights for constructing AI decision-making systems that balance specialization and generalization across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator based Reinforcement Learning for Control of first-order PDEs with Spatially-Varying State Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of distributed parameter systems affected by delays is a challenging task, particularly when the delays depend on spatial variables. The idea of integrating analytical control theory with learning-based control within a unified control scheme is becoming increasingly promising and advantageous. In this paper, we address the problem of controlling an unstable first-order hyperbolic PDE with spatially-varying delays by combining PDE backstepping control strategies and deep reinforcement learning (RL). To eliminate the assumption on the delay function required for the backstepping design, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC) architecture incorporating a DeepONet to approximate the backstepping controller. The DeepONet extracts features from the backstepping controller and feeds them into the policy network. In simulations, our algorithm outperforms the baseline SAC without prior backstepping knowledge and the analytical controller.</description>

      <title>On Scaling Neurosymbolic Programming through Guided Logical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic neurosymbolic learning seeks to integrate neural networks with symbolic programming. Many state-of-the-art systems rely on a reduction to the Probabilistic Weighted Model Counting Problem (PWMC), which requires computing a Boolean formula called the logical provenance.However, PWMC is \\#P-hard, and the number of clauses in the logical provenance formula can grow exponentially, creating a major bottleneck that significantly limits the applicability of PNL solutions in practice.We propose a new approach centered around an exact algorithm DPNL, that enables bypassing the computation of the logical provenance.The DPNL approach relies on the principles of an oracle and a recursive DPLL-like decomposition in order to guide and speed up logical inference.Furthermore, we show that this approach can be adapted for approximate reasoning with $\epsilon$ or $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees, called ApproxDPNL.Experiments show significant performance gains.DPNL enables scaling exact inference further, resulting in more accurate models.Further, ApproxDPNL shows potential for advancing the scalability of neurosymbolic programming by incorporating approximations even further, while simultaneously ensuring guarantees for the reasoning process.</description>

      <title>CueTip: An Interactive and Explainable Physics-aware Pool Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interactive and explainable automated coaching assistant called CueTip for a variant of pool/billiards. CueTip's novelty lies in its combination of three features: a natural-language interface, an ability to perform contextual, physics-aware reasoning, and that its explanations are rooted in a set of predetermined guidelines developed by domain experts. We instrument a physics simulator so that it generates event traces in natural language alongside traditional state traces. Event traces lend themselves to interpretation by language models, which serve as the interface to our assistant. We design and train a neural adaptor that decouples tactical choices made by CueTip from its interactivity and explainability allowing it to be reconfigured to mimic any pool playing agent. Our experiments show that CueTip enables contextual query-based assistance and explanations while maintaining the strength of the agent in terms of win rate (improving it in some situations). The explanations generated by CueTip are physically-aware and grounded in the expert rules and are therefore more reliable.</description>

      <title>Extending the design space of ontologization practices: Using bCLEARer as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our aim in this paper is to outline how the design space for the ontologization process is richer than current practice would suggest. We point out that engineering processes as well as products need to be designed - and identify some components of the design. We investigate the possibility of designing a range of radically new practices, providing examples of the new practices from our work over the last three decades with an outlier methodology, bCLEARer. We also suggest that setting an evolutionary context for ontologization helps one to better understand the nature of these new practices and provides the conceptual scaffolding that shapes fertile processes. Where this evolutionary perspective positions digitalization (the evolutionary emergence of computing technologies) as the latest step in a long evolutionary trail of information transitions. This reframes ontologization as a strategic tool for leveraging the emerging opportunities offered by digitalization.</description>

      <title>Model-Free RL Agents Demonstrate System 1-Like Intentionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper argues that model-free reinforcement learning (RL) agents, while lacking explicit planning mechanisms, exhibit behaviours that can be analogised to System 1 ("thinking fast") processes in human cognition. Unlike model-based RL agents, which operate akin to System 2 ("thinking slow") reasoning by leveraging internal representations for planning, model-free agents react to environmental stimuli without anticipatory modelling. We propose a novel framework linking the dichotomy of System 1 and System 2 to the distinction between model-free and model-based RL. This framing challenges the prevailing assumption that intentionality and purposeful behaviour require planning, suggesting instead that intentionality can manifest in the structured, reactive behaviours of model-free agents. By drawing on interdisciplinary insights from cognitive psychology, legal theory, and experimental jurisprudence, we explore the implications of this perspective for attributing responsibility and ensuring AI safety. These insights advocate for a broader, contextually informed interpretation of intentionality in RL systems, with implications for their ethical deployment and regulation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated optimization modeling (AOM) has evoked considerable interest with the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MedXpertQA: Benchmarking Expert-Level Medical Reasoning and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MedXpertQA, a highly challenging and comprehensive benchmark to evaluate expert-level medical knowledge and advanced reasoning. MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 16 leading models on MedXpertQA. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models.</description>

      <title>Gravity-Bench-v1: A Benchmark on Gravitational Physics Discovery for Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern science emerged from reasoning over repeatedly-observed planetary motions. We present Gravity-Bench-v1, an environment-based benchmark that challenges AI agents on tasks that parallel this historical development. Gravity-Bench-v1 evaluates agents on the discovery of physics concealed within a dynamic environment, using rigorous gravitational dynamics simulations. Gravity-Bench includes out-of-distribution cases, i.e. with physics that deviates from the real world, to evaluate true scientific generalization capabilities. Agents must plan to collect data within an experimental budget and must perform a dynamic form of data analysis and reasoning to solve tasks efficiently. Our benchmark admits an open-ended space of solutions. PhD-level solutions for each task are provided, to calibrate AI performance against human expertise. Technically at an upper-undergraduate level, our benchmark proves challenging to baseline AI agents. Gravity-Bench-v1 and planned extensions should help map out AI progress towards scientific discovery capabilities.</description>

      <title>GBFRS: Robust Fuzzy Rough Sets via Granular-ball Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy rough set theory is effective for processing datasets with complex attributes, supported by a solid mathematical foundation and closely linked to kernel methods in machine learning. Attribute reduction algorithms and classifiers based on fuzzy rough set theory exhibit promising performance in the analysis of high-dimensional multivariate complex data. However, most existing models operate at the finest granularity, rendering them inefficient and sensitive to noise, especially for high-dimensional big data. Thus, enhancing the robustness of fuzzy rough set models is crucial for effective feature selection. Muiti-garanularty granular-ball computing, a recent development, uses granular-balls of different sizes to adaptively represent and cover the sample space, performing learning based on these granular-balls. This paper proposes integrating multi-granularity granular-ball computing into fuzzy rough set theory, using granular-balls to replace sample points. The coarse-grained characteristics of granular-balls make the model more robust. Additionally, we propose a new method for generating granular-balls, scalable to the entire supervised method based on granular-ball computing. A forward search algorithm is used to select feature sequences by defining the correlation between features and categories through dependence functions. Experiments demonstrate the proposed model's effectiveness and superiority over baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Conversation Games and a Strategic View of the Turing Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although many game-theoretic models replicate real interactions that often rely on natural language, explicit study of games where language is central to strategic interaction remains limited. This paper introduces the \emph{conversation game}, a multi-stage, extensive-form game based on linguistic strategic interaction. We focus on a subset of the games, called verdict games. In a verdict game, two players alternate to contribute to a conversation, which is evaluated at each stage by a non-strategic judge who may render a conclusive binary verdict, or a decision to continue the dialogue. The game ends once a limit is reached or a verdict is given. We show many familiar processes, such as interrogation or a court process fall under this category. We also, show that the Turing test is an instance of verdict game, and discuss the significance of a strategic view of the Turing test in the age of advanced AI deception. We show the practical relevance of the proposed concepts by simulation experiments, and show that a strategic agent outperforms a naive agent by a high margin.</description>

      <title>Semantic Web and Creative AI -- A Technical Report from ISWS 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Semantic Web Research School (ISWS) is a week-long intensive program designed to immerse participants in the field. This document reports a collaborative effort performed by ten teams of students, each guided by a senior researcher as their mentor, attending ISWS 2023. Each team provided a different perspective to the topic of creative AI, substantiated by a set of research questions as the main subject of their investigation. The 2023 edition of ISWS focuses on the intersection of Semantic Web technologies and Creative AI. ISWS 2023 explored various intersections between Semantic Web technologies and creative AI. A key area of focus was the potential of LLMs as support tools for knowledge engineering. Participants also delved into the multifaceted applications of LLMs, including legal aspects of creative content production, humans in the loop, decentralised approaches to multimodal generative AI models, nanopublications and AI for personal scientific knowledge graphs, commonsense knowledge in automatic story and narrative completion, generative AI for art critique, prompt engineering, automatic music composition, commonsense prototyping and conceptual blending, and elicitation of tacit knowledge. As Large Language Models and semantic technologies continue to evolve, new exciting prospects are emerging: a future where the boundaries between creative expression and factual knowledge become increasingly permeable and porous, leading to a world of knowledge that is both informative and inspiring.</description>

      <title>Task and Perception-aware Distributed Source Coding for Correlated Speech under Bandwidth-constrained Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging wireless AR/VR applications require real-time transmission of correlated high-fidelity speech from multiple resource-constrained devices over unreliable, bandwidth-limited channels. Existing autoencoder-based speech source coding methods fail to address the combination of the following - (1) dynamic bitrate adaptation without retraining the model, (2) leveraging correlations among multiple speech sources, and (3) balancing downstream task loss with realism of reconstructed speech. We propose a neural distributed principal component analysis (NDPCA)-aided distributed source coding algorithm for correlated speech sources transmitting to a central receiver. Our method includes a perception-aware downstream task loss function that balances perceptual realism with task-specific performance. Experiments show significant PSNR improvements under bandwidth constraints over naive autoencoder methods in task-agnostic (19%) and task-aware settings (52%). It also approaches the theoretical upper bound, where all correlated sources are sent to a single encoder, especially in low-bandwidth scenarios. Additionally, we present a rate-distortion-perception trade-off curve, enabling adaptive decisions based on application-specific realism needs.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the January 2025 Los Angeles County wildfires: A multi-modal analysis of impact, response, and population exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of four significant California wildfires: Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth, and Hurst, examining their impacts through multiple dimensions, including land cover change, jurisdictional management, structural damage, and demographic vulnerability. Using the Chebyshev-Kolmogorov-Arnold network model applied to Sentinel-2 imagery, the extent of burned areas was mapped, ranging from 315.36 to 10,960.98 hectares. Our analysis revealed that shrubland ecosystems were consistently the most affected, comprising 57.4-75.8% of burned areas across all events. The jurisdictional assessment demonstrated varying management complexities, from singular authority (98.7% in the Palisades Fire) to distributed management across multiple agencies. A structural impact analysis revealed significant disparities between urban interface fires (Eaton: 9,869 structures; Palisades: 8,436 structures) and rural events (Kenneth: 24 structures; Hurst: 17 structures). The demographic analysis showed consistent gender distributions, with 50.9% of the population identified as female and 49.1% as male. Working-age populations made up the majority of the affected populations, ranging from 53.7% to 54.1%, with notable temporal shifts in post-fire periods. The study identified strong correlations between urban interface proximity, structural damage, and population exposure. The Palisades and Eaton fires affected over 20,000 people each, compared to fewer than 500 in rural events. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of targeted wildfire management strategies, particularly in wildland urban interface zones, and emphasize the need for age- and gender-conscious approaches in emergency response planning.</description>

      <title>RayLoc: Wireless Indoor Localization via Fully Differentiable Ray-tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless indoor localization has been a pivotal area of research over the last two decades, becoming a cornerstone for numerous sensing applications. However, conventional wireless localization methods rely on channel state information to perform blind modelling and estimation of a limited set of localization parameters. This oversimplification neglects many sensing scene details, resulting in suboptimal localization accuracy. To address this limitation, this paper presents a novel approach to wireless indoor localization by reformulating it as an inverse problem of wireless ray-tracing, inferring scene parameters that generates the measured CSI. At the core of our solution is a fully differentiable ray-tracing simulator that enables backpropagation to comprehensive parameters of the sensing scene, allowing for precise localization. To establish a robust localization context, RayLoc constructs a high-fidelity sensing scene by refining coarse-grained background model. Furthermore, RayLoc overcomes the challenges of sparse gradient and local minima by convolving the signal generation process with a Gaussian kernel. Extensive experiments showcase that RayLoc outperforms traditional localization baselines and is able to generalize to different sensing environments.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Robust Millimeter Wave Beam Alignment for AI-Native 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication has been recognized as a key pillar of 6G and beyond networks. In line with AI-native 6G vision, explainability and robustness in AI-driven systems are critical for establishing trust and ensuring reliable performance in diverse and evolving environments. This paper addresses these challenges by developing a robust and explainable deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment engine (BAE) for millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN)-based BAE utilizes received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements over a set of wide beams to accurately predict the best narrow beam for each UE, significantly reducing the overhead associated with exhaustive codebook-based narrow beam sweeping for initial access (IA) and data transmission. To ensure transparency and resilience, the Deep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN) algorithm is employed to assess the internal representations of the network via nearest neighbor approach, providing human-interpretable explanations and confidence metrics for detecting out-of-distribution inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DL-based BAE exhibits robustness to measurement noise, reduces beam training overhead by 75% compared to the exhaustive search while maintaining near-optimal performance in terms of spectral efficiency. Moreover, the proposed framework improves outlier detection robustness by up to 5x and offers clearer insights into beam prediction decisions compared to traditional softmax-based classifiers.</description>

      <title>RadioLLM: Introducing Large Language Model into Cognitive Radio via Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogrammings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing scarcity of spectrum resources and the rapid growth of wireless device have made efficient management of radio networks a critical challenge. Cognitive Radio Technology (CRT), when integrated with deep learning (DL), offers promising solutions for tasks such as radio signal classification (RSC), signal denoising, and spectrum allocation. However, existing DL-based CRT frameworks are often task-specific and lack scalability to diverse real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities across multiple domains, making them a potential candidate for advancing CRT technologies. In this paper, we introduce RadioLLM, a novel framework that incorporates Hybrid Prompt and Token Reprogramming (HPTR) and a Frequency Attuned Fusion (FAF) module to enhance LLMs for CRT tasks. HPTR enables the integration of radio signal features with expert knowledge, while FAF improves the modeling of high-frequency features critical for precise signal processing. These innovations allow RadioLLM to handle diverse CRT tasks, bridging the gap between LLMs and traditional signal processing methods. Extensive empirical studies on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed RadioLLM achieves superior performance over current baselines.</description>

      <title>Knoop: Practical Enhancement of Knockoff with Over-Parameterization for Variable Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable selection plays a crucial role in enhancing modeling effectiveness across diverse fields, addressing the challenges posed by high-dimensional datasets of correlated variables. This work introduces a novel approach namely Knockoff with over-parameterization (Knoop) to enhance Knockoff filters for variable selection. Specifically, Knoop first generates multiple knockoff variables for each original variable and integrates them with the original variables into an over-parameterized Ridgeless regression model. For each original variable, Knoop evaluates the coefficient distribution of its knockoffs and compares these with the original coefficients to conduct an anomaly-based significance test, ensuring robust variable selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in both simulation and real-world datasets. Knoop achieves a notably higher Area under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve for effectively identifying relevant variables against the ground truth by controlled simulations, while showcasing enhanced predictive accuracy across diverse regression and classification tasks. The analytical results further backup our observations.</description>

      <title>Progress in Artificial Intelligence and its Determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study long-run progress in artificial intelligence in a quantitative way. Many measures, including traditional ones such as patents and publications, machine learning benchmarks, and a new Aggregate State of the Art in ML (or ASOTA) Index we have constructed from these, show exponential growth at roughly constant rates over long periods. Production of patents and publications doubles every ten years, by contrast with the growth of computing resources driven by Moore's Law, roughly a doubling every two years. We argue that the input of AI researchers is also crucial and its contribution can be objectively estimated. Consequently, we give a simple argument that explains the 5:1 relation between these two rates. We then discuss the application of this argument to different output measures and compare our analyses with predictions based on machine learning scaling laws proposed in existing literature. Our quantitative framework facilitates understanding, predicting, and modulating the development of these important technologies.</description>

      <title>The Right to AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Right to AI, which asserts that individuals and communities should meaningfully participate in the development and governance of the AI systems that shape their lives. Motivated by the increasing deployment of AI in critical domains and inspired by Henri Lefebvre's concept of the Right to the City, we reconceptualize AI as a societal infrastructure, rather than merely a product of expert design. In this paper, we critically evaluate how generative agents, large-scale data extraction, and diverse cultural values bring new complexities to AI oversight. The paper proposes that grassroots participatory methodologies can mitigate biased outcomes and enhance social responsiveness. It asserts that data is socially produced and should be managed and owned collectively. Drawing on Sherry Arnstein's Ladder of Citizen Participation and analyzing nine case studies, the paper develops a four-tier model for the Right to AI that situates the current paradigm and envisions an aspirational future. It proposes recommendations for inclusive data ownership, transparent design processes, and stakeholder-driven oversight. We also discuss market-led and state-centric alternatives and argue that participatory approaches offer a better balance between technical efficiency and democratic legitimacy.</description>

      <title>Free Agent in Agent-Based Mixture-of-Experts Generative AI Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems commonly distribute tasks among specialized, autonomous agents, yet they often lack mechanisms to replace or reassign underperforming agents in real time. Inspired by the free-agency model of Major League Baseball, the Reinforcement Learning Free Agent (RLFA) algorithm introduces a reward-based mechanism to detect and remove agents exhibiting persistent underperformance and seamlessly insert more capable ones. Each agent internally uses a mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach, delegating incoming tasks to specialized sub-models under the guidance of a gating function. A primary use case is fraud detection, where RLFA promptly swaps out an agent whose detection accuracy dips below a preset threshold. A new agent is tested in a probationary mode, and upon demonstrating superior performance, fully replaces the underperformer. This dynamic, free-agency cycle ensures sustained accuracy, quicker adaptation to emerging threats, and minimal disruption to ongoing operations. By continually refreshing its roster of agents, the system fosters ongoing improvements and more resilient collaboration in multi-agent Generative AI environments.</description>

      <title>DReSS: Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress across various domains, but their increasing scale results in high computational and memory costs. Recent studies have revealed that LLMs exhibit sparsity, providing the potential to reduce model size through pruning techniques. However, existing pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned components still contain valuable information, their direct removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation, imposing a substantial computational burden to recover performance during finetuning. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that first applies regularization, then prunes, and finally finetunes. Based on this paradigm, we introduce DReSS, a simple and effective Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining method for LLMs. By leveraging a small amount of data to regularize the components to be pruned, DReSS explicitly transfers the important information to the remaining parts of the model in advance. Compared to direct pruning, this can reduce the information loss caused by parameter removal, thereby enhancing its language modeling capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DReSS significantly outperforms existing pruning methods even under extreme pruning ratios, significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput.</description>

      <title>Deep Ensembles Secretly Perform Empirical Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural networks is a highly relevant problem which is essential to many applications. The two predominant paradigms to tackle this task are Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles. Despite some similarities between these two approaches, they are typically surmised to lack a formal connection and are thus understood as fundamentally different. BNNs are often touted as more principled due to their reliance on the Bayesian paradigm, whereas ensembles are perceived as more ad-hoc; yet, deep ensembles tend to empirically outperform BNNs, with no satisfying explanation as to why this is the case. In this work we bridge this gap by showing that deep ensembles perform exact Bayesian averaging with a posterior obtained with an implicitly learned data-dependent prior. In other words deep ensembles are Bayesian, or more specifically, they implement an empirical Bayes procedure wherein the prior is learned from the data. This perspective offers two main benefits: (i) it theoretically justifies deep ensembles and thus provides an explanation for their strong empirical performance; and (ii) inspection of the learned prior reveals it is given by a mixture of point masses -- the use of such a strong prior helps elucidate observed phenomena about ensembles. Overall, our work delivers a newfound understanding of deep ensembles which is not only of interest in it of itself, but which is also likely to generate future insights that drive empirical improvements for these models.</description>

      <title>Limits to AI Growth: The Ecological and Social Consequences of Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerating development and deployment of AI technologies depend on the continued ability to scale their infrastructure. This has implied increasing amounts of monetary investment and natural resources. Frontier AI applications have thus resulted in rising financial, environmental, and social costs. While the factors that AI scaling depends on reach its limits, the push for its accelerated advancement and entrenchment continues. In this paper, we provide a holistic review of AI scaling using four lenses (technical, economic, ecological, and social) and review the relationships between these lenses to explore the dynamics of AI growth. We do so by drawing on system dynamics concepts including archetypes such as "limits to growth" to model the dynamic complexity of AI scaling and synthesize several perspectives. Our work maps out the entangled relationships between the technical, economic, ecological and social perspectives and the apparent limits to growth. The analysis explains how industry's responses to external limits enables continued (but temporary) scaling and how this benefits Big Tech while externalizing social and environmental damages. To avoid an "overshoot and collapse" trajectory, we advocate for realigning priorities and norms around scaling to prioritize sustainable and mindful advancements.</description>

      <title>Belief Roadmaps with Uncertain Landmark Evanescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We would like a robot to navigate to a goal location while minimizing state uncertainty. To aid the robot in this endeavor, maps provide a prior belief over the location of objects and regions of interest. To localize itself within the map, a robot identifies mapped landmarks using its sensors. However, as the time between map creation and robot deployment increases, portions of the map can become stale, and landmarks, once believed to be permanent, may disappear. We refer to the propensity of a landmark to disappear as landmark evanescence. Reasoning about landmark evanescence during path planning, and the associated impact on localization accuracy, requires analyzing the presence or absence of each landmark, leading to an exponential number of possible outcomes of a given motion plan. To address this complexity, we develop BRULE, an extension of the Belief Roadmap. During planning, we replace the belief over future robot poses with a Gaussian mixture which is able to capture the effects of landmark evanescence. Furthermore, we show that belief updates can be made efficient, and that maintaining a random subset of mixture components is sufficient to find high quality solutions. We demonstrate performance in simulated and real-world experiments. Software is available at https://bit.ly/BRULE.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of Adversaries in Multimodal Alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Machine Learning systems, particularly those aligning text and image data like CLIP/BLIP models, have become increasingly prevalent, yet remain susceptible to adversarial attacks. While substantial research has addressed adversarial robustness in unimodal contexts, defense strategies for multimodal systems are underexplored. This work investigates the topological signatures that arise between image and text embeddings and shows how adversarial attacks disrupt their alignment, introducing distinctive signatures. We specifically leverage persistent homology and introduce two novel Topological-Contrastive losses based on Total Persistence and Multi-scale kernel methods to analyze the topological signatures introduced by adversarial perturbations. We observe a pattern of monotonic changes in the proposed topological losses emerging in a wide range of attacks on image-text alignments, as more adversarial samples are introduced in the data. By designing an algorithm to back-propagate these signatures to input samples, we are able to integrate these signatures into Maximum Mean Discrepancy tests, creating a novel class of tests that leverage topological signatures for better adversarial detection.</description>

      <title>Anatomy Might Be All You Need: Forecasting What to Do During Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical guidance can be delivered in various ways. In neurosurgery, spatial guidance and orientation are predominantly achieved through neuronavigation systems that reference pre-operative MRI scans. Recently, there has been growing interest in providing live guidance by analyzing video feeds from tools such as endoscopes. Existing approaches, including anatomy detection, orientation feedback, phase recognition, and visual question-answering, primarily focus on aiding surgeons in assessing the current surgical scene. This work aims to provide guidance on a finer scale, aiming to provide guidance by forecasting the trajectory of the surgical instrument, essentially addressing the question of what to do next. To address this task, we propose a model that not only leverages the historical locations of surgical instruments but also integrates anatomical features. Importantly, our work does not rely on explicit ground truth labels for instrument trajectories. Instead, the ground truth is generated by a detection model trained to detect both anatomical structures and instruments within surgical videos of a comprehensive dataset containing pituitary surgery videos. By analyzing the interaction between anatomy and instrument movements in these videos and forecasting future instrument movements, we show that anatomical features are a valuable asset in addressing this challenging task. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to address this task for manually operated surgeries.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Enabled Real-Time Control in Robotic Additive Manufacturing via Soft Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart manufacturing systems increasingly rely on adaptive control mechanisms to optimize complex processes. This research presents a novel approach integrating Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning with digital twin technology to enable real-time process control in robotic additive manufacturing. We demonstrate our methodology using a Viper X300s robot arm, implementing two distinct control scenarios: static target acquisition and dynamic trajectory following. The system architecture combines Unity's simulation environment with ROS2 for seamless digital twin synchronization, while leveraging transfer learning to efficiently adapt trained models across tasks. Our hierarchical reward structure addresses common reinforcement learning challenges including local minima avoidance, convergence acceleration, and training stability. Experimental results show rapid policy convergence and robust task execution in both simulated and physical environments, with performance metrics including cumulative reward, value prediction accuracy, policy loss, and discrete entropy coefficient demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This work advances the integration of reinforcement learning with digital twins for industrial robotics applications, providing a framework for enhanced adaptive real-time control for smart additive manufacturing process.</description>

      <title>From tools to thieves: Measuring and understanding public perceptions of AI through crowdsourced metaphors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How has the public responded to the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies? We investigate public perceptions of AI by collecting over 12,000 responses over 12 months from a nationally representative U.S. sample. Participants provided open-ended metaphors reflecting their mental models of AI, a methodology that overcomes the limitations of traditional self-reported measures. Using a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative clustering and qualitative coding, we identify 20 dominant metaphors shaping public understanding of AI. To analyze these metaphors systematically, we present a scalable framework integrating language modeling (LM)-based techniques to measure key dimensions of public perception: anthropomorphism (attribution of human-like qualities), warmth, and competence. We find that Americans generally view AI as warm and competent, and that over the past year, perceptions of AI's human-likeness and warmth have significantly increased ($+34\%, r = 0.80, p &lt; 0.01; +41\%, r = 0.62, p &lt; 0.05$). Furthermore, these implicit perceptions, along with the identified dominant metaphors, strongly predict trust in and willingness to adopt AI ($r^2 = 0.21, 0.18, p &lt; 0.001$). We further explore how differences in metaphors and implicit perceptions--such as the higher propensity of women, older individuals, and people of color to anthropomorphize AI--shed light on demographic disparities in trust and adoption. In addition to our dataset and framework for tracking evolving public attitudes, we provide actionable insights on using metaphors for inclusive and responsible AI development.</description>

      <title>SAeUron: Interpretable Concept Unlearning in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent machine unlearning approaches offer promising solution for removing unwanted concepts from diffusion models. However, traditional methods, which largely rely on fine-tuning, provide little insight into the changes they introduce to the base model, making it unclear whether concepts are truly removed or only masked. In this work, we introduce SAeUron, a novel method leveraging features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to unlearn unwanted concepts in text-to-image diffusion models. First, we demonstrate that SAEs, trained in an unsupervised manner on activations from multiple denoising timesteps of the diffusion model, capture sparse and interpretable features corresponding to specific concepts. Building on this, we propose a method of selecting concept-specific features. This enables precise interventions on the model's activations to block targeted content while preserving the model's overall performance. Evaluation on the competitive UnlearnCanvas benchmark on object and style unlearning highlights SAeUron's state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we show that with a single SAE, we can remove multiple concepts simultaneously and that in contrast to other methods, SAeUron dismisses the possibility of generating unwanted content, even under adversarial attack.</description>

      <title>Current Pathology Foundation Models are unrobust to Medical Center Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathology Foundation Models (FMs) hold great promise for healthcare. Before they can be used in clinical practice, it is essential to ensure they are robust to variations between medical centers. We measure whether pathology FMs focus on biological features like tissue and cancer type, or on the well known confounding medical center signatures introduced by staining procedure and other differences. We introduce the Robustness Index. This novel robustness metric reflects to what degree biological features dominate confounding features. Ten current publicly available pathology FMs are evaluated. We find that all current pathology foundation models evaluated represent the medical center to a strong degree. Significant differences in the robustness index are observed. Only one model so far has a robustness index greater than one, meaning biological features dominate confounding features, but only slightly. A quantitative approach to measure the influence of medical center differences on FM-based prediction performance is described. We analyze the impact of unrobustness on classification performance of downstream models, and find that cancer-type classification errors are not random, but specifically attributable to same-center confounders: images of other classes from the same medical center. We visualize FM embedding spaces, and find these are more strongly organized by medical centers than by biological factors. As a consequence, the medical center of origin is predicted more accurately than the tissue source and cancer type. The robustness index introduced here is provided with the aim of advancing progress towards clinical adoption of robust and reliable pathology FMs.</description>

      <title>Learning the Optimal Stopping for Early Classification within Finite Horizons via Sequential Probability Ratio Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-sensitive machine learning benefits from Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT), which provides an optimal stopping time for early classification of time series. However, in finite horizon scenarios, where input lengths are finite, determining the optimal stopping rule becomes computationally intensive due to the need for backward induction, limiting practical applicability. We thus introduce FIRMBOUND, an SPRT-based framework that efficiently estimates the solution to backward induction from training data, bridging the gap between optimal stopping theory and real-world deployment. It employs density ratio estimation and convex function learning to provide statistically consistent estimators for sufficient statistic and conditional expectation, both essential for solving backward induction; consequently, FIRMBOUND minimizes Bayes risk to reach optimality. Additionally, we present a faster alternative using Gaussian process regression, which significantly reduces training time while retaining low deployment overhead, albeit with potential compromise in statistical consistency. Experiments across independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), non-i.i.d., binary, multiclass, synthetic, and real-world datasets show that FIRMBOUND achieves optimalities in the sense of Bayes risk and speed-accuracy tradeoff. Furthermore, it advances the tradeoff boundary toward optimality when possible and reduces decision-time variance, ensuring reliable decision-making.

      <title>Learning Metal Microstructural Heterogeneity through Spatial Mapping of Diffraction Latent Space Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To leverage advancements in machine learning for metallic materials design and property prediction, it is crucial to develop a data-reduced representation of metal microstructures that surpasses the limitations of current physics-based discrete microstructure descriptors. This need is particularly relevant for metallic materials processed through additive manufacturing, which exhibit complex hierarchical microstructures that cannot be adequately described using the conventional metrics typically applied to wrought materials. Furthermore, capturing the spatial heterogeneity of microstructures at the different scales is necessary within such framework to accurately predict their properties. To address these challenges, we propose the physical spatial mapping of metal diffraction latent space features. This approach integrates (i) point diffraction data encoding via variational autoencoders or contrastive learning and (ii) the physical mapping of the encoded values. Together these steps offer a method offers a novel means to comprehensively describe metal microstructures. We demonstrate this approach on a wrought and additively manufactured alloy, showing that it effectively encodes microstructural information and enables direct identification of microstructural heterogeneity not directly possible by physics-based models. This data-reduced microstructure representation opens the application of machine learning models in accelerating metallic material design and accurately predicting their properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health issue of significance that must be diagnosed as early as possible and managed well. This study presents a framework for diabetes prediction using Machine Learning (ML) models, complemented with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools, to investigate both the predictive accuracy and interpretability of the predictions from ML models. Data Preprocessing is based on the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and feature scaling used on the Diabetes Binary Health Indicators dataset to deal with class imbalance and variability of clinical features. The ensemble model provided high accuracy, with a test accuracy of 92.50% and an ROC-AUC of 0.975. BMI, Age, General Health, Income, and Physical Activity were the most influential predictors obtained from the model explanations. The results of this study suggest that ML combined with XAI is a promising means of developing accurate and computationally transparent tools for use in healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>DIAL: Distribution-Informed Adaptive Learning of Multi-Task Constraints for Safety-Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning has traditionally relied on predefined constraint functions to ensure safety in complex real-world tasks, such as autonomous driving. However, defining these functions accurately for varied tasks is a persistent challenge. Recent research highlights the potential of leveraging pre-acquired task-agnostic knowledge to enhance both safety and sample efficiency in related tasks. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to learn shared constraint distributions across multiple tasks. Our approach identifies the shared constraints through imitation learning and then adapts to new tasks by adjusting risk levels within these learned distributions. This adaptability addresses variations in risk sensitivity stemming from expert-specific biases, ensuring consistent adherence to general safety principles even with imperfect demonstrations. Our method can be applied to control and navigation domains, including multi-task and meta-task scenarios, accommodating constraints such as maintaining safe distances or adhering to speed limits. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating superior safety performance and success rates compared to baselines, all without requiring task-specific constraint definitions. These findings underscore the versatility and practicality of our method across a wide range of real-world tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MILS: Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver, a surprisingly simple, training-free approach, to imbue multimodal capabilities into your favorite LLM. Leveraging their innate ability to perform multi-step reasoning, MILS prompts the LLM to generate candidate outputs, each of which are scored and fed back iteratively, eventually generating a solution to the task. This enables various applications that typically require training specialized models on task-specific data. In particular, we establish a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot image, video and audio captioning. MILS seamlessly applies to media generation as well, discovering prompt rewrites to improve text-to-image generation, and even edit prompts for style transfer! Finally, being a gradient-free optimization approach, MILS can invert multimodal embeddings into text, enabling applications like cross-modal arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Panacea: Mitigating Harmful Fine-tuning for Large Language Models via Post-fine-tuning Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning attack introduces significant security risks to the fine-tuning services. Mainstream defenses aim to vaccinate the model such that the later harmful fine-tuning attack is less effective. However, our evaluation results show that such defenses are fragile -- with a few fine-tuning steps, the model still can learn the harmful knowledge. To this end, we do further experiment and find that an embarrassingly simple solution -- adding purely random perturbations to the fine-tuned model, can recover the model from harmful behavior, though it leads to a degradation in the model's fine-tuning performance. To address the degradation of fine-tuning performance, we further propose Panacea, which optimizes an adaptive perturbation that will be applied to the model after fine-tuning. Panacea maintains model's safety alignment performance without compromising downstream fine-tuning performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on different harmful ratios, fine-tuning tasks and mainstream LLMs, where the average harmful scores are reduced by up-to 21.5%, while maintaining fine-tuning performance. As a by-product, we analyze the optimized perturbation and show that different layers in various LLMs have distinct safety coefficients.

      <title>Scaling Inference-Efficient Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws are powerful tools to predict the performance of large language models. However, current scaling laws fall short of accounting for inference costs. In this work, we first show that model architecture affects inference latency, where models of the same size can have up to 3.5x difference in latency. To tackle this challenge, we modify the Chinchilla scaling laws to co-optimize the model parameter count, the number of training tokens, and the model architecture. Due to the reason that models of similar training loss exhibit gaps in downstream evaluation, we also propose a novel method to train inference-efficient models based on the revised scaling laws. We perform extensive empirical studies to fit and evaluate our inference-aware scaling laws. We vary model parameters from 80M to 1B, training tokens from 1.6B to 30B, and model shapes, training a total of 63 models. Guided by our inference-efficient scaling law and model selection method, we release the Morph-1B model, which improves inference latency by 1.8x while maintaining accuracy on downstream tasks compared to open-source models, pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy-latency tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Investigating an Intelligent System to Monitor \&amp; Explain Abnormal Activity Patterns of Older Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing potential of older adult care technologies, the adoption of these technologies remains challenging. In this work, we conducted a focus-group session with family caregivers to scope designs of the older adult care technology. We then developed a high-fidelity prototype and conducted its qualitative study with professional caregivers and older adults to understand their perspectives on the system functionalities. This system monitors abnormal activity patterns of older adults using wireless motion sensors and machine learning models and supports interactive dialogue responses to explain abnormal activity patterns of older adults to caregivers and allow older adults proactively sharing their status with caregivers for an adequate intervention. Both older adults and professional caregivers appreciated that our system can provide a faster, personalized service while proactively controlling what information is to be shared through interactive dialogue responses. We further discuss other considerations to realize older adult technology in practice.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Quantized Representation for Seamlessly Integrating Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the presence of the natural gap between Knowledge Graph (KG) structures and the natural language, the effective integration of holistic structural information of KGs with Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a significant question. To this end, we propose a two-stage framework to learn and apply quantized codes for each entity, aiming for the seamless integration of KGs with LLMs. Firstly, a self-supervised quantized representation (SSQR) method is proposed to compress both KG structural and semantic knowledge into discrete codes (\ie, tokens) that align the format of language sentences. We further design KG instruction-following data by viewing these learned codes as features to directly input to LLMs, thereby achieving seamless integration. The experiment results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised quantized methods, producing more distinguishable codes. Further, the fine-tuned LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 also have superior performance on KG link prediction and triple classification tasks, utilizing only 16 tokens per entity instead of thousands in conventional prompting methods.</description>

      <title>VQLTI: Long-Term Tropical Cyclone Intensity Forecasting with Physical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical cyclone (TC) intensity forecasting is crucial for early disaster warning and emergency decision-making. Numerous researchers have explored deep-learning methods to address computational and post-processing issues in operational forecasting. Regrettably, they exhibit subpar long-term forecasting capabilities. We use two strategies to enhance long-term forecasting. (1) By enhancing the matching between TC intensity and spatial information, we can improve long-term forecasting performance. (2) Incorporating physical knowledge and physical constraints can help mitigate the accumulation of forecasting errors. To achieve the above strategies, we propose the VQLTI framework. VQLTI transfers the TC intensity information to a discrete latent space while retaining the spatial information differences, using large-scale spatial meteorological data as conditions. Furthermore, we leverage the forecast from the weather prediction model FengWu to provide additional physical knowledge for VQLTI. Additionally, we calculate the potential intensity (PI) to impose physical constraints on the latent variables. In the global long-term TC intensity forecasting, VQLTI achieves state-of-the-art results for the 24h to 120h, with the MSW (Maximum Sustained Wind) forecast error reduced by 35.65%-42.51% compared to ECMWF-IFS.</description>

      <title>REMOTE: Real-time Ego-motion Tracking for Various Endoscopes via Multimodal Visual Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope is a significant task for efficient navigation and robotic automation of endoscopy. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to perform real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope. Firstly, a multi-modal visual feature learning network is proposed to perform relative pose prediction, in which the motion feature from the optical flow, the scene features and the joint feature from two adjacent observations are all extracted for prediction. Due to more correlation information in the channel dimension of the concatenated image, a novel feature extractor is designed based on an attention mechanism to integrate multi-dimensional information from the concatenation of two continuous frames. To extract more complete feature representation from the fused features, a novel pose decoder is proposed to predict the pose transformation from the concatenated feature map at the end of the framework. At last, the absolute pose of endoscope is calculated based on relative poses. The experiment is conducted on three datasets of various endoscopic scenes and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the inference speed of the proposed method is over 30 frames per second, which meets the real-time requirement.

      <title>Unraveling the Capabilities of Language Models in News Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the recent introduction of multiple language models and the ongoing demand for improved Natural Language Processing tasks, particularly summarization, this work provides a comprehensive benchmarking of 20 recent language models, focusing on smaller ones for the news summarization task. In this work, we systematically test the capabilities and effectiveness of these models in summarizing news article texts which are written in different styles and presented in three distinct datasets. Specifically, we focus in this study on zero-shot and few-shot learning settings and we apply a robust evaluation methodology that combines different evaluation concepts including automatic metrics, human evaluation, and LLM-as-a-judge. Interestingly, including demonstration examples in the few-shot learning setting did not enhance models' performance and, in some cases, even led to worse quality of the generated summaries. This issue arises mainly due to the poor quality of the gold summaries that have been used as reference summaries, which negatively impacts the models' performance. Furthermore, our study's results highlight the exceptional performance of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, which generally dominate due to their advanced capabilities. However, among the public models evaluated, certain models such as Qwen1.5-7B, SOLAR-10.7B-Instruct-v1.0, Meta-Llama-3-8B and Zephyr-7B-Beta demonstrated promising results. These models showed significant potential, positioning them as competitive alternatives to large models for the task of news summarization.</description>

      <title>Revisiting gender bias research in bibliometrics: Standardizing methodological variability using Scholarly Data Analysis (SoDA) Cards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gender biases in scholarly metrics remain a persistent concern, despite numerous bibliometric studies exploring their presence and absence across productivity, impact, acknowledgment, and self-citations. However, methodological inconsistencies, particularly in author name disambiguation and gender identification, limit the reliability and comparability of these studies, potentially perpetuating misperceptions and hindering effective interventions. A review of 70 relevant publications over the past 12 years reveals a wide range of approaches, from name-based and manual searches to more algorithmic and gold-standard methods, with no clear consensus on best practices. This variability, compounded by challenges such as accurately disambiguating Asian names and managing unassigned gender labels, underscores the urgent need for standardized and robust methodologies. To address this critical gap, we propose the development and implementation of ``Scholarly Data Analysis (SoDA) Cards." These cards will provide a structured framework for documenting and reporting key methodological choices in scholarly data analysis, including author name disambiguation and gender identification procedures. By promoting transparency and reproducibility, SoDA Cards will facilitate more accurate comparisons and aggregations of research findings, ultimately supporting evidence-informed policymaking and enabling the longitudinal tracking of analytical approaches in the study of gender and other social biases in academia.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Synchronized Neural Hashing for Unsupervised Ransomware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy-based detection methodologies have gained significant attention due to their ability to analyze structural irregularities within executable files, particularly in the identification of malicious software employing advanced obfuscation techniques. The Entropy-Synchronized Neural Hashing (ESNH) framework introduces a novel approach that leverages entropy-driven hash representations to classify software binaries based on their underlying entropy characteristics. Through the synchronization of entropy profiles with neural network architectures, the model generates robust and unique hash values that maintain stability even when faced with polymorphic and metamorphic transformations. Comparative analysis against traditional detection approaches revealed superior performance in identifying novel threats, reducing false-positive rates, and achieving consistent classification across diverse ransomware families. The incorporation of a self-regulating hash convergence mechanism further ensured that entropy-synchronized hashes remained invariant across executions, minimizing classification inconsistencies that often arise due to dynamic modifications in ransomware payloads. Experimental results demonstrated high detection rates across contemporary ransomware strains, with the model exhibiting resilience against encryption-based evasion mechanisms, code injection strategies, and reflective loading techniques. Unlike conventional detection mechanisms that rely on static signatures and heuristic analysis, the proposed entropy-aware classification framework adapts to emerging threats through an inherent ability to capture entropy anomalies within executable structures. The findings reinforce the potential of entropy-based detection in addressing the limitations of traditional methodologies while enhancing detection robustness against obfuscation and adversarial evasion techniques.</description>

      <title>Tensor Completion for Surrogate Modeling of Material Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When designing materials to optimize certain properties, there are often many possible configurations of designs that need to be explored. For example, the materials' composition of elements will affect properties such as strength or conductivity, which are necessary to know when developing new materials. Exploring all combinations of elements to find optimal materials becomes very time consuming, especially when there are more design variables. For this reason, there is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict a material's properties. In this work, we model the optimization of certain material properties as a tensor completion problem, to leverage the structure of our datasets and navigate the vast number of combinations of material configurations. Across a variety of material property prediction tasks, our experiments show tensor completion methods achieving 10-20% decreased error compared with baseline ML models such as GradientBoosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), while maintaining similar training speed.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning of Polynomial Kernel Regression in Transformers with GLU Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable ability in in-context learning (ICL), where they can adapt to unseen tasks from a prompt with a few examples, without requiring parameter updates. Recent research has provided insight into how linear Transformers can perform ICL by implementing gradient descent estimators. In particular, it has been shown that the optimal linear self-attention (LSA) mechanism can implement one step of gradient descent with respect to a linear least-squares objective when trained on random linear regression tasks.
  However, the theoretical understanding of ICL for nonlinear function classes remains limited. In this work, we address this gap by first showing that LSA is inherently restricted to solving linear least-squares objectives and thus, the solutions in prior works cannot readily extend to nonlinear ICL tasks. To overcome this limitation, drawing inspiration from modern architectures, we study a mechanism that combines LSA with GLU-like feed-forward layers and show that this allows the model to perform one step of gradient descent on a polynomial kernel regression. Further, we characterize the scaling behavior of the resulting Transformer model, highlighting the necessary model size to effectively handle quadratic ICL tasks. Our findings highlight the distinct roles of attention and feed-forward layers in nonlinear ICL and identify key challenges when extending ICL to nonlinear function classes.</description>

      <title>HKAN: Hierarchical Kolmogorov-Arnold Network without Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Hierarchical Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (HKAN), a novel network architecture that offers a competitive alternative to the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Unlike KAN, which relies on backpropagation, HKAN adopts a randomized learning approach, where the parameters of its basis functions are fixed, and linear aggregations are optimized using least-squares regression. HKAN utilizes a hierarchical multi-stacking framework, with each layer refining the predictions from the previous one by solving a series of linear regression problems. This non-iterative training method simplifies computation and eliminates sensitivity to local minima in the loss function. Empirical results show that HKAN delivers comparable, if not superior, accuracy and stability relative to KAN across various regression tasks, while also providing insights into variable importance. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates theoretical insights with practical applications, presenting a robust and efficient alternative for neural network modeling.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we expand upon the FLIP benchmark-designed for evaluating protein fitness prediction models in small, specialized prediction tasks-by assessing the performance of state-of-the-art large protein language models, including ESM-2 and SaProt on the FLIP dataset. Unlike larger, more diverse benchmarks such as ProteinGym, which cover a broad spectrum of tasks, FLIP focuses on constrained settings where data availability is limited. This makes it an ideal framework to evaluate model performance in scenarios with scarce task-specific data. We investigate whether recent advances in protein language models lead to significant improvements in such settings. Our findings provide valuable insights into the performance of large-scale models in specialized protein prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Data as Images: Fusion of Patient Data Across Modalities and Irregular Intervals with Vision Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A patient undergoes multiple examinations in each hospital stay, where each provides different facets of the health status. These assessments include temporal data with varying sampling rates, discrete single-point measurements, therapeutic interventions such as medication administration, and images. While physicians are able to process and integrate diverse modalities intuitively, neural networks need specific modeling for each modality complicating the training procedure. We demonstrate that this complexity can be significantly reduced by visualizing all information as images along with unstructured text and subsequently training a conventional vision-text transformer. Our approach, Vision Transformer for irregular sampled Multi-modal Measurements (ViTiMM), not only simplifies data preprocessing and modeling but also outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in predicting in-hospital mortality and phenotyping, as evaluated on 6,175 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The modalities include patient's clinical measurements, medications, X-ray images, and electrocardiography scans. We hope our work inspires advancements in multi-modal medical AI by reducing the training complexity to (visual) prompt engineering, thus lowering entry barriers and enabling no-code solutions for training. The source code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>PDE-DKL: PDE-constrained deep kernel learning in high dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many physics-informed machine learning methods for PDE-based problems rely on Gaussian processes (GPs) or neural networks (NNs). However, both face limitations when data are scarce and the dimensionality is high. Although GPs are known for their robust uncertainty quantification in low-dimensional settings, their computational complexity becomes prohibitive as the dimensionality increases. In contrast, while conventional NNs can accommodate high-dimensional input, they often require extensive training data and do not offer uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a PDE-constrained Deep Kernel Learning (PDE-DKL) framework that combines DL and GPs under explicit PDE constraints. Specifically, NNs learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the high-dimensional PDE problem, reducing the complexity of the problem. GPs then perform kernel regression subject to the governing PDEs, ensuring accurate solutions and principled uncertainty quantification, even when available data are limited. This synergy unifies the strengths of both NNs and GPs, yielding high accuracy, robust uncertainty estimates, and computational efficiency for high-dimensional PDEs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that PDE-DKL achieves high accuracy with reduced data requirements. They highlight its potential as a practical, reliable, and scalable solver for complex PDE-based applications in science and engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal transformers are rapidly gaining attention in video captioning tasks. Existing multi-modal video captioning methods typically extract a fixed number of frames, which raises critical challenges. When a limited number of frames are extracted, important frames with essential information for caption generation may be missed. Conversely, extracting an excessive number of frames includes consecutive frames, potentially causing redundancy in visual tokens extracted from consecutive video frames. To extract an appropriate number of frames for each video, this paper proposes the first model-agnostic module selection framework in video captioning that has two main functions: (1) selecting a caption generation module with an appropriate size based on visual tokens extracted from video frames, and (2) constructing subsets of visual tokens for the selected caption generation module. Furthermore, we propose a new adaptive attention masking scheme that enhances attention on important visual tokens. Our experiments on three different benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the performance of three recent video captioning models.</description>

      <title>The iToBoS dataset: skin region images extracted from 3D total body photographs for lesion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has significantly advanced skin cancer diagnosis by enabling rapid and accurate detection of malignant lesions. In this domain, most publicly available image datasets consist of single, isolated skin lesions positioned at the center of the image. While these lesion-centric datasets have been fundamental for developing diagnostic algorithms, they lack the context of the surrounding skin, which is critical for improving lesion detection. The iToBoS dataset was created to address this challenge. It includes 16,954 images of skin regions from 100 participants, captured using 3D total body photography. Each image roughly corresponds to a $7 \times 9$ cm section of skin with all suspicious lesions annotated using bounding boxes. Additionally, the dataset provides metadata such as anatomical location, age group, and sun damage score for each image. This dataset aims to facilitate training and benchmarking of algorithms, with the goal of enabling early detection of skin cancer and deployment of this technology in non-clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Pre-Trained Vision-Language Model Selection and Reuse for Downstream Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular across various visual tasks, and several open-sourced VLM variants have been released. However, selecting the best-performing pre-trained VLM for a specific downstream task is challenging since no single VLM can achieve promising performance on all downstream tasks, and evaluating all available VLMs is impossible due to time and data limitations. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel paradigm to select and reuse VLM for downstream tasks, called Model Label Learning (MLL). The proposal contains three key modules: \emph{model labeling}, which assigns labels to each VLM to describe their specialty and utility; \emph{model selection}, which matches the requirements of the target task with model labels; and \emph{model reuse}, which applies selected VLMs to the target task in an ensemble manner. The proposal is highly computationally efficient and growable since the model labeling process is completed target task independent and the ability could grow with the number of candidate VLMs. We also introduce a new benchmark for evaluating VLM selection methods, including 49 VLMs and 17 target task datasets. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for selecting and reusing VLMs.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking LLMs' Safeguard with Universal Magic Words for Text Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The security issue of large language models (LLMs) has gained significant attention recently, with various defense mechanisms developed to prevent harmful outputs, among which safeguards based on text embedding models serve as a fundamental defense. Through testing, we discover that the distribution of text embedding model outputs is significantly biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel efficient methods to search for universal magic words that can attack text embedding models. The universal magic words as suffixes can move the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, therefore manipulate the similarity of any text pair and mislead safeguards. By appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words, attackers can jailbreak the safeguard. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense mechanisms against such attacks, which can correct the biased distribution of text embeddings in a train-free manner.</description>

      <title>Mining for Species, Locations, Habitats, and Ecosystems from Scientific Papers in Invasion Biology: A Large-Scale Exploratory Study with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an exploratory study that harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to mine key ecological entities from invasion biology literature. Specifically, we focus on extracting species names, their locations, associated habitats, and ecosystems, information that is critical for understanding species spread, predicting future invasions, and informing conservation efforts. Traditional text mining approaches often struggle with the complexity of ecological terminology and the subtle linguistic patterns found in these texts. By applying general-purpose LLMs without domain-specific fine-tuning, we uncover both the promise and limitations of using these models for ecological entity extraction. In doing so, this study lays the groundwork for more advanced, automated knowledge extraction tools that can aid researchers and practitioners in understanding and managing biological invasions.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis on Machine Learning based Methods for Lung Cancer Level Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lung cancer is a major issue in worldwide public health, requiring early diagnosis using stable techniques. This work begins a thorough investigation of the use of machine learning (ML) methods for precise classification of lung cancer stages. A cautious analysis is performed to overcome overfitting issues in model performance, taking into account minimum child weight and learning rate. A set of machine learning (ML) models including XGBoost (XGB), LGBM, Adaboost, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), CatBoost, and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) are run methodically and contrasted. Furthermore, the correlation between features and targets is examined using the deep neural network (DNN) model and thus their capability in detecting complex patternsis established. It is argued that several ML models can be capable of classifying lung cancer stages with great accuracy. In spite of the complexity of DNN architectures, traditional ML models like XGBoost, LGBM, and Logistic Regression excel with superior performance. The models perform better than the others in lung cancer prediction on the complete set of comparative metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score</description>

      <title>Efficient Neural Theorem Proving via Fine-grained Proof Structure Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synergy between deep learning models and traditional automation tools plays a pivotal role in developing robust neural theorem provers (NTPs). However, for proof synthesis with LLMs, previous work applies automation tools either only when the model explicitly calls the method, or only at a single granularity level, failing to fully exploit the power of built-in tactics and off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. In this work, we propose ProofAug, a novel theorem proving method that enjoys superior sample efficiency through equipping proof-generation LLMs with automation methods in different granularities via fine-grained structure analysis of model-generated proof proposals. Furthermore, ProofAug serves as a versatile plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with any tree-search algorithm, enabling our construction of an efficient recursive proving (ERP) module to further enhance performance. The superiority of our method is validated on the miniF2F-test benchmark using the open-source deepseek-math-7b-base model and the Isabelle proof assistant. Notably, by additionally employing a mixed prompting strategy, we achieve a cumulative pass rate of 66.0% after curation of the dataset (61.9% for the original version), setting a new SOTA across all proof languages with a total sample budget of only 2100. Our code is available at https://github.com/haoxiongliu/ProofAug.</description>

      <title>CodeBrain: Impute Any Brain MRI via Instance-specific Scalar-quantized Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MRI imputation aims to synthesize the missing modality from one or more available ones, which is highly desirable since it reduces scanning costs and delivers comprehensive MRI information to enhance clinical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a unified model, CodeBrain, designed to adapt to various brain MRI imputation scenarios. The core design lies in casting various inter-modality transformations as a full-modality code prediction task. To this end, CodeBrain is trained in two stages: Reconstruction and Code Prediction. First, in the Reconstruction stage, we reconstruct each MRI modality, which is mapped into a shared latent space followed by a scalar quantization. Since such quantization is lossy and the code is low dimensional, another MRI modality belonging to the same subject is randomly selected to generate common features to supplement the code and boost the target reconstruction. In the second stage, we train another encoder by a customized grading loss to predict the full-modality codes from randomly masked MRI samples, supervised by the corresponding quantized codes generated from the first stage. In this way, the inter-modality transformation is achieved by mapping the instance-specific codes in a finite scalar space. We evaluated the proposed CodeBrain model on two public brain MRI datasets (i.e., IXI and BraTS 2023). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CodeBrain model achieves superior imputation performance compared to four existing methods, establishing a new state of the art for unified brain MRI imputation. Codes will be released.</description>

Abstract: Faithfulness is the foundation of probability distribution and graph in causal discovery and causal inference. In this paper, several unfaithful probability distribution examples are constructed in three--vertices binary causality directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, which are not faithful to causal DAGs described in J.M.,Robins,et al. Uniform consistency in causal inference. Biometrika (2003),90(3): 491--515. And the general unfaithful probability distribution with multiple independence and conditional independence in binary triple causal DAG is given.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning of Surrogate Models: Integrating Domain Warping and Affine Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate models provide efficient alternatives to computationally demanding real-world processes but often require large datasets for effective training. A promising solution to this limitation is the transfer of pre-trained surrogate models to new tasks. Previous studies have investigated the transfer of differentiable and non-differentiable surrogate models, typically assuming an affine transformation between the source and target functions. This paper extends previous research by addressing a broader range of transformations, including linear and nonlinear variations. Specifically, we consider the combination of an unknown input warping, such as one modelled by the beta cumulative distribution function, with an unspecified affine transformation. Our approach achieves transfer learning by employing a limited number of data points from the target task to optimize these transformations, minimizing empirical loss on the transfer dataset. We validate the proposed method on the widely used Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) testbed and a real-world transfer learning task from the automobile industry. The results underscore the significant advantages of the approach, revealing that the transferred surrogate significantly outperforms both the original surrogate and the one built from scratch using the transfer dataset, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.</description>

      <title>State Stream Transformer (SST) : Emergent Metacognitive Behaviours Through Latent State Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the State Stream Transformer (SST), a novel LLM architecture that reveals emergent reasoning behaviours and capabilities latent in pretrained weights through addressing a fundamental limitation in traditional transformer models: the lack of latent computational continuity across autoregressive generations in the state space. SST introduces a sliding window latent state (FFN) cache with weighted decay that maintains and evolves persistent latent processes throughout autoregressive generations. Through controlled experiments comparing base and SST architectures using the same frozen weights, we demonstrate that this architectural modification alone enables enhanced reasoning capabilities which appear best explained by some form of potential higher-order processing, as evidenced by emergent metacognitive behaviours. These behaviours persist under controlled conditions designed to eliminate confounding factors such as stochastic variation or learned response patterns. Analysis of latent state distributions and processing dynamics provides evidence that it is solely the 'state stream' that is responsible for these phenomena. In quantitative evaluations, the SST achieves substantial performance improvements over the base model on two reasoning benchmarks, reaching 89.01\% accuracy on GSM-8K (0-shot) and 91.04\% on ARC Challenge (0-shot CoT). These findings indicate that persistent computation in the latent state space enables fundamentally different information processing and internal reasoning strategies, with implications for our understanding of artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>A Learnable Multi-views Contrastive Framework with Reconstruction Discrepancy for Medical Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In medical time series disease diagnosis, two key challenges are identified.First, the high annotation cost of medical data leads to overfitting in models trained on label-limited, single-center datasets. To address this, we propose incorporating external data from related tasks and leveraging AE-GAN to extract prior knowledge,providing valuable references for downstream tasks. Second, many existing studies employ contrastive learning to derive more generalized medical sequence representations for diagnostic tasks, usually relying on manually designed diverse positive and negative sample pairs.However, these approaches are complex, lack generalizability, and fail to adaptively capture disease-specific features across different conditions.To overcome this, we introduce LMCF (Learnable Multi-views Contrastive Framework), a framework that integrates a multi-head attention mechanism and adaptively learns representations from different views through inter-view and intra-view contrastive learning strategies.Additionally, the pre-trained AE-GAN is used to reconstruct discrepancies in the target data as disease probabilities, which are then integrated into the contrastive learning process.Experiments on three target datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms seven other baselines, highlighting its significant impact on healthcare applications such as the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transformer for High Resolution Image Motion Deblurring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and improvement of the Restormer architecture for high-resolution image motion deblurring. We introduce architectural modifications that reduce model complexity by 18.4% while maintaining or improving performance through optimized attention mechanisms. Our enhanced training pipeline incorporates additional transformations including color jitter, Gaussian blur, and perspective transforms to improve model robustness as well as a new frequency loss term. Extensive experiments on the RealBlur-R, RealBlur-J, and Ultra-High-Definition Motion blurred (UHDM) datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The improved architecture shows better convergence behavior and reduced training time while maintaining competitive performance across challenging scenarios. We also provide detailed ablation studies analyzing the impact of our modifications on model behavior and performance. Our results suggest that thoughtful architectural simplification combined with enhanced training strategies can yield more efficient yet equally capable models for motion deblurring tasks.

      <description>arXiv:2501.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for obtaining statistically guaranteed confidence bands for functional machine learning techniques: surrogate models which map between function spaces, motivated by the need build reliable PDE emulators. The method constructs nested confidence sets on a low-dimensional representation (an SVD) of the surrogate model's prediction error, and then maps these sets to the prediction space using set-propagation techniques. The result are conformal-like coverage guaranteed prediction sets for functional surrogate models. We use zonotopes as basis of the set construction, due to their well studied set-propagation and verification properties. The method is model agnostic and can thus be applied to complex Sci-ML models, including Neural Operators, but also in simpler settings. We also elicit a technique to capture the truncation error of the SVD, ensuring the guarantees of the method.</description>

      <title>Solving Drone Routing Problems with Quantum Computing: A Hybrid Approach Combining Quantum Annealing and Gate-Based Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach to solving real-world drone routing problems by leveraging the capabilities of quantum computing. The proposed method, coined Quantum for Drone Routing (Q4DR), integrates the two most prominent paradigms in the field: quantum gate-based computing, through the Eclipse Qrisp programming language; and quantum annealers, by means of D-Wave System's devices. The algorithm is divided into two different phases: an initial clustering phase executed using a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and a routing phase employing quantum annealers. The efficacy of Q4DR is demonstrated through three use cases of increasing complexity, each incorporating real-world constraints such as asymmetric costs, forbidden paths, and itinerant charging points. This research contributes to the growing body of work in quantum optimization, showcasing the practical applications of quantum computing in logistics and route planning.</description>

Its capabilities have demonstrated outstanding performance in several tasks, including creative thinking, code generation, maths and automated program repair, at apparently lower execution cost. However, LLMs must adhere to an important qualitative property, i.e., their alignment with safety and human values. A clear competitor of DeepSeek-R1 is its American counterpart, OpenAI's o3-mini model, which is expected to set high standards in terms of performance, safety and cost. In this paper we conduct a systematic assessment of the safety level of both, DeepSeek-R1 (70b version) and OpenAI's o3-mini (beta version). To this end, we make use of our recently released automated safety testing tool, named ASTRAL. By leveraging this tool, we automatically and systematically generate and execute a total of 1260 unsafe test inputs on both models. After conducting a semi-automated assessment of the outcomes provided by both LLMs, the results indicate that DeepSeek-R1 is highly unsafe as compared to OpenAI's o3-mini. Based on our evaluation, DeepSeek-R1 answered unsafely to 11.98% of the executed prompts whereas o3-mini only to 1.19%.</description>

Abstract: This report provides an overview of the workshop titled Autonomy and Safety Assurance in the Early Development of Robotics and Autonomous Systems, hosted by the Centre for Robotic Autonomy in Demanding and Long-Lasting Environments (CRADLE) on September 2, 2024, at The University of Manchester, UK. The event brought together representatives from six regulatory and assurance bodies across diverse sectors to discuss challenges and evidence for ensuring the safety of autonomous and robotic systems, particularly autonomous inspection robots (AIR). The workshop featured six invited talks by the regulatory and assurance bodies. CRADLE aims to make assurance an integral part of engineering reliable, transparent, and trustworthy autonomous systems. Key discussions revolved around three research questions: (i) challenges in assuring safety for AIR; (ii) evidence for safety assurance; and (iii) how assurance cases need to differ for autonomous systems. Following the invited talks, the breakout groups further discussed the research questions using case studies from ground (rail), nuclear, underwater, and drone-based AIR. This workshop offered a valuable opportunity for representatives from industry, academia, and regulatory bodies to discuss challenges related to assured autonomy. Feedback from participants indicated a strong willingness to adopt a design-for-assurance process to ensure that robots are developed and verified to meet regulatory expectations.</description>

      <title>Clustering Properties of Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods via joint embedding architectures have proven remarkably effective at capturing semantically rich representations with strong clustering properties, magically in the absence of label supervision. Despite this, few of them have explored leveraging these untapped properties to improve themselves. In this paper, we provide an evidence through various metrics that the encoder's output $encoding$ exhibits superior and more stable clustering properties compared to other components. Building on this insight, we propose a novel positive-feedback SSL method, termed Representation Soft Assignment (ReSA), which leverages the model's clustering properties to promote learning in a self-guided manner. Extensive experiments on standard SSL benchmarks reveal that models pretrained with ReSA outperform other state-of-the-art SSL methods by a significant margin. Finally, we analyze how ReSA facilitates better clustering properties, demonstrating that it effectively enhances clustering performance at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels, shaping representations that are inherently more structured and semantically meaningful.</description>

      <title>Beyond Instructed Tasks: Recognizing In-the-Wild Reading Behaviors in the Classroom Using Eye Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding reader behaviors such as skimming, deep reading, and scanning is essential for improving educational instruction. While prior eye-tracking studies have trained models to recognize reading behaviors, they often rely on instructed reading tasks, which can alter natural behaviors and limit the applicability of these findings to in-the-wild settings. Additionally, there is a lack of clear definitions for reading behavior archetypes in the literature. We conducted a classroom study to address these issues by collecting instructed and in-the-wild reading data. We developed a mixed-method framework, including a human-driven theoretical model, statistical analyses, and an AI classifier, to differentiate reading behaviors based on their velocity, density, and sequentiality. Our lightweight 2D CNN achieved an F1 score of 0.8 for behavior recognition, providing a robust approach for understanding in-the-wild reading. This work advances our ability to provide detailed behavioral insights to educators, supporting more targeted and effective assessment and instruction.</description>

      <title>CLoQ: Enhancing Fine-Tuning of Quantized LLMs via Calibrated LoRA Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a highly efficient approach for downstream tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources. However, applying LoRA techniques to quantized LLMs poses unique challenges due to the reduced representational precision of quantized weights. In this paper, we introduce CLoQ (Calibrated LoRA initialization for Quantized LLMs), a simplistic initialization strategy designed to overcome these challenges. Our approach focuses on minimizing the layer-wise discrepancy between the original LLM and its quantized counterpart with LoRA components during initialization. By leveraging a small calibration dataset, CLoQ quantizes a pre-trained LLM and determines the optimal LoRA components for each layer, ensuring a strong foundation for subsequent fine-tuning. A key contribution of this work is a novel theoretical result that enables the accurate and closed-form construction of these optimal LoRA components. We validate the efficacy of CLoQ across multiple tasks such as language generation, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms existing LoRA fine-tuning methods for quantized LLMs, especially at ultra low-bit widths.</description>

      <title>Curriculum-based Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Robust Stabilization of a Quadrotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a curriculum learning approach to develop a reinforcement learning-based robust stabilizing controller for a Quadrotor that meets predefined performance criteria. The learning objective is to achieve desired positions from random initial conditions while adhering to both transient and steady-state performance specifications. This objective is challenging for conventional one-stage end-to-end reinforcement learning, due to the strong coupling between position and orientation dynamics, the complexity in designing and tuning the reward function, and poor sample efficiency, which necessitates substantial computational resources and leads to extended convergence times. To address these challenges, this work decomposes the learning objective into a three-stage curriculum that incrementally increases task complexity. The curriculum begins with learning to achieve stable hovering from a fixed initial condition, followed by progressively introducing randomization in initial positions, orientations and velocities. A novel additive reward function is proposed, to incorporate transient and steady-state performance specifications. The results demonstrate that the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based curriculum learning approach, coupled with the proposed reward structure, achieves superior performance compared to a single-stage PPO-trained policy with the same reward function, while significantly reducing computational resource requirements and convergence time. The curriculum-trained policy's performance and robustness are thoroughly validated under random initial conditions and in the presence of disturbances.</description>

      <title>GuardReasoner: Towards Reasoning-based LLM Safeguards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As LLMs increasingly impact safety-critical applications, ensuring their safety using guardrails remains a key challenge. This paper proposes GuardReasoner, a new safeguard for LLMs, by guiding the guard model to learn to reason. Concretely, we first create the GuardReasonerTrain dataset, which consists of 127K samples with 460K detailed reasoning steps. Then, we introduce reasoning SFT to unlock the reasoning capability of guard models. In addition, we present hard sample DPO to further strengthen their reasoning ability. In this manner, GuardReasoner achieves better performance, explainability, and generalizability. Extensive experiments and analyses on 13 benchmarks of 3 guardrail tasks demonstrate its superiority. Remarkably, GuardReasoner 8B surpasses GPT-4o+CoT by 5.74% and LLaMA Guard 3 8B by 20.84% F1 score on average. We release the training data, code, and models with different scales (1B, 3B, 8B) of GuardReasoner : https://github.com/yueliu1999/GuardReasoner/.</description>

      <title>Beyond Prior Limits: Addressing Distribution Misalignment in Particle Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle filtering is a Bayesian inference method and a fundamental tool in state estimation for dynamic systems, but its effectiveness is often limited by the constraints of the initial prior distribution, a phenomenon we define as the Prior Boundary Phenomenon. This challenge arises when target states lie outside the prior's support, rendering traditional particle filtering methods inadequate for accurate estimation. Although techniques like unbounded priors and larger particle sets have been proposed, they remain computationally prohibitive and lack adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To systematically overcome these limitations, we propose the Diffusion-Enhanced Particle Filtering Framework, which introduces three key innovations: adaptive diffusion through exploratory particles, entropy-driven regularisation to prevent weight collapse, and kernel-based perturbations for dynamic support expansion. These mechanisms collectively enable particle filtering to explore beyond prior boundaries, ensuring robust state estimation for out-of-boundary targets. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments validate framework's effectiveness, indicating significant improvements in success rates and estimation accuracy across high-dimensional and non-convex scenarios.</description>

      <title>CLEAR: Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition Applied to Sustainability Data Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Data-Driven Approach For Analyzing And Predicting Inpatient Length Of Stay In Health Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patient length of stay (LoS) is a critical metric for evaluating the efficacy of hospital management. The primary objectives encompass to improve efficiency and reduce costs while enhancing patient outcomes and hospital capacity within the patient journey. By seamlessly merging data-driven techniques with simulation methodologies, the study proposes an all-encompassing framework for the optimization of patient flow. Using a comprehensive dataset of 2.3 million de-identified patient records, we analyzed demographics, diagnoses, treatments, services, costs, and charges with machine learning models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Adaboost, LightGBM) and Python tools (Spark, AWS clusters, dimensionality reduction). Our model predicts patient length of stay (LoS) upon admission using supervised learning algorithms. This hybrid approach enables the identification of key factors influencing LoS, offering a robust framework for hospitals to streamline patient flow and resource utilization. The research focuses on patient flow, corroborating the efficacy of the approach, illustrating decreased patient length of stay within a real healthcare environment. The findings underscore the potential of hybrid data-driven models in transforming hospital management practices. This innovative methodology provides generally flexible decision-making, training, and patient flow enhancement; such a system could have huge implications for healthcare administration and overall satisfaction with healthcare.</description>

      <title>Can we Retrieve Everything All at Once? ARM: An Alignment-Oriented LLM-based Retrieval Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world open-domain questions can be complicated, particularly when answering them involves information from multiple information sources. LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in decomposing complex tasks into simpler steps, and previous work has used it for better retrieval in support of complex questions. However, LLM's decomposition of questions is unaware of what data is available and how data is organized, often leading to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. Recent effort in agentic RAG proposes to perform retrieval in an iterative fashion, where a followup query is derived as an action based on previous rounds of retrieval. While this provides one way of interacting with the data collection, agentic RAG's exploration of data is inefficient because successive queries depend on previous results rather than being guided by the organization of available data in the collection. To address this problem, we propose an LLM-based retrieval method -- ARM, that aims to better align the question with the organization of the data collection by exploring relationships among data objects beyond matching the utterance of the query, thus leading to a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries. We evaluated ARM on two datasets, Bird and OTT-QA. On Bird, it outperforms standard RAG with query decomposition by up to 5.2 pt in execution accuracy and agentic RAG (ReAct) by up to 15.9 pt. On OTT-QA, it achieves up to 5.5 pt and 19.3 pt higher F1 match scores compared to these approaches.</description>

      <title>BounTCHA: A CAPTCHA Utilizing Boundary Identification in AI-extended Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) especially multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), has enabled it to understand text, images, videos, and other multimedia data, allowing AI systems to execute various tasks based on human-provided prompts. However, AI-powered bots have increasingly been able to bypass most existing CAPTCHA systems, posing significant security threats to web applications. This makes the design of new CAPTCHA mechanisms an urgent priority. We observe that humans are highly sensitive to shifts and abrupt changes in videos, while current AI systems still struggle to comprehend and respond to such situations effectively. Based on this observation, we design and implement BounTCHA, a CAPTCHA mechanism that leverages human perception of boundaries in video transitions and disruptions. By utilizing AI's capability to expand original videos with prompts, we introduce unexpected twists and changes to create a pipeline for generating short videos for CAPTCHA purposes. We develop a prototype and conduct experiments to collect data on humans' time biases in boundary identification. This data serves as a basis for distinguishing between human users and bots. Additionally, we perform a detailed security analysis of BounTCHA, demonstrating its resilience against various types of attacks. We hope that BounTCHA will act as a robust defense, safeguarding millions of web applications in the AI-driven era.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Powered Inference with Imputed Covariates and Nonuniform Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used to produce predictions that serve as input data in subsequent statistical analyses. For example, computer vision predictions of economic and environmental indicators based on satellite imagery are used in downstream regressions; similarly, language models are widely used to approximate human ratings and opinions in social science research. However, failure to properly account for errors in the machine learning predictions renders standard statistical procedures invalid. Prior work uses what we call the Predict-Then-Debias estimator to give valid confidence intervals when machine learning algorithms impute missing variables, assuming a small complete sample from the population of interest. We expand the scope by introducing bootstrap confidence intervals that apply when the complete data is a nonuniform (i.e., weighted, stratified, or clustered) sample and to settings where an arbitrary subset of features is imputed. Importantly, the method can be applied to many settings without requiring additional calculations. We prove that these confidence intervals are valid under no assumptions on the quality of the machine learning model and are no wider than the intervals obtained by methods that do not use machine learning predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training data quality is one of the most important drivers of final model quality. In this work, we introduce a method for evaluating data integrity based on the assumption that low-quality input prompts result in high variance and low quality responses. This is achieved by measuring the rejected response quality and the reward gap between the chosen and rejected preference pair. Our method, Rejecting Instruction Preferences (RIP) can be used to filter prompts from existing training sets, or to make high quality synthetic datasets, yielding large performance gains across various benchmarks compared to unfiltered data. Using Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct, RIP improves AlpacaEval2 LC Win Rate by 9.4%, Arena-Hard by 8.7%, and WildBench by 9.9%. Using Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct, RIP improves Arena-Hard from 67.5 to 82.9, which is from 18th place to 6th overall in the leaderboard.</description>

      <title>Inkspire: Supporting Design Exploration with Generative AI through Analogical Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With recent advancements in the capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) AI models, product designers have begun experimenting with them in their work. However, T2I models struggle to interpret abstract language and the current user experience of T2I tools can induce design fixation rather than a more iterative, exploratory process. To address these challenges, we developed Inkspire, a sketch-driven tool that supports designers in prototyping product design concepts with analogical inspirations and a complete sketch-to-design-to-sketch feedback loop. To inform the design of Inkspire, we conducted an exchange session with designers and distilled design goals for improving T2I interactions. In a within-subjects study comparing Inkspire to ControlNet, we found that Inkspire supported designers with more inspiration and exploration of design ideas, and improved aspects of the co-creative process by allowing designers to effectively grasp the current state of the AI to guide it towards novel design intentions.</description>

      <title>Advances in Multimodal Adaptation and Generalization: From Traditional Approaches to Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, achieving domain adaptation and generalization poses significant challenges, as models must adapt to or generalize across unknown target distributions. Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions. We maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature at https://github.com/donghao51/Awesome-Multimodal-Adaptation.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Autoencoders are Scalable Image Tokenizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenizing images into compact visual representations is a key step in learning efficient and high-quality image generative models. We present a simple diffusion tokenizer (DiTo) that learns compact visual representations for image generation models. Our key insight is that a single learning objective, diffusion L2 loss, can be used for training scalable image tokenizers. Since diffusion is already widely used for image generation, our insight greatly simplifies training such tokenizers. In contrast, current state-of-the-art tokenizers rely on an empirically found combination of heuristics and losses, thus requiring a complex training recipe that relies on non-trivially balancing different losses and pretrained supervised models. We show design decisions, along with theoretical grounding, that enable us to scale DiTo for learning competitive image representations. Our results show that DiTo is a simpler, scalable, and self-supervised alternative to the current state-of-the-art image tokenizer which is supervised. DiTo achieves competitive or better quality than state-of-the-art in image reconstruction and downstream image generation tasks.</description>

      <title>DeltaLLM: Compress LLMs with Low-Rank Deltas between Shared Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DeltaLLM, a new post-training compression technique to reduce the memory footprint of LLMs. We propose an alternative way of structuring LLMs with weight sharing between layers in subsequent Transformer blocks, along with additional low-rank difference matrices between them. For training, we adopt the progressing module replacement method and show that the lightweight training of the low-rank modules with approximately 30M-40M tokens is sufficient to achieve performance on par with LLMs of comparable sizes trained from scratch. We release the resultant models, DeltaLLAMA and DeltaPHI, with a 12% parameter reduction, retaining 90% of the performance of the base Llama and Phi models on common knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. Our method also outperforms compression techniques JointDrop, LaCo, ShortGPT and SliceGPT with the same number of parameters removed. For example, DeltaPhi 2.9B with a 24% reduction achieves similar average zero-shot accuracies as recovery fine-tuned SlicedPhi 3.3B with a 12% reduction, despite being approximately 400M parameters smaller with no fine-tuning applied. This work provides new insights into LLM architecture design and compression methods when storage space is critical.</description>

      <title>\copyright Plug-in Authorization for Human Content Copyright Protection in Text-to-Image Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the contentious issue of copyright infringement in images generated by text-to-image models, sparking debates among AI developers, content creators, and legal entities. State-of-the-art models create high-quality content without crediting original creators, causing concern in the artistic community. To mitigate this, we propose the \copyright Plug-in Authorization framework, introducing three operations: addition, extraction, and combination. Addition involves training a \copyright plug-in for specific copyright, facilitating proper credit attribution. Extraction allows creators to reclaim copyright from infringing models, and combination enables users to merge different \copyright plug-ins. These operations act as permits, incentivizing fair use and providing flexibility in authorization. We present innovative approaches,"Reverse LoRA" for extraction and "EasyMerge" for seamless combination. Experiments in artist-style replication and cartoon IP recreation demonstrate \copyright plug-ins' effectiveness, offering a valuable solution for human copyright protection in the age of generative AIs. The code is available at https://github.com/zc1023/-Plug-in-Authorization.git.</description>

      <title>Declarative Design of Neural Predicates in Neuro-Symbolic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic systems (NeSy), which claim to combine the best of both learning and reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence, are missing a core property of reasoning systems: Declarativeness. The lack of declarativeness is caused by the functional nature of neural predicates inherited from neural networks. We propose and implement a general framework for fully declarative neural predicates, which hence extends to fully declarative NeSy frameworks. We first show that the declarative extension preserves the learning and reasoning capabilities while being able to answer arbitrary queries while only being trained on a single query type.</description>

      <title>Show, Don't Tell: Evaluating Large Language Models Beyond Textual Understanding with ChildPlay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic benchmark set to test the generalization of state-of-the-art large language models on broader problems beyond linguistic tasks and evaluate it on a systematic progression of GPT models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini). Using well-known simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Battleship, all encoded in ASCII, we test their strategic capabilities and spatial reasoning. To probe generalization, we introduce three new games: LEGO Connect Language (LCL) for spatial logic, a shape recognition game, and Guess-the-SMILES (GtS), an advanced spatial logic benchmark in chemistry. Results show that, despite proficiency in standard benchmarks, GPT models perform poorly in these games, failing to anticipate losing moves, play correctly, or recognize spatial relationships. Except for Tic-Tac-Toe and GtS, a systematic progression in gameplay performance as models are formally improved (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o) is not observed. GPT-4 succeeds in shape recognition, but all models consistently struggle with LCL and GtS. This suggests that while GPT models can emulate conversational proficiency and basic rule comprehension, they have limited cognitive flexibility and generalization in strategy and spatial reasoning. Our findings, highlighted with our benchmark suite (ChildPlay GitHub Repository), caution against claims of emergent intelligence in GPT models, which appear more specialized than general.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Veil of Similarity: Quantifying Semantic Continuity in Explainable AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel metric for measuring semantic continuity in Explainable AI methods and machine learning models. We posit that for models to be truly interpretable and trustworthy, similar inputs should yield similar explanations, reflecting a consistent semantic understanding. By leveraging XAI techniques, we assess semantic continuity in the task of image recognition. We conduct experiments to observe how incremental changes in input affect the explanations provided by different XAI methods. Through this approach, we aim to evaluate the models' capability to generalize and abstract semantic concepts accurately and to evaluate different XAI methods in correctly capturing the model behaviour. This paper contributes to the broader discourse on AI interpretability by proposing a quantitative measure for semantic continuity for XAI methods, offering insights into the models' and explainers' internal reasoning processes, and promoting more reliable and transparent AI systems.</description>

      <title>EVINCE: Optimizing Multi-LLM Dialogues Using Conditional Statistics and Information Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14575v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: EVINCE (Entropy and Variation IN Conditional Exchanges) is a novel framework for optimizing multi-LLM dialogues using conditional statistics and information theory. It addresses limitations in multi-agent debate (MAS) frameworks, where multiple LLMs ``chat'' without behavior modulation or mutual information quality assessment. Using dual entropy optimization to balance perspective diversity and prior knowledge, $\EVINCE$ provides quantitative tools to dynamically regulate LLM linguistic behaviors. When mutual information is low and both cross-entropy and Wasserstein distance are high, EVINCE promotes contentious dialogues to expose diverse perspectives and uncover inconsistencies. Conversely, as cross-entropy decreases and mutual information stabilizes, it transitions discussions into a conciliatory phase, encouraging compromise and acknowledgment of valid points. Using information-theoretic metrics and optimizing mutual information, $\EVINCE$ emerges as a structured and highly effective framework for multi-LLM collaboration.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of team selection within multiagent adversarial team games. We propose BERTeam, a novel algorithm that uses a transformer-based deep neural network with Masked Language Model training to select the best team of players from a trained population. We integrate this with coevolutionary deep reinforcement learning, which trains a diverse set of individual players to choose from. We test our algorithm in the multiagent adversarial game Marine Capture-The-Flag, and find that BERTeam learns non-trivial team compositions that perform well against unseen opponents. For this game, we find that BERTeam outperforms MCAA, an algorithm that similarly optimizes team selection.</description>

Abstract: Gradual semantics (GS) have demonstrated great potential in argumentation, in particular for deploying quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs) in a number of real-world settings, from judgmental forecasting to explainable AI. In this paper, we provide a novel methodology for obtaining GS for statement graphs, a form of structured argumentation framework, where arguments and relations between them are built from logical statements. Our methodology differs from existing approaches in the literature in two main ways. First, it naturally accommodates incomplete information, so that arguments with partially specified premises can play a meaningful role in the evaluation. Second, it is modularly defined to leverage on any GS for QBAFs. We also define a set of novel properties for our GS and study their suitability alongside a set of existing properties (adapted to our setting) for two instantiations of our GS, demonstrating their advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>An Automatic Sound and Complete Abstraction Method for Generalized Planning with Baggable Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized planning is concerned with how to find a single plan to solve multiple similar planning instances. Abstractions are widely used for solving generalized planning, and QNP (qualitative numeric planning) is a popular abstract model. Recently, Cui et al. showed that a plan solves a sound and complete abstraction of a generalized planning problem if and only if the refined plan solves the original problem. However, existing work on automatic abstraction for generalized planning can hardly guarantee soundness let alone completeness. In this paper, we propose an automatic sound and complete abstraction method for generalized planning with baggable types. We use a variant of QNP, called bounded QNP (BQNP), where integer variables are increased or decreased by only one. Since BQNP is undecidable, we propose and implement a sound but incomplete solver for BQNP. We present an automatic method to abstract a BQNP problem from a classical planning instance with baggable types. The basic idea for abstraction is to introduce a counter for each bag of indistinguishable tuples of objects. We define a class of domains called proper baggable domains, and show that for such domains, the BQNP problem got by our automatic method is a sound and complete abstraction for a generalized planning problem whose instances share the same bags with the given instance but the sizes of the bags might be different. Thus, the refined plan of a solution to the BQNP problem is a solution to the generalized planning problem. Finally, we implement our abstraction method and experiments on a number of domains demonstrate the promise of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have shown remarkable abilities in text generation, question answering, language translation, reasoning and many other tasks. It continues to advance rapidly and is becoming increasingly influential in various fields, from technology and business to education and entertainment. Despite LLM's success in multiple areas, its ability to play abstract games, such as chess, is underexplored. Chess-playing requires the language models to output legal and reasonable moves from textual inputs. Here, we propose the Large language model ChessLLM to play full chess games. We transform the game into a textual format with the best move represented in the Forsyth-Edwards Notation. We show that by simply supervised fine-tuning, our model has achieved a professional-level Elo rating of 1788 in matches against the standard Elo-rated Stockfish when permitted to sample 10 times. We further show that data quality is important. Long-round data supervision enjoys a 350 Elo rating improvement over short-round data.</description>

      <title>From Natural Language to Extensive-Form Game Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for translating game descriptions in natural language into extensive-form representations in game theory, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning. Given the varying levels of strategic complexity in games, such as perfect versus imperfect information, directly applying in-context learning would be insufficient. To address this, we introduce a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets along and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline models in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.</description>

      <title>Probing LLM World Models: Enhancing Guesstimation with Wisdom of Crowds Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guesstimation, the task of making approximate quantity estimates, is a common real-world challenge. However, it has been largely overlooked in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) research. We introduce a novel guesstimation dataset, MARBLES. This dataset requires one to estimate how many items (e.g., marbles) can fit into containers (e.g., a one-cup measuring cup), both with and without accompanying images. Inspired by the social science concept of the ``Wisdom of Crowds'' (WOC) - taking the median from estimates from a crowd), which has proven effective in guesstimation, we propose ``WOC decoding'' strategy for LLM guesstimation. We show that LLMs/VLMs perform well on guesstimation, suggesting that they possess some level of a "world model" necessary for guesstimation. Moreover, similar to human performance, the WOC decoding method improves LLM/VLM guesstimation accuracy. Furthermore, the inclusion of images in the multimodal condition enhances model performance. These results highlight the value of WOC decoding strategy for LLMs/VLMs and position guesstimation as a probe for evaluating LLMs/VLMs' world model. As LLMs' world model is a fundamental prerequisite for many real-world tasks, e.g., human-AI teaming, our findings have broad implications for the AI community.</description>

      <title>Beyond Predictions in Neural ODEs: Identification and Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.12430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spurred by tremendous success in pattern matching and prediction tasks, researchers increasingly resort to machine learning to aid original scientific discovery. Given large amounts of observational data about a system, can we uncover the rules that govern its evolution? Solving this task holds the great promise of fully understanding the causal interactions and being able to make reliable predictions about the system's behavior under interventions. We take a step towards answering this question for time-series data generated from systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While the governing ODEs might not be identifiable from data alone, we show that combining simple regularization schemes with flexible neural ODEs can robustly recover the dynamics and causal structures from time-series data. Our results on a variety of (non)-linear first and second order systems as well as real data validate our method. We conclude by showing that we can also make accurate predictions under interventions on variables or the system itself.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Optimal Decision Trees using Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19706v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global optimization of decision trees has shown to be promising in terms of accuracy, size, and consequently human comprehensibility. However, many of the methods used rely on general-purpose solvers for which scalability remains an issue. Dynamic programming methods have been shown to scale much better because they exploit the tree structure by solving subtrees as independent subproblems. However, this only works when an objective can be optimized separately for subtrees. We explore this relationship in detail and show the necessary and sufficient conditions for such separability and generalize previous dynamic programming approaches into a framework that can optimize any combination of separable objectives and constraints. Experiments on five application domains show the general applicability of this framework, while outperforming the scalability of general-purpose solvers by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Virtual Human Generative Model: Masked Modeling Approach for Learning Human Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the relationship between healthcare attributes, lifestyles, and personality is vital for understanding and improving physical and mental well-being. Machine learning approaches are promising for modeling their relationships and offering actionable suggestions. In this paper, we propose the Virtual Human Generative Model (VHGM), a novel deep generative model capable of estimating over 2,000 attributes across healthcare, lifestyle, and personality domains. VHGM leverages masked modeling to learn the joint distribution of attributes, enabling accurate predictions and robust conditional sampling. We deploy VHGM as a web service, showcasing its versatility in driving diverse healthcare applications aimed at improving user well-being. Through extensive quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate VHGM's superior performance in attribute imputation and high-quality sample generation compared to existing baselines. This work highlights VHGM as a powerful tool for personalized healthcare and lifestyle management, with broad implications for data-driven health solutions.</description>

      <title>Computing the gradients with respect to all parameters of a quantum neural network using a single circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding gradients is a crucial step in training machine learning models. For quantum neural networks, computing gradients using the parameter-shift rule requires calculating the cost function twice for each adjustable parameter in the network. When the total number of parameters is large, the quantum circuit must be repeatedly adjusted and executed, leading to significant computational overhead. Here we propose an approach to compute all gradients using a single circuit only, significantly reducing both the circuit depth and the number of classical registers required. We experimentally validate our approach on both quantum simulators and IBM's real quantum hardware, demonstrating that our method significantly reduces circuit compilation time compared to the conventional approach, resulting in a substantial speedup in total runtime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and interpretable diagnostic models are crucial in the safety-critical field of medicine. We investigate the interpretability of our proposed biomarker-based lung ultrasound diagnostic pipeline to enhance clinicians' diagnostic capabilities. The objective of this study is to assess whether explanations from a decision tree classifier, utilizing biomarkers, can improve users' ability to identify inaccurate model predictions compared to conventional saliency maps. Our findings demonstrate that decision tree explanations, based on clinically established biomarkers, can assist clinicians in detecting false positives, thus improving the reliability of diagnostic models in medicine.</description>

      <title>Slaves to the Law of Large Numbers: An Asymptotic Equipartition Property for Perplexity in Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a new asymptotic equipartition property for the perplexity of long texts generated by a language model and present supporting experimental evidence from open-source models. Specifically we show that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text generated by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This defines a "typical set" that all long synthetic texts generated by a language model must belong to. We show that this typical set is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct outputs. These results suggest possible applications to important practical problems such as (a) detecting synthetic AI-generated text, and (b) testing whether a text was used to train a language model. We make no simplifying assumptions (such as stationarity) about the statistics of language model outputs, and therefore our results are directly applicable to practical real-world models without any approximations.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Verification of Neural Networks using Branch and Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic verification of neural networks is concerned with formally analysing the output distribution of a neural network under a probability distribution of the inputs. Examples of probabilistic verification include verifying the demographic parity fairness notion or quantifying the safety of a neural network. We present a new algorithm for the probabilistic verification of neural networks based on an algorithm for computing and iteratively refining lower and upper bounds on probabilities over the outputs of a neural network. By applying state-of-the-art bound propagation and branch and bound techniques from non-probabilistic neural network verification, our algorithm significantly outpaces existing probabilistic verification algorithms, reducing solving times for various benchmarks from the literature from tens of minutes to tens of seconds. Furthermore, our algorithm compares favourably even to dedicated algorithms for restricted subsets of probabilistic verification. We complement our empirical evaluation with a theoretical analysis, proving that our algorithm is sound and, under mildly restrictive conditions, also complete when using a suitable set of heuristics.</description>

      <title>LLaMEA: A Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm for Automatically Generating Metaheuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have demonstrated their ability to understand natural language and generate complex code snippets. This paper introduces a novel Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, leveraging GPT models for the automated generation and refinement of algorithms. Given a set of criteria and a task definition (the search space), LLaMEA iteratively generates, mutates and selects algorithms based on performance metrics and feedback from runtime evaluations. This framework offers a unique approach to generating optimized algorithms without requiring extensive prior expertise. We show how this framework can be used to generate novel black-box metaheuristic optimization algorithms automatically. LLaMEA generates multiple algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy and Differential Evolution) on the five dimensional black box optimization benchmark (BBOB). The algorithms also show competitive performance on the 10- and 20-dimensional instances of the test functions, although they have not seen such instances during the automated generation process. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the framework and identify future directions for automated generation and optimization of algorithms via LLMs.</description>

      <title>Dual Thinking and Logical Processing -- Are Multi-modal Large Language Models Closing the Gap with Human Vision ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive processing and slower, logical processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ. We introduce an adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also aids in studying the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. The evidence underscores the importance of shape in identifying instances in human vision. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. Our study shows that segmentation models lack an understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to the position and number of sub-components. Additionally, the similarity in errors made by models and intuitive human processing indicates that models only address intuitive thinking in human vision. In contrast, multi-modal LLMs, including open-source models, demonstrate tremendous progress on errors made in intuitive processing. The models have improved performance on images that require logical reasoning and show recognition of sub-components. However, they have not matched the performance improvements made on errors in intuitive processing.</description>

      <title>LLaRA: Supercharging Robot Learning Data for Vision-Language Policy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently been leveraged to generate robotic actions, forming Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. However, directly adapting a pretrained VLM for robotic control remains challenging, particularly when constrained by a limited number of robot demonstrations. In this work, we introduce LLaRA: Large Language and Robotics Assistant, a framework that formulates robot action policy as visuo-textual conversations and enables an efficient transfer of a pretrained VLM into a powerful VLA, motivated by the success of visual instruction tuning in Computer Vision. First, we present an automated pipeline to generate conversation-style instruction tuning data for robots from existing behavior cloning datasets, aligning robotic actions with image pixel coordinates. Further, we enhance this dataset in a self-supervised manner by defining six auxiliary tasks, without requiring any additional action annotations. We show that a VLM finetuned with a limited amount of such datasets can produce meaningful action decisions for robotic control. Through experiments across multiple simulated and real-world tasks, we demonstrate that LLaRA achieves state-of-the-art performance while preserving the generalization capabilities of large language models. The code, datasets, and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/LostXine/LLaRA.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Boundary: Specialising Deep Configuration Performance Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software systems often have numerous configuration options that can be adjusted to meet different performance requirements. However, understanding the combined impact of these options on performance is often challenging, especially with limited real-world data. To tackle this issue, deep learning techniques have gained popularity due to their ability to capture complex relationships even with limited samples. This thesis begins with a systematic literature review of deep learning techniques in configuration performance modeling, analyzing 85 primary papers out of 948 searched papers. It identifies knowledge gaps and sets three objectives for the thesis. The first knowledge gap is the lack of understanding about which encoding scheme is better and in what circumstances. To address this, the thesis conducts an empirical study comparing three popular encoding schemes. Actionable suggestions are provided to support more reliable decisions. Another knowledge gap is the sparsity inherited from the configuration landscape. To handle this, the thesis proposes a model-agnostic and sparsity-robust framework called DaL, which uses a "divide-and-learn" approach. DaL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy improvement across various real-world systems. The thesis also addresses the limitation of predicting under static environments by proposing a sequential meta-learning framework called SeMPL. Unlike traditional meta-learning frameworks, SeMPL trains meta-environments in a specialized order, resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy in multi-environment scenarios. Overall, the thesis identifies and addresses critical knowledge gaps in deep performance learning, significantly advancing the accuracy of performance prediction.</description>

      <title>Retrieve, Summarize, Plan: Advancing Multi-hop Question Answering with an Iterative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-hop question answering is a challenging task with distinct industrial relevance, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods based on large language models (LLMs) have become a popular approach to tackle this task. Owing to the potential inability to retrieve all necessary information in a single iteration, a series of iterative RAG methods has been recently developed, showing significant performance improvements. However, existing methods still face two critical challenges: context overload resulting from multiple rounds of retrieval, and over-planning and repetitive planning due to the lack of a recorded retrieval trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative RAG method called ReSP, equipped with a dual-function summarizer. This summarizer compresses information from retrieved documents, targeting both the overarching question and the current sub-question concurrently. Experimental results on the multi-hop question-answering datasets HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, and exhibits excellent robustness concerning context length.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Uncertain Incompleteness for Robust Multimodal Sequential Diagnosis Prediction via Curriculum Data Erasing Guided Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19540v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present NECHO v2, a novel framework designed to enhance the predictive accuracy of multimodal sequential patient diagnoses under uncertain missing visit sequences, a common challenge in real clinical settings. Firstly, we modify NECHO, designed in a diagnosis code-centric fashion, to handle uncertain modality representation dominance under the imperfect data. Secondly, we develop a systematic knowledge distillation by employing the modified NECHO as both teacher and student. It encompasses a modality-wise contrastive and hierarchical distillation, transformer representation random distillation, along with other distillations to align representations between teacher and student tightly and effectively. We also propose curriculum learning guided random data erasing within sequences during both training and distillation of the teacher to lightly simulate scenario with missing visit information, thereby fostering effective knowledge transfer. As a result, NECHO v2 verifies itself by showing robust superiority in multimodal sequential diagnosis prediction under both balanced and imbalanced incomplete settings on multimodal healthcare data.</description>

      <title>Time Makes Space: Emergence of Place Fields in Networks Encoding Temporally Continuous Sensory Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.</description>

      <title>E2Map: Experience-and-Emotion Map for Self-Reflective Robot Navigation with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in guiding embodied agents to execute language instructions across a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and navigation. However, existing methods are primarily designed for static environments and do not leverage the agent's own experiences to refine its initial plans. Given that real-world environments are inherently stochastic, initial plans based solely on LLMs' general knowledge may fail to achieve their objectives, unlike in static scenarios. To address this limitation, this study introduces the Experience-and-Emotion Map (E2Map), which integrates not only LLM knowledge but also the agent's real-world experiences, drawing inspiration from human emotional responses. The proposed methodology enables one-shot behavior adjustments by updating the E2Map based on the agent's experiences. Our evaluation in stochastic navigation environments, including both simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances performance in stochastic environments compared to existing LLM-based approaches. Code and supplementary materials are available at https://e2map.github.io/.</description>

      <title>MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become more prevalent, the need for explainability grows-understanding how these systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models. Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the model's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music understanding systems.</description>

      <title>LLMs &amp; XAI for Water Sustainability: Seasonal Water Quality Prediction with LIME Explainable AI and a RAG-based Chatbot for Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safe water supplies requires effective water quality monitoring, especially in developing countries like Nepal, where contamination risks are high. This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning model to predict Nepal's seasonal water quality using a small dataset with multiple water quality parameters. Models such as CatBoost, XGBoost, Extra Trees, and LightGBM, along with a neural network combining CNN and RNN layers, are used to capture temporal and spatial patterns in the data. The model demonstrated notable accuracy improvements, aiding proactive water quality control. CatBoost, XGBoost, and Extra Trees Regressor predicted Water Quality Index (WQI) values with an average RMSE of 1.2 and an R2 score of 0.99. Additionally, classifiers achieved 99 percent accuracy, cross-validated across models. LIME analysis highlighted the importance of indicators like EC and DO levels in XGBoost classification decisions. The neural network model achieved 92 percent classification accuracy and an R2 score of 0.97, with an RMSE of 2.87 in regression analysis. Furthermore, a multifunctional application was developed to predict WQI values using both regression and classification methods.</description>

      <title>Remaining Useful Life Prediction for Batteries Utilizing an Explainable AI Approach with a Predictive Application for Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a battery is essential for determining its lifespan and recharge requirements. In this work, we develop machine learning-based models to predict and classify battery RUL. We introduce a two-level ensemble learning (TLE) framework and a CNN+MLP hybrid model for RUL prediction, comparing their performance against traditional, deep, and hybrid machine learning models. Our analysis evaluates various models for both prediction and classification while incorporating interpretability through SHAP. The proposed TLE model consistently outperforms baseline models in RMSE, MAE, and R squared error, demonstrating its superior predictive capabilities. Additionally, the XGBoost classifier achieves an impressive 99% classification accuracy, validated through cross-validation techniques. The models effectively predict relay-based charging triggers, enabling automated and energy-efficient charging processes. This automation reduces energy consumption and enhances battery performance by optimizing charging cycles. SHAP interpretability analysis highlights the cycle index and charging parameters as the most critical factors influencing RUL. To improve accessibility, we developed a Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to input new data and predict RUL in real time. This practical solution supports sustainable battery management by enabling data-driven decisions about battery usage and maintenance, contributing to energy-efficient and innovative battery life prediction.</description>

      <title>Safety challenges of AI in medicine in the era of large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs), have unlocked significant potential to enhance the quality and efficiency of medical care. By introducing a novel way to interact with AI and data through natural language, LLMs offer new opportunities for medical practitioners, patients, and researchers. However, as AI and LLMs become more powerful and especially achieve superhuman performance in some medical tasks, public concerns over their safety have intensified. These concerns about AI safety have emerged as the most significant obstacles to the adoption of AI in medicine. In response, this review examines emerging risks in AI utilization during the LLM era. First, we explore LLM-specific safety challenges from functional and communication perspectives, addressing issues across data collection, model training, and real-world application. We then consider inherent safety problems shared by all AI systems, along with additional complications introduced by LLMs. Last, we discussed how safety issues of using AI in clinical practice and healthcare system operation would undermine trust among patient, clinicians and the public, and how to build confidence in these systems. By emphasizing the development of safe AI, we believe these technologies can be more rapidly and reliably integrated into everyday medical practice to benefit both patients and clinicians.</description>

      <title>How Much Can We Forget about Data Contamination?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leakage of benchmark data into the training data has emerged as a significant challenge for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we challenge the common assumption that small-scale contamination renders benchmark evaluations invalid. First, we experimentally quantify the magnitude of benchmark overfitting based on scaling along three dimensions: The number of model parameters (up to 1.6B), the number of times an example is seen (up to 144), and the number of training tokens (up to 40B). If model and data follow the Chinchilla scaling laws, minor contamination indeed leads to overfitting. At the same time, even 144 times of contamination can be forgotten if the training data is scaled beyond five times Chinchilla, a regime characteristic of many modern LLMs. Continual pre-training of OLMo-7B corroborates these results. Next, we study the impact of the weight decay parameter on example forgetting, showing that empirical forgetting occurs faster than the cumulative weight decay. This allows us to gauge the degree of example forgetting in large-scale training runs, indicating that many LLMs, including Lllama 3 405B, have forgotten the data seen at the beginning of training.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Guidance for Local Training in Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL). In scenarios with diverse model architectures, directly aggregating model parameters is impractical, leading HtFL methods to incorporate an extra objective alongside the original local objective on each client to facilitate collaboration. However, this often results in a mismatch between the extra and local objectives. To resolve this, we propose Federated Learning-to-Guide (FedL2G), a method that adaptively learns to guide local training in a federated manner, ensuring the added objective aligns with each client's original goal. With theoretical guarantees, FedL2G utilizes only first-order derivatives w.r.t. model parameters, achieving a non-convex convergence rate of O(1/T). We conduct extensive experiments across two data heterogeneity and six model heterogeneity settings, using 14 heterogeneous model architectures (e.g., CNNs and ViTs). The results show that FedL2G significantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Role of Reasoning Structures for Constructing Proofs in Multi-Step Natural Language Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When performing complex multi-step reasoning tasks, the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive structured intermediate proof steps is important for ensuring that the models truly perform the desired reasoning and for improving models' explainability. This paper is centred around a focused study: whether the current state-of-the-art generalist LLMs can leverage the structures in a few examples to better construct the proof structures with \textit{in-context learning}. Our study specifically focuses on structure-aware demonstration and structure-aware pruning. We demonstrate that they both help improve performance. A detailed analysis is provided to help understand the results.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated Penetration Testing: Introducing LLM Benchmark, Analysis, and Improvements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hacking poses a significant threat to cybersecurity, inflicting billions of dollars in damages annually. To mitigate these risks, ethical hacking, or penetration testing, is employed to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential across various domains, including cybersecurity. However, there is currently no comprehensive, open, end-to-end automated penetration testing benchmark to drive progress and evaluate the capabilities of these models in security contexts. This paper introduces a novel open benchmark for LLM-based automated penetration testing, addressing this critical gap. We first evaluate the performance of LLMs, including GPT-4o and Llama 3.1-405B, using the state-of-the-art PentestGPT tool. Our findings reveal that while Llama 3.1 demonstrates an edge over GPT-4o, both models currently fall short of performing fully automated, end-to-end penetration testing. Next, we advance the state-of-the-art and present ablation studies that provide insights into improving the PentestGPT tool. Our research illuminates the challenges LLMs face in each aspect of Pentesting, e.g. enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI-assisted cybersecurity and lays the foundation for future research in automated penetration testing using large language models.</description>

      <title>R-LLaVA: Improving Med-VQA Understanding through Visual Region of Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), yet prevalent studies often interpret images holistically, overlooking the visual regions of interest that may contain crucial information, potentially aligning with a doctor's prior knowledge that can be incorporated with minimal annotations (e.g., bounding boxes). To address this gap, this paper introduces R-LLaVA, designed to enhance biomedical VQA understanding by integrating simple medical annotations as prior knowledge directly into the image space through CLIP. These annotated visual regions of interest are then fed into the LLaVA model during training, aiming to enrich the model's understanding of biomedical queries. Experimental evaluation on four standard Med-VQA datasets demonstrates R-LLaVA's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. Additionally, to verify the model's capability in visual comprehension, a novel multiple-choice medical visual understanding dataset is introduced, confirming the positive impact of focusing on visual regions of interest in advancing biomedical VQA understanding.</description>

      <title>CURATe: Benchmarking Personalised Alignment of Conversational AI Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-turn benchmark for evaluating personalised alignment in LLM-based AI assistants, focusing on their ability to handle user-provided safety-critical contexts. Our assessment of ten leading models across five scenarios (with 337 use cases each) reveals systematic inconsistencies in maintaining user-specific consideration, with even top-rated "harmless" models making recommendations that should be recognised as obviously harmful to the user given the context provided. Key failure modes include inappropriate weighing of conflicting preferences, sycophancy (prioritising desires above safety), a lack of attentiveness to critical user information within the context window, and inconsistent application of user-specific knowledge. The same systematic biases were observed in OpenAI's o1, suggesting that strong reasoning capacities do not necessarily transfer to this kind of personalised thinking. We find that prompting LLMs to consider safety-critical context significantly improves performance, unlike a generic 'harmless and helpful' instruction. Based on these findings, we propose research directions for embedding self-reflection capabilities, online user modelling, and dynamic risk assessment in AI assistants. Our work emphasises the need for nuanced, context-aware approaches to alignment in systems designed for persistent human interaction, aiding the development of safe and considerate AI assistants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision. However, their performance in multivariate long-term forecasting often falls short compared to simpler linear baselines. Previous research has identified the traditional attention mechanism as a key factor limiting their effectiveness in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce LATST, a novel approach designed to mitigate entropy collapse and training instability common challenges in Transformer-based time series forecasting. We rigorously evaluate LATST across multiple real-world multivariate time series datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform existing state-of-the-art Transformer models. Notably, LATST manages to achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters than some linear models on certain datasets, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Prospective Learning: Learning for a Dynamic Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, the distribution of the data, and our goals, evolve over time. The prevailing theoretical framework for studying machine learning, namely probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, largely ignores time. As a consequence, existing strategies to address the dynamic nature of data and goals exhibit poor real-world performance. This paper develops a theoretical framework called "Prospective Learning" that is tailored for situations when the optimal hypothesis changes over time. In PAC learning, empirical risk minimization (ERM) is known to be consistent. We develop a learner called Prospective ERM, which returns a sequence of predictors that make predictions on future data. We prove that the risk of prospective ERM converges to the Bayes risk under certain assumptions on the stochastic process generating the data. Prospective ERM, roughly speaking, incorporates time as an input in addition to the data. We show that standard ERM as done in PAC learning, without incorporating time, can result in failure to learn when distributions are dynamic. Numerical experiments illustrate that prospective ERM can learn synthetic and visual recognition problems constructed from MNIST and CIFAR-10.

      <title>Zeroth-Order Adaptive Neuron Alignment Based Pruning without Re-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network pruning focuses on computational techniques that aim to reduce a given model's computational cost by removing a subset of its parameters while having minimal impact on performance. Throughout the last decade, the most widely used pruning paradigm has been pruning and re-training, which nowadays is inconvenient due to the vast amount of pre-trained models, which are in any case too expensive to re-train. In this paper, we exploit functional information from dense pre-trained models, i.e., their activations, to obtain sparse models that maximize the activations' alignment w.r.t. their corresponding dense models. Hence, we propose \textsc{NeuroAL}, a \emph{top-up} algorithm that can be used on top of any given pruning algorithm for LLMs, which modifies the block-wise and row-wise sparsity exploiting information from both the dense model and its sparse version to maximize the \emph{neuron alignment} among activations. Differently from existing methods, our approach adaptively selects the best hyperparameters for the block-wise and row-wise sparsity ratios w.r.t. the model and the desired sparsity, and requires \emph{no re-training}. We test our method over 276 cases combining four LLM families, three sparsity ratios, and ten language tasks (three language modeling and seven zero-shot datasets), showing how it consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance-runtime trade-off.

      <title>Bounded Rationality Equilibrium Learning in Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) tractably model behavior in large agent populations. The literature on learning MFG equilibria typically focuses on finding Nash equilibria (NE), which assume perfectly rational agents and are hence implausible in many realistic situations. To overcome these limitations, we incorporate bounded rationality into MFGs by leveraging the well-known concept of quantal response equilibria (QRE). Two novel types of MFG QRE enable the modeling of large agent populations where individuals only noisily estimate the true objective. We also introduce a second source of bounded rationality to MFGs by restricting agents' planning horizon. The resulting novel receding horizon (RH) MFGs are combined with QRE and existing approaches to model different aspects of bounded rationality in MFGs. We formally define MFG QRE and RH MFGs and compare them to existing equilibrium concepts such as entropy-regularized NE. Subsequently, we design generalized fixed point iteration and fictitious play algorithms to learn QRE and RH equilibria. After a theoretical analysis, we give different examples to evaluate the capabilities of our learning algorithms and outline practical differences between the equilibrium concepts.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel attention mechanism, named Cog Attention, that enables attention weights to be negative for enhanced expressiveness, which stems from two key factors: (1) Cog Attention enhances parameter flexibility. For example, unlike traditional softmax attention heads that use a static output-value (OV) matrix to delete or copy inputs that the heads attend to, Cog Attention naturally learns to use the sign of dynamic query-key (QK) inner products to represent these operations. This enables Cog Attention to perform multiple operations simultaneously within a single head. Meanwhile, Cog Attention's OV matrix can focus more on refinement or modification. (2) Cog Attention enhances the model's robustness against representational collapse by preventing the ``over-squashing'' of earlier tokens into later positions. We develop Transformer-like models which use Cog Attention as attention modules, including decoder-only models at various scales for language modeling and U-ViT diffusion models for image generation. Experiments show that models using Cog Attention exhibit superior performance compared to those employing traditional softmax attention modules. Our approach suggests a promising research direction for rethinking and breaking the entrenched constraints of traditional softmax attention, such as the requirement for non-negative weights.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Sampling for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging because the size of the joint state and action spaces grows exponentially in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm $\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}$ ($\textbf{Subsample}$-$\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield-$\textbf{Q}$-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For $k\leq n$, our algorithm learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We show that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy on the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. We empirically validate our method in Gaussian squeeze and global exploration settings.</description>

      <title>Automated Test-Case Generation for REST APIs Using Model Inference Search Heuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rising popularity of the microservice architectural style has led to a growing demand for automated testing approaches tailored to these systems. EvoMaster is a state-of-the-art tool that uses Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to automatically generate test cases for microservices' REST APIs. One limitation of these EAs is the use of unit-level search heuristics, such as branch distances, which focus on fine-grained code coverage and may not effectively capture the complex, interconnected behaviors characteristic of system-level testing. To address this limitation, we propose a new search heuristic (MISH) that uses real-time automaton learning to guide the test case generation process. We capture the sequential call patterns exhibited by a test case by learning an automaton from the stream of log events outputted by different microservices within the same system. Therefore, MISH learns a representation of the systemwide behavior, allowing us to define the fitness of a test case based on the path it traverses within the inferred automaton. We empirically evaluate MISH's effectiveness on six real-world benchmark microservice applications and compare it against a state-of-the-art technique, MOSA, for testing REST APIs. Our evaluation shows promising results for using MISH to guide the automated test case generation within EvoMaster.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-driven conservative-to-primitive conversion in hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel machine learning (ML) method to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion, focusing on hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state. Traditional root-finding techniques are computationally expensive, particularly for large-scale relativistic hydrodynamics simulations. To address this, we employ feedforward neural networks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU inference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss. The NNC2PS model achieves $ L_1 $ and $ L_\infty $ errors of $ 4.54 \times 10^{-7} $ and $ 3.44 \times 10^{-6} $, respectively, while the NNC2PL model exhibits even lower error values. TensorRT optimization with mixed-precision deployment substantially accelerates performance compared to traditional root-finding methods. Specifically, the mixed-precision TensorRT engine for NNC2PS achieves inference speeds approximately 400 times faster than a traditional single-threaded CPU implementation for a dataset size of 1,000,000 points. Ideal parallelization across an entire compute node in the Delta supercomputer (Dual AMD 64 core 2.45 GHz Milan processors; and 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40 GB HBM2 RAM and NVLink) predicts a 25-fold speedup for TensorRT over an optimally-parallelized numerical method when processing 8 million data points. Moreover, the ML method exhibits sub-linear scaling with increasing dataset sizes. We release the scientific software developed, enabling further validation and extension of our findings. This work underscores the potential of ML, combined with GPU optimization and model quantization, to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion in relativistic hydrodynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Flow Is All You Need to Sample Out-of-Distribution Chemical Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating novel molecules with higher properties than the training space, namely the out-of-distribution generation, is important for ${de~novo}$ drug design. However, it is not easy for distribution learning-based models, for example diffusion models, to solve this challenge as these methods are designed to fit the distribution of training data as close as possible. In this paper, we show that Bayesian flow network is capable of effortlessly generating high quality out-of-distribution samples that meet several scenarios. We introduce a semi-autoregressive training/sampling method that helps to enhance the model performance and surpass the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>PixelMan: Consistent Object Editing with Diffusion Models via Pixel Manipulation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research explores the potential of Diffusion Models (DMs) for consistent object editing, which aims to modify object position, size, and composition, etc., while preserving the consistency of objects and background without changing their texture and attributes. Current inference-time methods often rely on DDIM inversion, which inherently compromises efficiency and the achievable consistency of edited images. Recent methods also utilize energy guidance which iteratively updates the predicted noise and can drive the latents away from the original image, resulting in distortions. In this paper, we propose PixelMan, an inversion-free and training-free method for achieving consistent object editing via Pixel Manipulation and generation, where we directly create a duplicate copy of the source object at target location in the pixel space, and introduce an efficient sampling approach to iteratively harmonize the manipulated object into the target location and inpaint its original location, while ensuring image consistency by anchoring the edited image to be generated to the pixel-manipulated image as well as by introducing various consistency-preserving optimization techniques during inference. Experimental evaluations based on benchmark datasets as well as extensive visual comparisons show that in as few as 16 inference steps, PixelMan outperforms a range of state-of-the-art training-based and training-free methods (usually requiring 50 steps) on multiple consistent object editing tasks.</description>

      <title>LMFusion: Adapting Pretrained Language Models for Multimodal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LMFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences. LMFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.</description>

      <title>The Meta-Representation Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans rely on high-level understandings of things, i.e., meta-representations, to engage in abstract reasoning. In complex cognitive tasks, these meta-representations help individuals abstract general rules from experience. However, constructing such meta-representations from high-dimensional observations remains a longstanding challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. For instance, a well-trained agent often fails to generalize to even minor variations of the same task, such as changes in background color, while humans can easily handle. In this paper, we theoretically investigate how meta-representations contribute to the generalization ability of RL agents, demonstrating that learning meta-representations from high-dimensional observations enhance an agent's ability to generalize across varied environments. We further hypothesize that deep mutual learning (DML) among agents can help them learn the meta-representations that capture the underlying essence of the task. Empirical results provide strong support for both our theory and hypothesis. Overall, this work provides a new perspective on the generalization of deep reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the impact of single-point amino acid mutations on protein stability is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and advancing drug development. Protein stability, quantified by changes in Gibbs free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$), is influenced by these mutations. However, the scarcity of data and the complexity of model interpretation pose challenges in accurately predicting stability changes. This study proposes the application of deep neural networks, leveraging transfer learning and fusing complementary information from different models, to create a feature-rich representation of the protein stability landscape. We developed four models, with our third model, ThermoMPNN+, demonstrating the best performance in predicting $\Delta\Delta G$ values. This approach, which integrates diverse feature sets and embeddings through latent transfusion techniques, aims to refine $\Delta\Delta G$ predictions and contribute to a deeper understanding of protein dynamics, potentially leading to advancements in disease research and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Decision-Making for Digital Twin in Additive Manufacturing with Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital Twin-a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making-combined with recent advances in machine learning (ML), offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multi-variate deep neural network (DNN), named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Different from the models in conventional MPC which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10%-30%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to the PID controller, MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</description>

      <title>SLIM: Sim-to-Real Legged Instructive Manipulation via Long-Horizon Visuomotor Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a low-cost legged mobile manipulation system that solves long-horizon real-world tasks, trained by reinforcement learning purely in simulation. This system is made possible by 1) a hierarchical design of a high-level policy for visual-mobile manipulation following task instructions, and a low-level quadruped locomotion policy, 2) a teacher and student training pipeline for the high level, which trains a teacher to tackle long-horizon tasks using privileged task decomposition and target object information, and further trains a student for visual-mobile manipulation via RL guided by the teacher's behavior, and 3) a suite of techniques for minimizing the sim-to-real gap.
  In contrast to many previous works that use high-end equipments, our system demonstrates effective performance with more accessible hardware -- specifically, a Unitree Go1 quadruped, a WidowX-250S arm, and a single wrist-mounted RGB camera -- despite the increased challenges of sim-to-real transfer. Trained fully in simulation, a single policy autonomously solves long-horizon tasks involving search, move to, grasp, transport, and drop into, achieving nearly 80% real-world success. This performance is comparable to that of expert human teleoperation on the same tasks while the robot is more efficient, operating at about 1.5x the speed of the teleoperation. Finally, we perform extensive ablations on key techniques for efficient RL training and effective sim-to-real transfer, and demonstrate effective deployment across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes under various lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>Adapting Beyond the Depth Limit: Counter Strategies in Large Imperfect Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of adapting to a known sub-rational opponent during online play while remaining robust to rational opponents. We focus on large imperfect-information (zero-sum) games, which makes it impossible to inspect the whole game tree at once and necessitates the use of depth-limited search. However, all existing methods assume rational play beyond the depth-limit, which only allows them to adapt a very limited portion of the opponent's behaviour. We propose an algorithm Adapting Beyond Depth-limit (ABD) that uses a strategy-portfolio approach - which we refer to as matrix-valued states - for depth-limited search. This allows the algorithm to fully utilise all information about the opponent model, making it the first robust-adaptation method to be able to do so in large imperfect-information games. As an additional benefit, the use of matrix-valued states makes the algorithm simpler than traditional methods based on optimal value functions. Our experimental results in poker and battleship show that ABD yields more than a twofold increase in utility when facing opponents who make mistakes beyond the depth limit and also delivers significant improvements in utility and safety against randomly generated opponents.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</description>

      <title>EvidenceMap: Learning Evidence Analysis to Unleash the Power of Small Language Models for Biomedical Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When addressing professional questions in the biomedical domain, humans typically acquire multiple pieces of information as evidence and engage in multifaceted evidence analysis to provide high-quality answers. Current LLM-based answer generation methods lack a detailed definition and learning process for evidence analysis, leading to the risk of error propagation and hallucinations while using evidence. Although increasing the parameter size of LLMs can alleviate these issues, it also presents challenges in model training and deployment with limited resources. In this study, we propose EvidenceMap, which aims to enable a tiny pre-trained language model to explicitly learn multiple aspects of biomedical evidence, including supportive evaluation, logical correlation and content summarization, thereby latently guiding a small generative model (around 3B parameters) to provide textual responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, fine-tuning a language model with 66M parameters, exceeds the RAG method with an 8B LLM by 19.9% and 5.7% in reference-based quality and accuracy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Temporal Preference Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

      <title>Advancing the Understanding and Evaluation of AR-Generated Scenes: When Vision-Language Models Shine and Stumble</title>

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enhances the real world by integrating virtual content, yet ensuring the quality, usability, and safety of AR experiences presents significant challenges. Could Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a solution for the automated evaluation of AR-generated scenes? Could Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a solution for the automated evaluation of AR-generated scenes? In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of three state-of-the-art commercial VLMs -- GPT, Gemini, and Claude -- in identifying and describing AR scenes. For this purpose, we use DiverseAR, the first AR dataset specifically designed to assess VLMs' ability to analyze virtual content across a wide range of AR scene complexities. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are generally capable of perceiving and describing AR scenes, achieving a True Positive Rate (TPR) of up to 93% for perception and 71% for description. While they excel at identifying obvious virtual objects, such as a glowing apple, they struggle when faced with seamlessly integrated content, such as a virtual pot with realistic shadows. Our results highlight both the strengths and the limitations of VLMs in understanding AR scenarios. We identify key factors affecting VLM performance, including virtual content placement, rendering quality, and physical plausibility. This study underscores the potential of VLMs as tools for evaluating the quality of AR experiences.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Time-Aware Mixture of Experts for Multi-Modal Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal sequential recommendation (SR) leverages multi-modal data to learn more comprehensive item features and user preferences than traditional SR methods, which has become a critical topic in both academia and industry. Existing methods typically focus on enhancing multi-modal information utility through adaptive modality fusion to capture the evolving of user preference from user-item interaction sequences. However, most of them overlook the interference caused by redundant interest-irrelevant information contained in rich multi-modal data. Additionally, they primarily rely on implicit temporal information based solely on chronological ordering, neglecting explicit temporal signals that could more effectively represent dynamic user interest over time. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical time-aware Mixture of experts for multi-modal Sequential Recommendation (HM4SR) with a two-level Mixture of Experts (MoE) and a multi-task learning strategy. Specifically, the first MoE, named Interactive MoE, extracts essential user interest-related information from the multi-modal data of each item. Then, the second MoE, termed Temporal MoE, captures user dynamic interests by introducing explicit temporal embeddings from timestamps in modality encoding. To further address data sparsity, we propose three auxiliary supervision tasks: sequence-level category prediction (CP) for item feature understanding, contrastive learning on ID (IDCL) to align sequence context with user interests, and placeholder contrastive learning (PCL) to integrate temporal information with modalities for dynamic interest modeling. Extensive experiments on four public datasets verify the effectiveness of HM4SR compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>An Attentive Graph Agent for Topology-Adaptive Cyber Defence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a promising technique to create intelligent and adaptive cyber defense systems. However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information and constraining their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment, encoding network state as a directed graph with realistic low-level features. We employ a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and adapt its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in RL. Our GAT-based approach offers key advantages over flattened alternatives: robust policies capable of handling dynamic network topology changes, generalisation to networks of varying sizes beyond the training distribution, and interpretable defensive actions grounded in tangible network properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our low-level directed graph observations by training GAT defensive policies that successfully adapt to changing network topologies. Evaluations across networks of different sizes, but consistent subnetwork structure, show our policies achieve comparable performance to policies trained specifically for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.</description>

      <title>Return of the Encoder: Maximizing Parameter Efficiency for SLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dominance of large decoder-only language models has overshadowed encoder-decoder architectures, despite their fundamental efficiency advantages in sequence processing. For small language models (SLMs) - those with 1 billion parameters or fewer - our systematic analysis across GPU, CPU, and NPU platforms reveals that encoder-decoder architectures achieve 47% lower first-token latency and 4.7x higher throughput compared to decoder-only models on edge devices. These gains may be attributed to encoder-decoder's one-time input processing and efficient separation of understanding and generation phases.
  We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables encoder-decoder models to leverage capabilities from large scalable decoder-only teachers while preserving their architectural advantages, achieving up to 6 average performance points improvement across diverse tasks, with significant gains in asymmetric sequence tasks where input and output distributions can benefit from different processing approaches.
  When combined with modern advances like Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and Vision encoders, our systematic investigation demonstrates that encoder-decoder architectures provide a more practical path toward deploying capable language models in resource-constrained environments. Our findings challenge the prevailing trend toward decoder-only scaling, showing that architectural choices become increasingly crucial as parameter budgets decrease, particularly for on-device and edge deployments where computational efficiency is paramount.</description>

      <title>Towards Resource-Efficient Compound AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compound AI Systems, integrating multiple interacting components like models, retrievers, and external tools, have emerged as essential for addressing complex AI tasks. However, current implementations suffer from inefficient resource utilization due to tight coupling between application logic and execution details, a disconnect between orchestration and resource management layers, and the perceived exclusiveness between efficiency and quality.
  We propose a vision for resource-efficient Compound AI Systems through a declarative workflow programming model and an adaptive runtime system for dynamic scheduling and resource-aware decision-making. Decoupling application logic from low-level details exposes levers for the runtime to flexibly configure the execution environment and resources, without compromising on quality. Enabling collaboration between the workflow orchestration and cluster manager enables higher efficiency through better scheduling and resource management.
  We are building a prototype system, called Murakkab, to realize this vision. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates speedups up to $\sim 3.4\times$ in workflow completion times while delivering $\sim 4.5\times$ higher energy efficiency, showing promise in optimizing resources and advancing AI system design.</description>

      <title>Vision-based autonomous structural damage detection using data-driven methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the urgent need for efficient and accurate damage detection in wind turbine structures, a crucial component of renewable energy infrastructure. Traditional inspection methods, such as manual assessments and non-destructive testing (NDT), are often costly, time-consuming, and prone to human error. To tackle these challenges, this research investigates advanced deep learning algorithms for vision-based structural health monitoring (SHM). A dataset of wind turbine surface images, featuring various damage types and pollution, was prepared and augmented for enhanced model training. Three algorithms-YOLOv7, its lightweight variant, and Faster R-CNN- were employed to detect and classify surface damage. The models were trained and evaluated on a dataset split into training, testing, and evaluation subsets (80%-10%-10%). Results indicate that YOLOv7 outperformed the others, achieving 82.4% mAP@50 and high processing speed, making it suitable for real-time inspections. By optimizing hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size, the models' accuracy and efficiency improved further. YOLOv7 demonstrated significant advancements in detection precision and execution speed, especially for real-time applications. However, challenges such as dataset limitations and environmental variability were noted, suggesting future work on segmentation methods and larger datasets. This research underscores the potential of vision-based deep learning techniques to transform SHM practices by reducing costs, enhancing safety, and improving reliability, thus contributing to the sustainable maintenance of critical infrastructure and supporting the longevity of wind energy systems.</description>

      <title>EvoGP: A GPU-accelerated Framework for Tree-Based Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a key evolutionary algorithm widely used in symbolic regression, feature engineering, and scientific modeling. Its high computational demands make GPU acceleration essential for scalable and high-performance evolutionary computation. However, GPU acceleration of TGP faces three key challenges: inefficient tree encoding, highly heterogeneous genetic operations, and limited parallelism in fitness evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce EvoGP, a comprehensive GPU-accelerated TGP framework. First, we design a tensorized encoding scheme to represent tree with different structures as tensors with the same shape, optimizing memory access and enabling efficient parallel execution. Second, we propose a unified parallel framework for genetic operations by leveraging shared computational primitives and implementing dedicated CUDA kernels for scalable performance. Third, we present a fully parallel fitness evaluation strategy for symbolic regression, exploiting both population-level and data-level parallelism to maximize GPU utilization. Moreover, we implement a comprehensive library to provide rich algorithm operators and benchmark problems. EvoGP is extensively tested on various tasks, including symbolic regression, classification, and robotics control, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse application scenarios. Experimental results show that EvoGP achieves up to a 140.89x speedup over the state-of-the-art GPU-based TGP implementation, while maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of baseline methods. EvoGP is open-source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.</description>

      <title>Multi-Physics Simulations via Coupled Fourier Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical simulations are essential tools across critical fields such as mechanical and aerospace engineering, chemistry, meteorology, etc. While neural operators, particularly the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have shown promise in predicting simulation results with impressive performance and efficiency, they face limitations when handling real-world scenarios involving coupled multi-physics outputs. Current neural operator methods either overlook the correlations between multiple physical processes or employ simplistic architectures that inadequately capture these relationships. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel coupled multi-physics neural operator learning (COMPOL) framework that extends the capabilities of Fourier operator layers to model interactions among multiple physical processes. Our approach implements feature aggregation through recurrent and attention mechanisms, enabling comprehensive modeling of coupled interactions. Our method's core is an innovative system for aggregating latent features from multi-physics processes. These aggregated features serve as enriched information sources for neural operator layers, allowing our framework to capture complex physical relationships accurately. We evaluated our coupled multi-physics neural operator across diverse physical simulation tasks, including biological systems, fluid mechanics, and multiphase flow in porous media. Our proposed model demonstrates a two to three-fold improvement in predictive performance compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>In-Context Meta LoRA Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities for task specific fine-tuning. However, in scenarios that involve multiple tasks, training a separate LoRA model for each one results in considerable inefficiency in terms of storage and inference. Moreover, existing parameter generation methods fail to capture the correlations among these tasks, making multi-task LoRA parameter generation challenging. To address these limitations, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), a novel approach that efficiently achieves task-specific customization of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we use training data from all tasks to train a tailored generator, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). CVAE takes task descriptions as inputs and produces task-aware LoRA weights as outputs. These LoRA weights are then merged with LLMs to create task-specialized models without the need for additional fine-tuning. Furthermore, we utilize in-context meta-learning for knowledge enhancement and task mapping, to capture the relationship between tasks and parameter distributions. As a result, our method achieves more accurate LoRA parameter generation for diverse tasks using CVAE. ICM-LoRA enables more accurate LoRA parameter reconstruction than current parameter reconstruction methods and is useful for implementing task-specific enhancements of LoRA parameters. At the same time, our method occupies 283MB, only 1\% storage compared with the original LoRA.</description>

      <title>ContourFormer:Real-Time Contour-Based End-to-End Instance Segmentation Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Contourformer, a real-time contour-based instance segmentation algorithm. The method is fully based on the DETR paradigm and achieves end-to-end inference through iterative and progressive mechanisms to optimize contours. To improve efficiency and accuracy, we develop two novel techniques: sub-contour decoupling mechanisms and contour fine-grained distribution refinement. In the sub-contour decoupling mechanism, we propose a deformable attention-based module that adaptively selects sampling regions based on the current predicted contour, enabling more effective capturing of object boundary information. Additionally, we design a multi-stage optimization process to enhance segmentation precision by progressively refining sub-contours. The contour fine-grained distribution refinement technique aims to further improve the ability to express fine details of contours. These innovations enable Contourformer to achieve stable and precise segmentation for each instance while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Contourformer on multiple benchmark datasets, including SBD, COCO, and KINS. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and inference speed. This work provides a new solution for contour-based instance segmentation tasks and lays a foundation for future research, with the potential to become a strong baseline method in this field.</description>
