      <title>MMCAformer: Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer for Traffic Speed Prediction with Microscopic Connected Vehicle Driving Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate speed prediction is crucial for proactive traffic management to enhance traffic efficiency and safety. Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features. Such improvements are more pronounced under congested, low-speed traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>A Few-Shot LLM Framework for Extreme Day Classification in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a few-shot classification framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict whether the next day will have spikes in real-time electricity prices. The approach aggregates system state information, including electricity demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, and recent electricity prices, into a set of statistical features that are formatted as natural-language prompts and fed to an LLM along with general instructions. The model then determines the likelihood that the next day would be a spike day and reports a confidence score. Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a data-efficient tool for classifying electricity price spikes in settings with scarce data.</description>

      <title>Real-time Secondary Crash Likelihood Prediction Excluding Post Primary Crash Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary crash likelihood prediction is a critical component of an active traffic management system to mitigate congestion and adverse impacts caused by secondary crashes. However, existing approaches mainly rely on post-crash features (e.g., crash type and severity) that are rarely available in real time, limiting their practical applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid secondary crash likelihood prediction framework that does not depend on post-crash features. A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models. Experiments on Florida freeways demonstrate that the proposed hybrid framework correctly identifies 91% of secondary crashes with a low false alarm rate of 0.20. The Area Under the ROC Curve improves from 0.654, 0.744, and 0.902 for the individual models to 0.952 for the hybrid model, outperforming previous studies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying LLM Attention-Head Stability: Implications for Circuit Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mechanistic interpretability, recent work scrutinizes transformer "circuits" - sparse, mono or multi layer sub computations, that may reflect human understandable functions. Yet, these network circuits are rarely acid-tested for their stability across different instances of the same deep learning architecture. Without this, it remains unclear whether reported circuits emerge universally across labs or turn out to be idiosyncratic to a particular estimation instance, potentially limiting confidence in safety-critical settings. Here, we systematically study stability across-refits in increasingly complex transformer language models of various sizes. We quantify, layer by layer, how similarly attention heads learn representations across independently initialized training runs. Our rigorous experiments show that (1) middle-layer heads are the least stable yet the most representationally distinct; (2) deeper models exhibit stronger mid-depth divergence; (3) unstable heads in deeper layers become more functionally important than their peers from the same layer; (4) applying weight decay optimization substantially improves attention-head stability across random model initializations; and (5) the residual stream is comparatively stable. Our findings establish the cross-instance robustness of circuits as an essential yet underappreciated prerequisite for scalable oversight, drawing contours around possible white-box monitorability of AI systems.</description>

      <title>DeepVision-103K: A Visually Diverse, Broad-Coverage, and Verifiable Mathematical Dataset for Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been shown effective in enhancing the visual reflection and reasoning capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, existing datasets are predominantly derived from either small-scale manual construction or recombination of prior resources, which limits data diversity and coverage, thereby constraining further gains in model performance. To this end, we introduce \textbf{DeepVision-103K}, a comprehensive dataset for RLVR training that covers diverse K12 mathematical topics, extensive knowledge points, and rich visual elements. Models trained on DeepVision achieve strong performance on multimodal mathematical benchmarks, and generalize effectively to general multimodal reasoning tasks. Further analysis reveals enhanced visual perception, reflection and reasoning capabilities in trained models, validating DeepVision's effectiveness for advancing multimodal reasoning.

      <title>PETS: A Principled Framework Towards Optimal Trajectory Allocation for Efficient Test-Time Self-Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling can improve model performance by aggregating stochastic reasoning trajectories. However, achieving sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under a limited budget remains an open challenge. We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

      <title>Low-Dimensional and Transversely Curved Optimization Dynamics in Grokking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grokking -- the delayed transition from memorization to generalization in small algorithmic tasks -- remains poorly understood. We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect.</description>

      <title>LiveClin: A Live Clinical Benchmark without Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of medical LLM evaluation is critically undermined by data contamination and knowledge obsolescence, leading to inflated scores on static benchmarks. To address these challenges, we introduce LiveClin, a live benchmark designed for approximating real-world clinical practice. Built from contemporary, peer-reviewed case reports and updated biannually, LiveClin ensures clinical currency and resists data contamination. Using a verified AI-human workflow involving 239 physicians, we transform authentic patient cases into complex, multimodal evaluation scenarios that span the entire clinical pathway. The benchmark currently comprises 1,407 case reports and 6,605 questions. Our evaluation of 26 models on LiveClin reveals the profound difficulty of these real-world scenarios, with the top-performing model achieving a Case Accuracy of just 35.7%. In benchmarking against human experts, Chief Physicians achieved the highest accuracy, followed closely by Attending Physicians, with both surpassing most models. LiveClin thus provides a continuously evolving, clinically grounded framework to guide the development of medical LLMs towards closing this gap and achieving greater reliability and real-world utility. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/AQ-MedAI/LiveClin.</description>

      <title>Attending to Routers Aids Indoor Wireless Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning-based wireless localization using Wi-Fi signals continues to face significant challenges in achieving groundbreaking performance across diverse environments. A major limitation is that most existing algorithms do not appropriately weight the information from different routers during aggregation, resulting in suboptimal convergence and reduced accuracy. Motivated by traditional weighted triangulation methods, this paper introduces the concept of attention to routers, ensuring that each router's contribution is weighted differently when aggregating information from multiple routers for triangulation. We demonstrate, by incorporating attention layers into a standard machine learning localization architecture, that emphasizing the relevance of each router can substantially improve overall performance. We have also shown through evaluation over the open-sourced datasets and demonstrate that Attention to Routers outperforms the benchmark architecture by over 30% in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Argument of Latitude Error Model for LEO Satellite Orbit and Covariance Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are leveraged to support new position, navigation, and timing (PNT) service alternatives to GNSS. These alternatives require accurate propagation of satellite position and velocity with a realistic quantification of uncertainty. It is commonly assumed that the propagated uncertainty distribution is Gaussian; however, the validity of this assumption can be quickly compromised by the mismodeling of atmospheric drag. We develop a machine learning approach that corrects error growth in the argument of latitude for a diverse set of LEO satellites. The improved orbit propagation accuracy extends the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and modeling of the errors with a corrected mean and covariance. We compare the performance of a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process on datasets computed with an open source orbit propagator and publicly available Vector Covariance Message (VCM) ephemerides. The learned models predict the argument of latitude error as a Gaussian distribution given parameters from a single VCM epoch and reverse propagation errors. We show that this one-dimensional model captures the effect of mismodeled drag, which can be mapped to the Cartesian state space. The correction method only updates information along the dimensions of dominant error growth, while maintaining the physics-based propagation of VCM covariance in the remaining dimensions. We therefore extend the utility of VCM ephemerides to longer time horizons without modifying the functionality of the existing propagator.</description>

      <title>Omitted Variable Bias in Language Models Under Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, modern language models remain susceptible to distribution shifts, exhibiting brittle behavior when evaluated on data that differs in distribution from their training data. In this paper, we describe how distribution shifts in language models can be separated into observable and unobservable components, and we discuss how established approaches for dealing with distribution shift address only the former. Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift. In empirical experiments, we show that using these bounds directly in language model evaluation and optimization provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true out-of-distribution performance relative to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and further enables inference about the strength of the omitted variables when target distribution labels are available.</description>

      <title>Better Think Thrice: Learning to Reason Causally with Double Counterfactual Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning benchmarks, large language models (LLMs) have proven brittle when presented with counterfactual questions, suggesting weaknesses in their causal reasoning ability. While recent work has demonstrated that labeled counterfactual tasks can be useful benchmarks of LLMs' causal reasoning, producing such data at the scale required to cover the vast potential space of counterfactuals is limited. In this work, we introduce double counterfactual consistency (DCC), a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and guiding the ability of LLMs to reason causally. Without requiring labeled counterfactual data, DCC verifies a model's ability to execute two important elements of causal reasoning: causal intervention and counterfactual prediction. Using DCC, we evaluate the causal reasoning abilities of various leading LLMs across a range of reasoning tasks and interventions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DCC as a training-free test-time rejection sampling criterion and show that it can directly improve performance on reasoning tasks across multiple model families.</description>

      <title>Escaping the Cognitive Well: Efficient Competition Math with Off-the-Shelf Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past year, custom and unreleased math reasoning models reached gold medal performance on the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Similar performance was then reported using large-scale inference on publicly available models but at prohibitive costs (e.g., 3000 USD per problem). In this work, we present an inference pipeline that attains best-in-class performance on IMO-style math problems at an average inference cost orders of magnitude below competing methods while using only general-purpose off-the-shelf models. Our method relies on insights about grader failure in solver-grader pipelines, which we call the Cognitive Well (iterative refinement converging to a wrong solution that the solver as well as the pipeline's internal grader consider to be basically correct). Our pipeline addresses these failure modes through conjecture extraction, wherein candidate lemmas are isolated from generated solutions and independently verified alongside their negations in a fresh environment (context detachment). On IMO-ProofBench Advanced (PB-Adv), our pipeline achieves 67.1 percent performance using Gemini 3.0 Pro with an average cost per question of approximately 31 USD. At the time of evaluation, this represented the state-of-the-art on PB-Adv among both public and unreleased models, and more than doubles the success rate of the next best publicly accessible pipeline, all at a fraction of the cost.</description>

      <title>Efficient Tail-Aware Generative Optimization via Flow Model Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion and flow models to optimize downstream utilities is central to real-world deployment. Existing entropy-regularized methods primarily maximize expected reward, providing no mechanism to shape tail behavior. However, tail control is often essential: the lower tail determines reliability by limiting low-reward failures, while the upper tail enables discovery by prioritizing rare, high-reward outcomes. In this work, we present Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT), a principled and efficient distributional fine-tuning algorithm based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We address two distinct tail-shaping goals: right-CVaR for seeking novel samples in the high-reward tail and left-CVaR for controlling worst-case samples in the low-reward tail. Unlike prior approaches that rely on non-linear optimization, we leverage the variational dual formulation of CVaR to decompose it into a decoupled two-stage procedure: a lightweight one-dimensional threshold optimization step, and a single entropy-regularized fine-tuning process via a specific pseudo-reward. This decomposition achieves CVaR fine-tuning efficiently with computational cost comparable to standard expected fine-tuning methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TFFT across illustrative experiments, high-dimensional text-to-image generation, and molecular design.</description>

      <title>TopoFlow: Physics-guided Neural Networks for high-resolution air quality prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose TopoFlow (Topography-aware pollutant Flow learning), a physics-guided neural network for efficient, high-resolution air quality prediction. To explicitly embed physical processes into the learning framework, we identify two critical factors governing pollutant dynamics: topography and wind direction. Complex terrain can channel, block, and trap pollutants, while wind acts as a primary driver of their transport and dispersion. Building on these insights, TopoFlow leverages a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: topography-aware attention, which explicitly models terrain-induced flow patterns, and wind-guided patch reordering, which aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. Trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data assimilating observations from over 1,400 surface monitoring stations across China, TopoFlow achieves a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, representing a 71-80% improvement over operational forecasting systems and a 13% improvement over state-of-the-art AI baselines. Forecast errors remain well below China's 24-hour air quality threshold of 75 ug/m3 (GB 3095-2012), enabling reliable discrimination between clean and polluted conditions. These performance gains are consistent across all four major pollutants and forecast lead times from 12 to 96 hours, demonstrating that principled integration of physical knowledge into neural networks can fundamentally advance air quality prediction.</description>

      <title>Formal Mechanistic Interpretability: Automated Circuit Discovery with Provable Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: *Automated circuit discovery* is a central tool in mechanistic interpretability for identifying the internal components of neural networks responsible for specific behaviors. While prior methods have made significant progress, they typically depend on heuristics or approximations and do not offer provable guarantees over continuous input domains for the resulting circuits. In this work, we leverage recent advances in neural network verification to propose a suite of automated algorithms that yield circuits with *provable guarantees*. We focus on three types of guarantees: (1) *input domain robustness*, ensuring the circuit agrees with the model across a continuous input region; (2) *robust patching*, certifying circuit alignment under continuous patching perturbations; and (3) *minimality*, formalizing and capturing a wide array of various notions of succinctness. Interestingly, we uncover a diverse set of novel theoretical connections among these three families of guarantees, with critical implications for the convergence of our algorithms. Finally, we conduct experiments with state-of-the-art verifiers on various vision models, showing that our algorithms yield circuits with substantially stronger robustness guarantees than standard circuit discovery methods, establishing a principled foundation for provable circuit discovery.</description>

      <title>HiVAE: Hierarchical Latent Variables for Scalable Theory of Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory of mind (ToM) enables AI systems to infer agents' hidden goals and mental states, but existing approaches focus mainly on small human understandable gridworld spaces. We introduce HiVAE, a hierarchical variational architecture that scales ToM reasoning to realistic spatiotemporal domains. Inspired by the belief-desire-intention structure of human cognition, our three-level VAE hierarchy achieves substantial performance improvements on a 3,185-node campus navigation task. However, we identify a critical limitation: while our hierarchical structure improves prediction, learned latent representations lack explicit grounding to actual mental states. We propose self-supervised alignment strategies and present this work to solicit community feedback on grounding approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning under noisy supervision is governed by a feedback-truth gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When feedback is absorbed faster than task structure can be evaluated, the learner will favor feedback over truth. A two-timescale model shows this feedback-truth gap is inevitable whenever the two rates differ and vanishes only when they match. We test this prediction across neural networks trained with noisy labels (30 datasets, 2,700 runs), human probabilistic reversal learning (N = 292), and human reward/punishment learning with concurrent EEG (N = 25). In each system, truth is defined operationally: held-out labels, the objectively correct option, or the participant's pre-feedback expectation - the only non-circular reference decodable from post-feedback EEG. The gap appeared universally but was regulated differently: dense networks accumulated it as memorization; sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed it; humans generated transient over-commitment that was actively recovered. Neural over-commitment (~0.04-0.10) was amplified tenfold into behavioral commitment (d = 3.3-3.9). The gap is a fundamental constraint on learning under noisy supervision; its consequences depend on the regulation each system employs.</description>

      <title>VAM: Verbalized Action Masking for Controllable Exploration in RL Post-Training -- A Chess Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration remains a key bottleneck for reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of large language models (LLMs), where sparse feedback and large action spaces can lead to premature collapse into repetitive behaviors. We propose Verbalized Action Masking (VAM), which verbalizes an action mask in the prompt and enforces that the model outputs an action from the masked set. Building on this interface, we introduce iterative action-space pruning: if the target action is not sampled, we remove valid sampled actions from the mask and resample under the reduced candidate set, repeating until the target is sampled or a fixed budget is exhausted. We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores. Across held-out chess puzzles and full-game play measured by average centipawn loss (ACPL), VAM improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong baselines, highlighting verbalized masking as a practical mechanism for controllable exploration in LLM RL post-training.</description>

      <title>A Residual-Aware Theory of Position Bias in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models systematically favor certain token positions, yet the architectural origins of this position bias remain poorly understood. Under causal masking at infinite depth, prior theoretical analyses of attention rollout predict an inevitable collapse of attention onto the first token. Such collapse, however, does not occur in practice. We resolve this discrepancy with a residual-aware theory of cumulative attention rollout. By incorporating residual connections, we show that this architectural component prevents collapse under realistic conditions. At finite depth, we prove that causal Transformers induce a U-shaped position bias, with attention concentrating on early and late tokens. This result provides a principled architectural explanation for the Lost-in-the-Middle phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Training Large Reasoning Models Efficiently via Progressive Thought Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel on complex problems but face a critical barrier to efficiency: reinforcement learning (RL) training requires long rollouts for outcome-based rewards, where autoregressive decoding dominates time and memory usage. While sliding-window cache strategies can bound memory, they disrupt long-context reasoning and degrade performance. We introduce Progressive Thought Encoding, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables LRMs to reason effectively under fixed-size caches. By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference. Experiments on three models, including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, on six widely used challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent gains: our method achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under the same tight cache budgets. These results demonstrate that Progressive Thought Encoding not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints.</description>

      <title>What is the Value of Censored Data? An Exact Analysis for the Data-driven Newsvendor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the offline data-driven newsvendor problem with censored demand data. In contrast to prior works where demand is fully observed, we consider the setting where demand is censored at the inventory level and only sales are observed; sales match demand when there is sufficient inventory, and equal the available inventory otherwise. We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand. Our results show that policies based on this sales-as-demand heuristic can suffer severe performance degradation as censored data accumulates, highlighting how the quality of point-of-sale information critically shapes what can, and cannot, be learned offline.</description>

      <title>On the Mechanism and Dynamics of Modular Addition: Fourier Features, Lottery Ticket, and Grokking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of how two-layer neural networks learn features to solve the modular addition task. Our work provides a full mechanistic interpretation of the learned model and a theoretical explanation of its training dynamics. While prior work has identified that individual neurons learn single-frequency Fourier features and phase alignment, it does not fully explain how these features combine into a global solution. We bridge this gap by formalizing a diversification condition that emerges during training when overparametrized, consisting of two parts: phase symmetry and frequency diversification. We prove that these properties allow the network to collectively approximate a flawed indicator function on the correct logic for the modular addition task. While individual neurons produce noisy signals, the phase symmetry enables a majority-voting scheme that cancels out noise, allowing the network to robustly identify the correct sum. Furthermore, we explain the emergence of these features under random initialization via a lottery ticket mechanism. Our gradient flow analysis proves that frequencies compete within each neuron, with the "winner" determined by its initial spectral magnitude and phase alignment. From a technical standpoint, we provide a rigorous characterization of the layer-wise phase coupling dynamics and formalize the competitive landscape using the ODE comparison lemma. Finally, we use these insights to demystify grokking, characterizing it as a three-stage process involving memorization followed by two generalization phases, driven by the competition between loss minimization and weight decay.</description>

      <title>Position: Why a Dynamical Systems Perspective is Needed to Advance Time Series Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series (TS) modeling has come a long way from early statistical, mainly linear, approaches to the current trend in TS foundation models. With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling.</description>

      <title>ML-driven detection and reduction of ballast information in multi-modal datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern datasets often contain ballast as redundant or low-utility information that increases dimensionality, storage requirements, and computational cost without contributing meaningful analytical value. This study introduces a generalized, multimodal framework for ballast detection and reduction across structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and sparse data types. Using diverse datasets, entropy, mutual information, Lasso, SHAP, PCA, topic modelling, and embedding analysis are applied to identify and eliminate ballast features. A novel Ballast Score is proposed to integrate these signals into a unified, cross-modal pruning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that significant portions of the feature space as often exceeding 70% in sparse or semi-structured data, can be pruned with minimal or even improved classification performance, along with substantial reductions in training time and memory footprint. The framework reveals distinct ballast typologies (e.g. statistical, semantic, infrastructural), and offers practical guidance for leaner, more efficient machine learning pipelines.</description>

      <title>Construction of a classification model for dementia among Brazilian adults aged 50 and over</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To build a dementia classification model for middle-aged and elderly Brazilians, implemented in Python, combining variable selection and multivariable analysis, using low-cost variables with modification potential. Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors. The RF model outperformed logistic regression, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.776, with a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.311, a G-means of 0.705, and an accuracy of 0.703. Conclusion: The findings reinforce the multidimensional nature of dementia and the importance of accessible factors for identifying vulnerable individuals. Strengthening public policies focused on promoting brain health can contribute significantly to the efficient allocation of resources in primary care and dementia prevention in Brazil</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a verification framework that provides both sound and complete guarantees for data poisoning attacks during neural network training. We formulate adversarial data manipulation, model training, and test-time evaluation in a single mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQCP) problem. Finding the global optimum of the proposed formulation provably yields worst-case poisoning attacks, while simultaneously bounding the effectiveness of all possible attacks on the given training pipeline. Our framework encodes both the gradient-based training dynamics and model evaluation at test time, enabling the first exact certification of training-time robustness. Experimental evaluation on small models confirms that our approach delivers a complete characterization of robustness against data poisoning.</description>

      <title>Beyond Message Passing: A Symbolic Alternative for Expressive and Interpretable Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery, yet their black-box nature remains a significant barrier to trustworthiness. While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. Notably, SymGraph delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Furthermore, SymGraph generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods, offering great potential for scientific discovery and explainable AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We challenge black-box purely deep neural approaches for molecules and graph generation, which are limited in controllability and lack formal guarantees. We introduce Neuro-Symbolic Graph Generative Modeling (NSGGM), a neurosymbolic framework that reapproaches molecule generation as a scaffold and interaction learning task with symbolic assembly. An autoregressive neural model proposes scaffolds and refines interaction signals, and a CPU-efficient SMT solver constructs full graphs while enforcing chemical validity, structural rules, and user-specific constraints, yielding molecules that are correct by construction and interpretable control that pure neural methods cannot provide. NSGGM delivers strong performance on both unconstrained generation and constrained generation tasks, demonstrating that neuro-symbolic modeling can match state-of-the-art generative performance while offering explicit controllability and guarantees. To evaluate more nuanced controllability, we also introduce a Logical-Constraint Molecular Benchmark, designed to test strict hard-rule satisfaction in workflows that require explicit, interpretable specifications together with verifiable compliance.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Lipschitz Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player stochastic bandit problem over a continuous, Lipschitz-structured action space where hard collisions yield zero reward. Our objective is to design a communication-free policy that maximizes collective reward, with coordination costs that are independent of the time horizon $T$. We propose a modular protocol that first solves the multi-agent coordination problem -- identifying and seating players on distinct high-value regions via a novel maxima-directed search -- and then decouples the problem into $N$ independent single-player Lipschitz bandits. We establish a near-optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$ plus a $T$-independent coordination cost, matching the single-player rate. To our knowledge, this is the first framework providing such guarantees, and it extends to general distance-threshold collision models.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Locality in Scalable MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenged by the curse of dimensionality. A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^\pi$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($\Pi(\pi)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $\Pi(\pi)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $\rho(E^{\mathrm{s}}+E^{\mathrm{a}}\Pi(\pi)) &lt; 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius.</description>

      <title>Early-Warning Signals of Grokking via Loss-Landscape Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization after prolonged training -- has been linked to confinement on low-dimensional execution manifolds in modular arithmetic. Whether this mechanism extends beyond arithmetic remains open. We study two sequence-learning benchmarks: SCAN compositional generalization and Dyck-1 depth prediction. Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding. These results identify the commutator defect as a robust, architecture-agnostic, causally implicated early-warning signal for delayed generalization in transformers.</description>

      <title>Fail-Closed Alignment for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a structural weakness in current large language model (LLM) alignment: modern refusal mechanisms are fail-open. While existing approaches encode refusal behaviors across multiple latent features, suppressing a single dominant feature$-$via prompt-based jailbreaks$-$can cause alignment to collapse, leading to unsafe generation. Motivated by this, we propose fail-closed alignment as a design principle for robust LLM safety: refusal mechanisms should remain effective even under partial failures via redundant, independent causal pathways. We present a concrete instantiation of this principle: a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces. Across four jailbreak attacks, we achieve the strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality, with small computational overhead. Our mechanistic analyses confirm that models trained with our method encode multiple, causally independent refusal directions that prompt-based jailbreaks cannot suppress simultaneously, providing empirical support for fail-closed alignment as a principled foundation for robust LLM safety.</description>

      <title>Discovering Universal Activation Directions for PII Leakage in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern language models exhibit rich internal structure, yet little is known about how privacy-sensitive behaviors, such as personally identifiable information (PII) leakage, are represented and modulated within their hidden states. We present UniLeak, a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions: latent directions in a model's residual stream whose linear addition at inference time consistently increases the likelihood of generating PII across prompts. These model-specific directions generalize across contexts and amplify PII generation probability, with minimal impact on generation quality. UniLeak recovers such directions without access to training data or groundtruth PII, relying only on self-generated text. Across multiple models and datasets, steering along these universal directions substantially increases PII leakage compared to existing prompt-based extraction methods. Our results offer a new perspective on PII leakage: the superposition of a latent signal in the model's representations, enabling both risk amplification and mitigation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Delayed Tree Expansion For Improved Multi-Path Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-path speculative decoding accelerates lossless sampling from a target model by using a cheaper draft model to generate a draft tree of tokens, and then applies a verification algorithm that accepts a subset of these. While prior work has proposed various verification algorithms for i.i.d rollouts, their relative performance under matched settings remains unclear. In this work, we firstly present a systematic evaluation of verification strategies across model families, tasks, and sampling regimes, and find that Traversal Verification dominates consistently, with OT-based methods lagging far behind. Our analysis uncovers that this occurs because OT-based methods achieve high multi-token acceptance near the root of the draft tree, while multi-token gains are most impactful deeper in the draft tree, where draft and target distributions diverge. Based on this insight, we propose delayed tree expansion, which drafts a partial single path, delaying the i.i.d. branching point. We show that delayed tree expansion preserves the target distribution and improves on root-node i.i.d rollouts. Further, we develop a dynamic neural selector that estimates the expected block efficiency of optimal-transport-based verification methods from draft and target features, enabling context-dependent expansion decisions. Our neural selector allows OT-based methods like SpecInfer to outperform Traversal Verification for the first time, achieving 5% higher average throughput across a wide range of models, datasets, and sampling settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the technical report for Arcee Trinity Large, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts model with 400B total parameters and 13B activated per token. Additionally, we report on Trinity Nano and Trinity Mini, with Trinity Nano having 6B total parameters with 1B activated per token, Trinity Mini having 26B total parameters with 3B activated per token. The models' modern architecture includes interleaved local and global attention, gated attention, depth-scaled sandwich norm, and sigmoid routing for Mixture-of-Experts. For Trinity Large, we also introduce a new MoE load balancing strategy titled Soft-clamped Momentum Expert Bias Updates (SMEBU). We train the models using the Muon optimizer. All three models completed training with zero loss spikes. Trinity Nano and Trinity Mini were pre-trained on 10 trillion tokens, and Trinity Large was pre-trained on 17 trillion tokens. The model checkpoints are available at https://huggingface.co/arcee-ai.</description>

      <title>Action-Graph Policies: Learning Action Co-dependencies in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating actions is the most fundamental form of cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Successful decentralized decision-making often depends not only on good individual actions, but on selecting compatible actions across agents to synchronize behavior, avoid conflicts, and satisfy global constraints. In this paper, we propose Action Graph Policies (AGP), that model dependencies among agents' available action choices. It constructs, what we call, \textit{coordination contexts}, that enable agents to condition their decisions on global action dependencies. Theoretically, we show that AGPs induce a strictly more expressive joint policy compared to fully independent policies and can realize coordinated joint actions that are provably more optimal than greedy execution even from centralized value-decomposition methods. Empirically, we show that AGP achieves 80-95\% success on canonical coordination tasks with partial observability and anti-coordination penalties, where other MARL methods reach only 10-25\%. We further demonstrate that AGP consistently outperforms these baselines in diverse multi-agent environments.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus as Stochastic Backpropogation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a rigorous connection between pathwise (reparameterization) and score-function (Malliavin) gradient estimators by showing that both arise from the Malliavin integration-by-parts identity. Building on this equivalence, we introduce a unified and variance-aware hybrid estimator that adaptively combines pathwise and Malliavin gradients using their empirical covariance structure. The resulting formulation provides a principled understanding of stochastic backpropagation and achieves minimum variance among all unbiased linear combinations, with closed-form finite-sample convergence bounds. We demonstrate 9% variance reduction on VAEs (CIFAR-10) and up to 35% on strongly-coupled synthetic problems. Exploratory policy gradient experiments reveal that non-stationary optimization landscapes present challenges for the hybrid approach, highlighting important directions for future work. Overall, this work positions Malliavin calculus as a conceptually unifying and practically interpretable framework for stochastic gradient estimation, clarifying when hybrid approaches provide tangible benefits and when they face inherent limitations.</description>

      <title>WS-GRPO: Weakly-Supervised Group-Relative Policy Optimization for Rollout-Efficient Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is effective for training language models on complex reasoning. However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines.</description>

      <title>Transforming Behavioral Neuroscience Discovery with In-Context Learning and AI-Enhanced Tensor Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific discovery pipelines typically involve complex, rigid, and time-consuming processes, from data preparation to analyzing and interpreting findings. Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of "In-Context Learning" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts. Finally, we demonstrate effective discovery, with results validated by the domain experts in the team.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Anomaly Precursors via Uncertainty-Aware Time-Series Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time-series data is critical in domains such as industrial operations, finance, and cybersecurity, where early identification of abnormal patterns is essential for ensuring system reliability and enabling preventive maintenance. However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH): Mitigating Embedding Collisions and Enhancing Model Freshness in Large-Scale Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding tables are critical components of large-scale recommendation systems, facilitating the efficient mapping of high-cardinality categorical features into dense vector representations. However, as the volume of unique IDs expands, traditional hash-based indexing methods suffer from collisions that degrade model performance and personalization quality. We present Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH), a novel indexing mechanism based on linear probing that effectively mitigates embedding collisions. With reasonable table sizing, it often eliminates these collisions entirely while maintaining production-scale efficiency. MPZCH utilizes auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels to implement configurable probing and active eviction policies. By retiring obsolete IDs and resetting reassigned slots, MPZCH prevents the stale embedding inheritance typical of hash-based methods, ensuring new features learn effectively from scratch. Despite its collision-mitigation overhead, the system maintains training QPS and inference latency comparable to existing methods. Rigorous online experiments demonstrate that MPZCH achieves zero collisions for user embeddings and significantly improves item embedding freshness and quality. The solution has been released within the open-source TorchRec library for the broader community.</description>

      <title>Sign Lock-In: Randomly Initialized Weight Signs Persist and Bottleneck Sub-Bit Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-bit model compression seeks storage below one bit per weight; as magnitudes are aggressively compressed, the sign bit becomes a fixed-cost bottleneck. Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal dual-stage hypergraph MARL for human-centric multimodal corridor traffic signal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-centric traffic signal control in corridor networks must increasingly account for multimodal travelers, particularly high-occupancy public transportation, rather than focusing solely on vehicle-centric performance. This paper proposes STDSH-MARL (Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stage Hypergraph based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning), a scalable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that follows a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. The proposed method captures spatio-temporal dependencies through a novel dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism that models interactions across both spatial and temporal hyperedges. In addition, a hybrid discrete action space is introduced to jointly determine the next signal phase configuration and its corresponding green duration, enabling more adaptive signal timing decisions. Experiments conducted on a corridor network under five traffic scenarios demonstrate that STDSH-MARL consistently improves multimodal performance and provides clear benefits for public transportation priority. Compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance. Further ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of STDSH-MARL, with temporal hyperedges identified as the most influential factor driving the observed performance gains.</description>

      <title>AdvSynGNN: Structure-Adaptive Graph Neural Nets via Adversarial Synthesis and Self-Corrective Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks frequently encounter significant performance degradation when confronted with structural noise or non-homophilous topologies. To address these systemic vulnerabilities, we present AdvSynGNN, a comprehensive architecture designed for resilient node-level representation learning. The proposed framework orchestrates multi-resolution structural synthesis alongside contrastive objectives to establish geometry-sensitive initializations. We develop a transformer backbone that adaptively accommodates heterophily by modulating attention mechanisms through learned topological signals. Central to our contribution is an integrated adversarial propagation engine, where a generative component identifies potential connectivity alterations while a discriminator enforces global coherence. Furthermore, label refinement is achieved through a residual correction scheme guided by per-node confidence metrics, which facilitates precise control over iterative stability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this synergistic approach effectively optimizes predictive accuracy across diverse graph distributions while maintaining computational efficiency. The study concludes with practical implementation protocols to ensure the robust deployment of the AdvSynGNN system in large-scale environments.</description>

      <title>Adam Improves Muon: Adaptive Moment Estimation with Orthogonalized Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient stochastic optimization typically integrates an update direction that performs well in the deterministic regime with a mechanism adapting to stochastic perturbations. While Adam uses adaptive moment estimates to promote stability, Muon utilizes the weight layers' matrix structure via orthogonalized momentum, showing superior performance in large language model training. We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation.</description>

      <title>MeGU: Machine-Guided Unlearning with Target Feature Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing concern over training data privacy has elevated the "Right to be Forgotten" into a critical requirement, thereby raising the demand for effective Machine Unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Transport-Based Generative Models and Latent Geometry for Stochastic Closure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models recently developed for generative AI tasks can produce high-quality samples while still maintaining diversity among samples to promote mode coverage, providing a promising path for learning stochastic closure models. Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.</description>

      <title>A Locality Radius Framework for Understanding Relational Inductive Bias in Database Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foreign key discovery and related schema-level prediction tasks are often modeled using graph neural networks (GNNs), implicitly assuming that relational inductive bias improves performance. However, it remains unclear when multi-hop structural reasoning is actually necessary. In this work, we introduce locality radius, a formal measure of the minimum structural neighborhood required to determine a prediction in relational schemas. We hypothesize that model performance depends critically on alignment between task locality radius and architectural aggregation depth. We conduct a controlled empirical study across foreign key prediction, join cost estimation, blast radius regression, cascade impact classification, and additional graph-derived schema tasks. Our evaluation includes multi-seed experiments, capacity-matched comparisons, statistical significance testing, scaling analysis, and synthetic radius-controlled benchmarks. Results reveal a consistent bias-radius alignment effect.</description>

      <title>FLoRG: Federated Fine-tuning with Low-rank Gram Matrices and Procrustes Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enable large language models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream tasks efficiently. Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\times$.</description>

      <title>Operationalization of Machine Learning with Serverless Architecture: An Industrial Operationalization of Machine Learning with Serverless Architecture: An Industrial Implementation for Harmonized System Code Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a serverless MLOps framework orchestrating the complete ML lifecycle from data ingestion, training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining to using event-driven pipelines and managed services. The architecture is model-agnostic, supporting diverse inference patterns through standardized interfaces, enabling rapid adaptation without infrastructure overhead. We demonstrate practical applicability through an industrial implementation for Harmonized System (HS) code prediction, a compliance-critical task where short, unstructured product descriptions are mapped to standardized codes used by customs authorities in global trade. Frequent updates and ambiguous descriptions make classification challenging, with errors causing shipment delays and financial losses. Our solution uses a custom text embedding encoder and multiple deep learning architectures, with Text-CNN achieving 98 percent accuracy on ground truth data. Beyond accuracy, the pipeline ensures reproducibility, auditability, and SLA adherence under variable loads via auto-scaling. A key feature is automated A/B testing, enabling dynamic model selection and safe promotion in production. Cost-efficiency drives model choice; while transformers may achieve similar accuracy, their long-term operational costs are significantly higher. Deterministic classification with predictable latency and explainability is prioritized, though the architecture remains extensible to transformer variants and LLM-based inference. The paper first introduces the deep learning architectures with simulations and model comparisons, then discusses industrialization through serverless architecture, demonstrating automated retraining, prediction, and validation of HS codes. This work provides a replicable blueprint for operationalizing ML using serverless architecture, enabling enterprises to scale while optimizing performance and economics.</description>

      <title>i-PhysGaussian: Implicit Physical Simulation for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical simulation predicts future states of objects based on material properties and external loads, enabling blueprints for both Industry and Engineering to conduct risk management. Current 3D reconstruction-based simulators typically rely on explicit, step-wise updates, which are sensitive to step time and suffer from rapid accuracy degradation under complicated scenarios, such as high-stiffness materials or quasi-static movement. To address this, we introduce i-PhysGaussian, a framework that couples 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with an implicit Material Point Method (MPM) integrator. Unlike explicit methods, our solution obtains an end-of-step state by minimizing a momentum-balance residual through implicit Newton-type optimization with a GMRES solver. This formulation significantly reduces time-step sensitivity and ensures physical consistency. Our results demonstrate that i-PhysGaussian maintains stability at up to 20x larger time steps than explicit baselines, preserving structural coherence and smooth motion even in complex dynamic transitions.</description>

      <title>TIFO: Time-Invariant Frequency Operator for Stationarity-Aware Representation Learning in Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonstationary time series forecasting suffers from the distribution shift issue due to the different distributions that produce the training and test data. Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset. In addition, TIFO reduces computational costs by 60% -70% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating strong scalability across diverse forecasting models.</description>

      <title>VP-VAE: Rethinking Vector Quantization via Adaptive Vector Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental to modern generative modeling, yet they often suffer from training instability and "codebook collapse" due to the inherent coupling of representation learning and discrete codebook optimization. In this paper, we propose VP-VAE (Vector Perturbation VAE), a novel paradigm that decouples representation learning from discretization by eliminating the need for an explicit codebook during training. Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers. Extensive experiments on image and audio benchmarks demonstrate that VP-VAE and FSP improve reconstruction fidelity and achieve substantially more balanced token usage, while avoiding the instability inherent to coupled codebook training.</description>

      <title>When More Experts Hurt: Underfitting in Multi-Expert Learning to Defer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to Defer (L2D) enables a classifier to abstain from predictions and defer to an expert, and has recently been extended to multi-expert settings. In this work, we show that multi-expert L2D is fundamentally more challenging than the single-expert case. With multiple experts, the classifier's underfitting becomes inherent, which seriously degrades prediction performance, whereas in the single-expert setting it arises only under specific conditions. We theoretically reveal that this stems from an intrinsic expert identifiability issue: learning which expert to trust from a diverse pool, a problem absent in the single-expert case and renders existing underfitting remedies failed. To tackle this issue, we propose PiCCE (Pick the Confident and Correct Expert), a surrogate-based method that adaptively identifies a reliable expert based on empirical evidence. PiCCE effectively reduces multi-expert L2D to a single-expert-like learning problem, thereby resolving multi expert underfitting. We further prove its statistical consistency and ability to recover class probabilities and expert accuracies. Extensive experiments across diverse settings, including real-world expert scenarios, validate our theoretical results and demonstrate improved performance.</description>

      <title>TimeOmni-VL: Unified Models for Time Series Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent time series modeling faces a sharp divide between numerical generation and semantic understanding, with research showing that generation models often rely on superficial pattern matching, while understanding-oriented models struggle with high-fidelity numerical output. Although unified multimodal models (UMMs) have bridged this gap in vision, their potential for time series remains untapped. We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation. Experiments confirm that this unified approach significantly improves both semantic understanding and numerical precision, establishing a new frontier for multimodal time series modeling.</description>

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a gradient-free alternative to first-order (FO) methods by estimating gradients via finite differences of function evaluations, and has recently emerged as a memory-efficient paradigm for fine-tuning large-scale models by avoiding backpropagation. However, ZO optimization has a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency. In this work, we show that ZO optimization can be substantially improved by unifying two complementary principles: (i) a projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting the intrinsic low-rank structure of model updates, and (ii) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. These findings form a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, which we instantiate in a new method, ZO-Muon, admitting a natural interpretation as a low-rank Muon optimizer in the ZO setting. Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning in Linear vs. Quadratic Attention Models: An Empirical Study on Regression Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that transformers and linear attention models can perform in-context learning (ICL) on simple function classes, such as linear regression. In this paper, we empirically study how these two attention mechanisms differ in their ICL behavior on the canonical linear-regression task of Garg et al. We evaluate learning quality (MSE), convergence, and generalization behavior of each architecture. We also analyze how increasing model depth affects ICL performance. Our results illustrate both the similarities and limitations of linear attention relative to quadratic attention in this setting.</description>

      <title>Continual uncertainty learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust control of mechanical systems with multiple uncertainties remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when nonlinear dynamics and operating-condition variations are intricately intertwined. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer.</description>

      <title>SoftDTW-CUDA-Torch: Memory-Efficient GPU-Accelerated Soft Dynamic Time Warping for PyTorch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present softdtw-cuda-torch, an open-source PyTorch library for computing Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) on GPUs. Our implementation addresses three key limitations of existing GPU implementations of SoftDTW: a hard sequence-length cap of 1024, numerical instability in the backward pass for small smoothing parameters, and excessive GPU memory consumption from materializing pairwise distance tensors. We introduce (1) tiled anti-diagonal kernel execution that removes the sequence-length constraint, (2) a log-space back-ward pass that prevents floating-point overflow, and (3) a fused distance-computation mode that eliminates the O(BN M ) intermediate distance tensor, achieving up to 98% memory reduction compared to prior work. The library supports arbitrary sequence lengths, full PyTorch autograd integration, and Soft-DTW Barycenter computation. Code is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/sdtw-cuda-torch.</description>

      <title>CounterFlowNet: From Minimal Changes to Meaningful Counterfactual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) provide human-interpretable insights into model's predictions by identifying minimal changes to input features that would alter the model's output. However, existing methods struggle to generate multiple high-quality explanations that (1) affect only a small portion of the features, (2) can be applied to tabular data with heterogeneous features, and (3) are consistent with the user-defined constraints. We propose CounterFlowNet, a generative approach that formulates CF generation as sequential feature modification using conditional Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet). CounterFlowNet is trained to sample CFs proportionally to a user-specified reward function that can encode key CF desiderata: validity, sparsity, proximity and plausibility, encouraging high-quality explanations. The sequential formulation yields highly sparse edits, while a unified action space seamlessly supports continuous and categorical features. Moreover, actionability constraints, such as immutability and monotonicity of features, can be enforced at inference time via action masking, without retraining. Experiments on eight datasets under two evaluation protocols demonstrate that CounterFlowNet achieves superior trade-offs between validity, sparsity, plausibility, and diversity with full satisfaction of the given constraints.</description>

      <title>Structured Prototype-Guided Adaptation for EEG Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models (EFMs) have achieved strong performance under full fine-tuning but exhibit poor generalization when subject-level supervision is limited, a common constraint in real-world clinical settings. We show that this failure stems not merely from limited supervision, but from a structural mismatch between noisy, limited supervision and the highly plastic parameter space of EFMs. To address this challenge, we propose SCOPE, a Structured COnfidence-aware Prototype-guided adaptation framework for EFM fine-tuning. SCOPE follows a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we construct reliable external supervision by learning geometry-regularized task priors, constructing balanced class-level prototypes over the resulting embeddings, and producing confidence-aware pseudo-labels from their agreement to filter unreliable signals on unlabeled data. In the second stage, we introduce ProAdapter, which adapts frozen EEG foundation models via a lightweight adapter conditioned on the structured prototypes. Experiments across three EEG tasks and five foundation model backbones demonstrate that SCOPE consistently achieves strong performance and efficiency under label-limited cross-subject settings.</description>

      <title>Learning a Latent Pulse Shape Interface for Photoinjector Laser Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the longitudinal laser pulse shape in photoinjectors of Free-Electron Lasers is a powerful lever for optimizing electron beam quality, but systematic exploration of the vast design space is limited by the cost of brute-force pulse propagation simulations. We present a generative modeling framework based on Wasserstein Autoencoders to learn a differentiable latent interface between pulse shaping and downstream beam dynamics. Our empirical findings show that the learned latent space is continuous and interpretable while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families such as higher-order Gaussians trace coherent trajectories, while standardizing the temporal pulse lengths shows a latent organization correlated with pulse energy. Analysis via principal components and Gaussian Mixture Models reveals a well behaved latent geometry, enabling smooth transitions between distinct pulse types via linear interpolation. The model generalizes from simulated data to real experimental pulse measurements, accurately reconstructing pulses and embedding them consistently into the learned manifold. Overall, the approach reduces reliance on expensive pulse-propagation simulations and facilitates downstream beam dynamics simulation and analysis.</description>

      <title>Unified Latents (UL): How to train your latents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Unified Latents (UL), a framework for learning latent representations that are jointly regularized by a diffusion prior and decoded by a diffusion model. By linking the encoder's output noise to the prior's minimum noise level, we obtain a simple training objective that provides a tight upper bound on the latent bitrate. On ImageNet-512, our approach achieves competitive FID of 1.4, with high reconstruction quality (PSNR) while requiring fewer training FLOPs than models trained on Stable Diffusion latents. On Kinetics-600, we set a new state-of-the-art FVD of 1.3.</description>

      <title>RLGT: A reinforcement learning framework for extremal graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing models that can autonomously learn optimal decision-making strategies over time. In a recent pioneering paper, Wagner demonstrated how the Deep Cross-Entropy RL method can be applied to tackle various problems from extremal graph theory by reformulating them as combinatorial optimization problems. Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Tur\'{a}n-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four. Here, we present Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory (RLGT), a novel RL framework that systematizes the previous work and provides support for both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with an arbitrary number of edge colors. The framework efficiently represents graphs and aims to facilitate future RL-based research in extremal graph theory through optimized computational performance and a clean and modular design.</description>

      <title>Efficient privacy loss accounting for subsampling and random allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the privacy amplification properties of a sampling scheme in which a user's data is used in $k$ steps chosen randomly and uniformly from a sequence (or set) of $t$ steps. This sampling scheme has been recently applied in the context of differentially private optimization (Chua et al., 2024a; Choquette-Choo et al., 2025) and communication-efficient high-dimensional private aggregation (Asi et al., 2025), where it was shown to have utility advantages over the standard Poisson sampling. Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman &amp; Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.
  In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization. This notion allows us to extend accurate privacy loss accounting to subsampling which previously required manual noise-mechanism-specific analysis.</description>

      <title>LexiSafe: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning with Lexicographic Safety-Reward Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly important for cyber-physical systems (CPS), where safety violations during training are unacceptable and only pre-collected data are available. Existing offline safe RL methods typically balance reward-safety tradeoffs through constraint relaxation or joint optimization, but they often lack structural mechanisms to prevent safety drift. We propose LexiSafe, a lexicographic offline RL framework designed to preserve safety-aligned behavior. We first develop LexiSafe-SC, a single-cost formulation for standard offline safe RL, and derive safety-violation and performance-suboptimality bounds that together yield sample-complexity guarantees. We then extend the framework to hierarchical safety requirements with LexiSafe-MC, which supports multiple safety costs and admits its own sample-complexity analysis. Empirically, LexiSafe demonstrates reduced safety violations and improved task performance compared to constrained offline baselines. By unifying lexicographic prioritization with structural bias, LexiSafe offers a practical and theoretically grounded approach for safety-critical CPS decision-making.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Flickering Multi-Armed Bandits (FMAB), a new MAB framework where the set of available arms (or actions) can change at each round, and the available set at any time may depend on the agent's previously selected arm. We model this constrained, evolving availability using random graph processes, where arms are nodes and the agent's movement is restricted to its local neighborhood. We analyze this problem under two random graph models: an i.i.d. Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) process and an Edge-Markovian process. We propose and analyze a two-phase algorithm that employs a lazy random walk for exploration to efficiently identify the optimal arm, followed by a navigation and commitment phase for exploitation. We establish high-probability and expected sublinear regret bounds for both graph settings. We show that the exploration cost of our algorithm is near-optimal by establishing a matching information-theoretic lower bound for this problem class, highlighting the fundamental cost of exploration under local-move constraints. We complement our theoretical guarantees with numerical simulations, including a scenario of a robotic ground vehicle scouting a disaster-affected region.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Death: Deep Learning Reveals Vascular Damage from Carotid Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, yet early risk detection is often limited by available diagnostics. Carotid ultrasound, a non-invasive and widely accessible modality, encodes rich structural and hemodynamic information that is largely untapped. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework that extracts clinically meaningful representations of vascular damage (VD) from carotid ultrasound videos, using hypertension as a weak proxy label. The model learns robust features that are biologically plausible, interpretable, and strongly associated with established cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and laboratory measures. High VD stratifies individuals for myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality, matching or outperforming conventional risk models such as SCORE2. Explainable AI analyses reveal that the model relies on vessel morphology and perivascular tissue characteristics, uncovering novel functional and anatomical signatures of vascular damage. This work demonstrates that routine carotid ultrasound contains far more prognostic information than previously recognized. Our approach provides a scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective tool for population-wide cardiovascular risk assessment, enabling earlier and more personalized prevention strategies without reliance on laboratory tests or complex clinical inputs.</description>

      <title>SubQuad: Near-Quadratic-Free Structure Inference with Distribution-Balanced Objectives in Adaptive Receptor framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparative analysis of adaptive immune repertoires at population scale is hampered by two practical bottlenecks: the near-quadratic cost of pairwise affinity evaluations and dataset imbalances that obscure clinically important minority clonotypes. We introduce SubQuad, an end-to-end pipeline that addresses these challenges by combining antigen-aware, near-subquadratic retrieval with GPU-accelerated affinity kernels, learned multimodal fusion, and fairness-constrained clustering. The system employs compact MinHash prefiltering to sharply reduce candidate comparisons, a differentiable gating module that adaptively weights complementary alignment and embedding channels on a per-pair basis, and an automated calibration routine that enforces proportional representation of rare antigen-specific subgroups. On large viral and tumor repertoires SubQuad achieves measured gains in throughput and peak memory usage while preserving or improving recall@k, cluster purity, and subgroup equity. By co-designing indexing, similarity fusion, and equity-aware objectives, SubQuad offers a scalable, bias-aware platform for repertoire mining and downstream translational tasks such as vaccine target prioritization and biomarker discovery.</description>

      <title>From Subtle to Significant: Prompt-Driven Self-Improving Optimization in Test-Time Graph OOD Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify whether a test graph deviates from the distribution of graphs observed during training, which is critical for ensuring the reliability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) when deployed in open-world scenarios. Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{I}mproving \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}ut-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and outperformance of our SIGOOD method. The code is at https://github.com/Ee1s/SIGOOD.</description>

      <title>Shortcut learning in geometric knot classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying the topology of closed curves is a central problem in low dimensional topology with applications beyond mathematics spanning protein folding, polymer physics and even magnetohydrodynamics. The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges.</description>

      <title>2Mamba2Furious: Linear in Complexity, Competitive in Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear attention transformers have become a strong alternative to softmax attention due to their efficiency. However, linear attention tends to be less expressive and results in reduced accuracy compared to softmax attention. To bridge the accuracy gap between softmax attention and linear attention, we manipulate Mamba-2, a very strong linear attention variant. We first simplify Mamba-2 down to its most fundamental and important components, evaluating which specific choices make it most accurate. From this simplified Mamba variant (Mamba-2S), we improve the A-mask and increase the order of the hidden state, resulting in a method, which we call 2Mamba, that is nearly as accurate as softmax attention, yet much more memory efficient for long context lengths. We also investigate elements to Mamba-2 that help surpass softmax attention accuracy. Code is provided for all our experiments</description>

      <title>A feature-stable and explainable machine learning framework for trustworthy decision-making under incomplete clinical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly applied to biomedical data, yet their adoption in high stakes domains remains limited by poor robustness, limited interpretability, and instability of learned features under realistic data perturbations, such as missingness. In particular, models that achieve high predictive performance may still fail to inspire trust if their key features fluctuate when data completeness changes, undermining reproducibility and downstream decision-making. Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data. By explicitly quantifying robustness to missing data and prioritising interpretable, stable features, CACTUS offers a generalizable framework for trustworthy data-driven decision support.</description>

      <title>MDP Planning as Policy Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We cast episodic Markov decision process (MDP) planning as Bayesian inference over _policies_. A policy is treated as the latent variable and is assigned an unnormalized probability of optimality that is monotone in its expected return, yielding a posterior distribution whose modes coincide with return-maximizing solutions while posterior dispersion represents uncertainty over optimal behavior. To approximate this posterior in discrete domains, we adapt variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) to inference over deterministic policies under stochastic dynamics, introducing a sweep that enforces policy consistency across revisited states and couples transition randomness across particles to avoid confounding from simulator noise. Acting is performed by posterior predictive sampling, which induces a stochastic control policy through a Thompson-sampling interpretation rather than entropy regularization. Across grid worlds, Blackjack, Triangle Tireworld, and Academic Advising, we analyze the structure of inferred policy distributions and compare the resulting behavior to discrete Soft Actor-Critic, highlighting qualitative and statistical differences that arise from policy-level uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Two-Layer Neural Networks under Gaussian Input Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence guarantee of two-layer neural network training with Gaussian randomly masked inputs. This scenario corresponds to Gaussian dropout at the input level, or noisy input training common in sensor networks, privacy-preserving training, and federated learning, where each user may have access to partial or corrupted features. Using a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we demonstrate that training a two-layer ReLU network with Gaussian randomly masked inputs achieves linear convergence up to an error region proportional to the mask's variance. A key technical contribution is resolving the randomness within the non-linear activation, a problem of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Variational Grey-Box Dynamics Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models such as flow matching and diffusion models have shown great potential in learning complex distributions and dynamical systems, but often act as black-boxes, neglecting underlying physics. In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model. Our code is available at https://github.com/DMML-Geneva/VGB-DM.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence in Games with Delayed Feedback via Extra Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback delays are inevitable in real-world multi-agent learning. They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\exp(-\Theta(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\exp(-\Theta(t/(m^{2}\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays.</description>

      <title>Learning with Boolean threshold functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for training neural networks on Boolean data in which the values at all nodes are strictly $\pm 1$, and the resulting models are typically equivalent to networks whose nonzero weights are also $\pm 1$. The method replaces loss minimization with a nonconvex constraint formulation. Each node implements a Boolean threshold function (BTF), and training is expressed through a divide-and-concur decomposition into two complementary constraints: one enforces local BTF consistency between inputs, weights, and output; the other imposes architectural concurrence, equating neuron outputs with downstream inputs and enforcing weight equality across training-data instantiations of the network. The reflect-reflect-relax (RRR) projection algorithm is used to reconcile these constraints.
  Each BTF constraint includes a lower bound on the margin. When this bound is sufficiently large, the learned representations are provably sparse and equivalent to networks composed of simple logical gates with $\pm 1$ weights. Across a range of tasks -- including multiplier-circuit discovery, binary autoencoding, logic-network inference, and cellular automata learning -- the method achieves exact solutions or strong generalization in regimes where standard gradient-based methods struggle. These results demonstrate that projection-based constraint satisfaction provides a viable and conceptually distinct foundation for learning in discrete neural systems, with implications for interpretability and efficient inference.</description>

      <title>Retrospective In-Context Learning for Temporal Credit Assignment with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from self-sampled data and sparse environmental feedback remains a fundamental challenge in training self-evolving agents. Temporal credit assignment mitigates this issue by transforming sparse feedback into dense supervision signals. However, previous approaches typically depend on learning task-specific value functions for credit assignment, which suffer from poor sample efficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs for temporal credit assignment, paving the way for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL paradigms.</description>

      <title>LORA-CRAFT: Cross-layer Rank Adaptation via Frozen Tucker Decomposition of Pre-trained Attention Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CRAFT (Cross-layer Rank Adaptation via Frozen Tucker), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that applies Tucker tensor decomposition to pre-trained attention weight matrices stacked across transformer layers and trains only small square adaptation matrices on the resulting frozen Tucker factors. Existing tensor-based PEFT methods decompose gradient updates: LoTR applies Tucker decomposition with shared factor matrices, while SuperLoRA groups and reshapes $\Delta W$ across layers before applying Tucker decomposition. Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large demonstrate that CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters--a count independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks.</description>

      <title>Variational inference via radial transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In variational inference (VI), the practitioner approximates a high-dimensional distribution $\pi$ with a simple surrogate one, often a (product) Gaussian distribution. However, in many cases of practical interest, Gaussian distributions might not capture the correct radial profile of $\pi$, resulting in poor coverage. In this work, we approach the VI problem from the perspective of optimizing over these radial profiles. Our algorithm radVI is a cheap, effective add-on to many existing VI schemes, such as Gaussian (mean-field) VI and Laplace approximation. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our algorithm, owing to recent developments in optimization over the Wasserstein space--the space of probability distributions endowed with the Wasserstein distance--and new regularity properties of radial transport maps in the style of Caffarelli (2000).</description>

      <title>The Anxiety of Influence: Bloom Filters in Transformer Attention Heads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some transformer attention heads appear to function as membership testers, dedicating themselves to answering the question "has this token appeared before in the context?" We identify these heads across four language models (GPT-2 small, medium, and large; Pythia-160M) and show that they form a spectrum of membership-testing strategies. Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis.</description>

      <title>Provably Explaining Neural Additive Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in post-hoc explanation methods for neural networks, many remain heuristic and lack provable guarantees. A key approach for obtaining explanations with provable guarantees is by identifying a cardinally-minimal subset of input features which by itself is provably sufficient to determine the prediction. However, for standard neural networks, this task is often computationally infeasible, as it demands a worst-case exponential number of verification queries in the number of input features, each of which is NP-hard.
  In this work, we show that for Neural Additive Models (NAMs), a recent and more interpretable neural network family, we can efficiently generate explanations with such guarantees. We present a new model-specific algorithm for NAMs that generates provably cardinally-minimal explanations using only a logarithmic number of verification queries
  in the number of input features, after a parallelized preprocessing step with logarithmic runtime in the required precision is applied to each small univariate NAM component.
  Our algorithm not only makes the task of obtaining cardinally-minimal explanations feasible, but even outperforms existing algorithms designed to find the relaxed variant of subset-minimal explanations - which may be larger and less informative but easier to compute - despite our algorithm solving a much more difficult task.
  Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous algorithms, our approach provides provably smaller explanations than existing works and substantially reduces the computation time. Moreover, we show that our generated provable explanations offer benefits that are unattainable by standard sampling-based techniques typically used to interpret NAMs.</description>

      <title>Position: Evaluation of ECG Representations Must Be Fixed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper argues that current benchmarking practice in 12-lead ECG representation learning must be fixed to ensure progress is reliable and aligned with clinically meaningful objectives. The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting.</description>

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) algorithms, such as GRPO, rely on rigid, uniform, and symmetric trust region mechanisms that are fundamentally misaligned with the complex optimization dynamics of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in these methods: (1) inefficient gradient utilization caused by the binary cutoff of hard clipping, (2) insensitive probability mass arising from uniform ratio constraints that ignore the token distribution, and (3) asymmetric signal reliability stemming from the disparate credit assignment ambiguity between positive and negative samples. To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Modular Learning of Robust Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large-scale generative models is resource-intensive and relies heavily on heuristic dataset weighting. We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Weight Regularization for Low-Rank Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) with large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) has recently gained wide attention, shifting the focus from training from scratch to continually adapting PTMs. This has given rise to a promising paradigm: parameter-efficient continual learning (PECL), where task interference is typically mitigated by assigning a task-specific module during training, such as low-rank adapters. However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

      <description>arXiv:2602.17568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalization and scaling are fundamental preprocessing steps in time series modeling, yet their role in Transformer-based models remains underexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>Canonicalizing Multimodal Contrastive Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As models and data scale, independently trained networks often induce analogous notions of similarity. But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\widetilde{f},\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\top Q = I$ such that $\widetilde{f}(x)\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\widetilde{g}(y)\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\langle f(x), g(y)\rangle \approx \langle \widetilde{f}(x), \widetilde{g}(y)\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models. More broadly, this finding enables backward-compatible model upgrades, avoiding costly re-embedding, and has implications for the privacy of learned representations.

      <title>Asymptotic Smoothing of the Lipschitz Loss Landscape in Overparameterized One-Hidden-Layer ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topology of the loss landscape of one-hidden-layer ReLU networks under overparameterization. On the theory side, we (i) prove that for convex $L$-Lipschitz losses with an $\ell_1$-regularized second layer, every pair of models at the same loss level can be connected by a continuous path within an arbitrarily small loss increase $\epsilon$ (extending a known result for the quadratic loss); (ii) obtain an asymptotic upper bound on the energy gap $\epsilon$ between local and global minima that vanishes as the width $m$ grows, implying that the landscape flattens and sublevel sets become connected in the limit. Empirically, on a synthetic Moons dataset and on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, we measure pairwise energy gaps via Dynamic String Sampling (DSS) and find that wider networks exhibit smaller gaps; in particular, a permutation test on the maximum gap yields $p_{perm}=0$, indicating a clear reduction in the barrier height.</description>

      <title>Towards Anytime-Valid Statistical Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient mechanisms to distinguish machine-generated content from human text. While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Guarding the Middle: Protecting Intermediate Representations in Federated Split Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big data scenarios, where massive, heterogeneous datasets are distributed across clients, demand scalable, privacy-preserving learning methods. Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets. More importantly, KD-UFSL improves privacy while preserving the utility of the global model. This highlights its suitability for large-scale big data applications where privacy and utility must be balanced.</description>

      <title>Stable Asynchrony: Variance-Controlled Off-Policy RL for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to improve large language models on reasoning tasks, and asynchronous RL training is attractive because it increases end-to-end throughput. However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, we find collapse is reliably predicted by effective sample size (ESS) and unstable gradient norms. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants. This reduces long-context, multi-turn training time by 2.5$\times$ while matching synchronous performance, demonstrating that explicit control of policy-gradient variance is key for reliable asynchronous RL at scale.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Forgetting Resilient One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern big-data systems generate massive, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed streams that are large-scale and privacy-sensitive, making centralization challenging. While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>SMAC: Score-Matched Actor-Critics for Robust Offline-to-Online Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods find performant actor-critics, however, fine-tuning these actor-critics online with value-based RL algorithms typically causes immediate drops in performance. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that, in the loss landscape, offline maxima for prior algorithms and online maxima are separated by low-performance valleys that gradient-based fine-tuning traverses. Following this, we present Score Matched Actor-Critic (SMAC), an offline RL method designed to learn actor-critics that transition to online value-based RL algorithms with no drop in performance. SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization. SMAC achieves smooth transfer to Soft Actor-Critic and TD3 in 6/6 D4RL tasks. In 4/6 environments, it reduces regret by 34-58% over the best baseline.</description>

      <title>When to Trust the Cheap Check: Weak and Strong Verification for Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning with LLMs increasingly unfolds inside a broader verification loop. Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.</description>

      <title>Reverso: Efficient Time Series Foundation Models for Zero-shot Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning time series foundation models has been shown to be a promising approach for zero-shot time series forecasting across diverse time series domains. Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.</description>

      <title>FAMOSE: A ReAct Approach to Automated Feature Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature engineering remains a critical yet challenging bottleneck in machine learning, particularly for tabular data, as identifying optimal features from an exponentially large feature space traditionally demands substantial domain expertise. To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering.</description>

Abstract: Traditional electronic recycling processes suffer from significant resource loss due to inadequate material separation and identification capabilities, limiting material recovery. We present A.R.I.S. (Automated Recycling Identification System), a low-cost, portable sorter for shredded e-waste that addresses this efficiency gap. The system employs a YOLOx model to classify metals, plastics, and circuit boards in real time, achieving low inference latency with high detection accuracy. Experimental evaluation yielded 90% overall precision, 82.2% mean average precision (mAP), and 84% sortation purity. By integrating deep learning with established sorting methods, A.R.I.S. enhances material recovery efficiency and lowers barriers to advanced recycling adoption. This work complements broader initiatives in extending product life cycles, supporting trade-in and recycling programs, and reducing environmental impact across the supply chain.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Frontier of Black-Box LVLM Attacks via Fine-Grained Detail Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

      <title>Multi-Round Human-AI Collaboration with User-Specified Requirements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As humans increasingly rely on multiround conversational AI for high stakes decisions, principled frameworks are needed to ensure such interactions reliably improve decision quality. We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.</description>

      <title>MARS: Margin-Aware Reward-Modeling with Self-Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward modeling is a core component of modern alignment pipelines including RLHF and RLAIF, underpinning policy optimization methods including PPO and TRPO. However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.</description>

      <title>Efficient Remote Prefix Fetching with GPU-native Media ASICs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09725v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote KV cache reuse fetches KV cache for identical contexts from remote storage, avoiding recomputation, accelerating LLM inference. While it excels in high-speed networks, its performance degrades significantly in bandwidth-limited scenarios. Recent studies address this by transmitting KV caches in compressed form, but the associated heavyweight decompression counteracts the KV reuse benefits. In this paper, we propose an efficient and widely deployable remote KV cache reuse solution that leverages GPU-native video codecs. Our system, KVFetcher, enables effective KV cache coding with two techniques. The codec-friendly tensor layout compresses the KV cache in a highly compact video format, enabling fast transmission. The efficient KV fetcher orchestrates the transmission, decoding, and restoration of compressed KV caches in an efficient pipelined manner, eliminating resource contention, masking network fluctuations, and achieving minimum time-to-first-token (TTFT). We prototype KVFetcher on diverse GPUs from high- to low-end. Experiments reveal that it reduces TTFT by up to 3.51 times while maintaining lossless accuracy, compared to SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>DARTH-PUM: A Hybrid Processing-Using-Memory Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog processing-using-memory (PUM; a.k.a. in-memory computing) makes use of electrical interactions inside memory arrays to perform bulk matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operations. However, many popular matrix-based kernels need to execute non-MVM operations, which analog PUM cannot directly perform. To retain its energy efficiency, analog PUM architectures augment memory arrays with CMOS-based domain-specific fixed-function hardware to provide complete kernel functionality, but the difficulty of integrating such specialized CMOS logic with memory arrays has largely limited analog PUM to being an accelerator for machine learning inference, or for closely related kernels. An opportunity exists to harness analog PUM for general-purpose computation: recent works have shown that memory arrays can also perform Boolean PUM operations, albeit with very different supporting hardware and electrical signals than analog PUM.
  We propose DARTH-PUM, a general-purpose hybrid PUM architecture that tackles key hardware and software challenges to integrating analog PUM and digital PUM. We propose optimized peripheral circuitry, coordinating hardware to manage and interface between both types of PUM, an easy-to-use programming interface, and low-cost support for flexible data widths. These design elements allow us to build a practical PUM architecture that can execute kernels fully in memory, and can scale easily to cater to domains ranging from embedded applications to large-scale data-driven computing. We show how three popular applications (AES encryption, convolutional neural networks, large-language models) can map to and benefit from DARTH-PUM, with speedups of 59.4x, 14.8x, and 40.8x over an analog+CPU baseline.</description>

Abstract: Numerous models have shown great success in the fields of speech recognition as well as speech synthesis, but models for speech to speech processing have not been heavily explored. We propose Speech to Speech Synthesis Network (STSSN), a model based on current state of the art systems that fuses the two disciplines in order to perform effective speech to speech style transfer for the purpose of voice impersonation. We show that our proposed model is quite powerful, and succeeds in generating realistic audio samples despite a number of drawbacks in its capacity. We benchmark our proposed model by comparing it with a generative adversarial model which accomplishes a similar task, and show that ours produces more convincing results.</description>

      <title>Mobility-Aware Cache Framework for Scalable LLM-Based Human Mobility Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for applications such as urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.</description>

      <title>Intent Laundering: AI Safety Datasets Are Not What They Seem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically evaluate the quality of widely used AI safety datasets from two perspectives: in isolation and in practice. In isolation, we examine how well these datasets reflect real-world attacks based on three key properties: driven by ulterior intent, well-crafted, and out-of-distribution. We find that these datasets overrely on "triggering cues": words or phrases with overt negative/sensitive connotations that are intended to trigger safety mechanisms explicitly, which is unrealistic compared to real-world attacks. In practice, we evaluate whether these datasets genuinely measure safety risks or merely provoke refusals through triggering cues. To explore this, we introduce "intent laundering": a procedure that abstracts away triggering cues from attacks (data points) while strictly preserving their malicious intent and all relevant details. Our results indicate that current AI safety datasets fail to faithfully represent real-world attacks due to their overreliance on triggering cues. In fact, once these cues are removed, all previously evaluated "reasonably safe" models become unsafe, including Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Moreover, when intent laundering is adapted as a jailbreaking technique, it consistently achieves high attack success rates, ranging from 90% to over 98%, under fully black-box access. Overall, our findings expose a significant disconnect between how model safety is evaluated and how real-world adversaries behave.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Utility of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry and Antimicrobial Resistance in Hospital Outbreak Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and timely identification of hospital outbreak clusters is crucial for preventing the spread of infections that have epidemic potential. While assessing pathogen similarity through whole genome sequencing (WGS) is considered the gold standard for outbreak detection, its high cost and lengthy turnaround time preclude routine implementation in clinical laboratories. We explore the utility of two rapid and cost-effective alternatives to WGS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and antimicrobial resistance (AR) patterns. We develop a machine learning framework that extracts informative representations from MALDI-TOF spectra and AR patterns for outbreak detection and explore their fusion. Through multi-species analyses, we demonstrate that in some cases MALDI-TOF and AR have the potential to reduce reliance on WGS, enabling more accessible and rapid outbreak surveillance.</description>

      <title>Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Network for Industrial IoT Predictive Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial IoT predictive maintenance requires systems capable of real-time anomaly detection without sacrificing interpretability or demanding excessive computational resources. Traditional approaches rely on static, offline-trained models that cannot adapt to evolving operational conditions, while LLM-based monolithic systems demand prohibitive memory and latency, rendering them impractical for on-site edge deployment. We introduce SEMAS, a self-evolving hierarchical multi-agent system that distributes specialized agents across Edge, Fog, and Cloud computational tiers. Edge agents perform lightweight feature extraction and pre-filtering; Fog agents execute diversified ensemble detection with dynamic consensus voting; and Cloud agents continuously optimize system policies via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) while maintaining asynchronous, non-blocking inference. The framework incorporates LLM-based response generation for explainability and federated knowledge aggregation for adaptive policy distribution. This architecture enables resource-aware specialization without sacrificing real-time performance or model interpretability. Empirical evaluation on two industrial benchmarks (Boiler Emulator and Wind Turbine) demonstrates that SEMAS achieves superior anomaly detection performance with exceptional stability under adaptation, sustains prediction accuracy across evolving operational contexts, and delivers substantial latency improvements enabling genuine real-time deployment. Ablation studies confirm that PPO-driven policy evolution, consensus voting, and federated aggregation each contribute materially to system effectiveness. These findings indicate that resource-aware, self-evolving 1multi-agent coordination is essential for production-ready industrial IoT predictive maintenance under strict latency and explainability constraints.</description>

      <title>Can Adversarial Code Comments Fool AI Security Reviewers -- Large-Scale Empirical Study of Comment-Based Attacks and Defenses Against LLM Code Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-assisted code review is widely used to detect vulnerabilities before production release. Prior work shows that adversarial prompt manipulation can degrade large language model (LLM) performance in code generation. We test whether similar comment-based manipulation misleads LLMs during vulnerability detection. We build a 100-sample benchmark across Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants ranging from no comments to adversarial strategies such as authority spoofing and technical deception. Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p &gt; 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total). Static analysis cross-referencing performs best at 96.9 percent detection and recovers 47 percent of baseline misses. Comment stripping reduces detection for weaker models by removing helpful context. Failures concentrate on inherently difficult vulnerability classes, including race conditions, timing side channels, and complex authorization logic, rather than on adversarial comments.</description>

      <title>U-FedTomAtt: Ultra-lightweight Federated Learning with Attention for Tomato Disease Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving and efficient approach for deploying intelligent agricultural solutions. Accurate edge-based diagnosis across geographically dispersed farms is crucial for recognising tomato diseases in sustainable farming. Traditional centralised training aggregates raw data on a central server, leading to communication overhead, privacy risks and latency. Meanwhile, edge devices require lightweight networks to operate effectively within limited resources. In this paper, we propose U-FedTomAtt, an ultra-lightweight federated learning framework with attention for tomato disease recognition in resource-constrained and distributed environments. The model comprises only 245.34K parameters and 71.41 MFLOPS. First, we propose an ultra-lightweight neural network with dilated bottleneck (DBNeck) modules and a linear transformer to minimise computational and memory overhead. To mitigate potential accuracy loss, a novel local-global residual attention (LoGRA) module is incorporated. Second, we propose the federated dual adaptive weight aggregation (FedDAWA) algorithm that enhances global model accuracy. Third, our framework is validated using three benchmark datasets for tomato diseases under simulated federated settings. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 0.9910% and 0.9915% Top-1 accuracy and 0.9923% and 0.9897% F1-scores on SLIF-Tomato and PlantVillage tomato datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Beyond Procedure: Substantive Fairness in Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) offers distribution-free uncertainty quantification for machine learning models, yet its interplay with fairness in downstream decision-making remains underexplored. Moving beyond CP as a standalone operation (procedural fairness), we analyze the holistic decision-making pipeline to evaluate substantive fairness-the equity of downstream outcomes. Theoretically, we derive an upper bound that decomposes prediction-set size disparity into interpretable components, clarifying how label-clustered CP helps control method-driven contributions to unfairness. To facilitate scalable empirical analysis, we introduce an LLM-in-the-loop evaluator that approximates human assessment of substantive fairness across diverse modalities. Our experiments reveal that label-clustered CP variants consistently deliver superior substantive fairness. Finally, we empirically show that equalized set sizes, rather than coverage, strongly correlate with improved substantive fairness, enabling practitioners to design more fair CP systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/llm-in-the-loop-conformal-fairness.</description>

Abstract: We show that large language models can be used to perform at-scale deanonymization. With full Internet access, our agent can re-identify Hacker News users and Anthropic Interviewer participants at high precision, given pseudonymous online profiles and conversations alone, matching what would take hours for a dedicated human investigator. We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives. Compared to prior deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data or manual feature engineering, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method. Our results show that the practical obscurity protecting pseudonymous users online no longer holds and that threat models for online privacy need to be reconsidered.</description>

      <title>References Improve LLM Alignment in Non-Verifiable Domains</title>

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown strong effectiveness in reasoning tasks, it cannot be directly applied to non-verifiable domains lacking ground-truth verifiers, such as LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate whether reference-guided LLM-evaluators can bridge this gap by serving as soft "verifiers". First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model. Specifically, our method achieves 73.1% and 58.7% on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and 70.0% and 74.1% with Qwen2.5-7B, corresponding to average absolute gains of +20.2 / +17.1 points over SFT distillation and +5.3 / +3.6 points over reference-free self-improvement on AlpacaEval / Arena-Hard. These results highlight the potential of using reference-guided LLM-evaluators to enable effective LLM post-training in non-verifiable domains.</description>

      <title>Simple Baselines are Competitive with Code Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code evolution is a family of techniques that rely on large language models to search through possible computer programs by evolving or mutating existing code. Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Gym: Training Coding Agents to Generalize Across Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When assessing the quality of coding agents, predominant benchmarks focus on solving single issues on GitHub, such as SWE-Bench. In contrast, in real use, these agents solve more various and complex tasks that involve other skills such as exploring codebases, testing software, and designing architecture. In this paper, we first characterize some transferable skills that are shared across diverse tasks by decomposing trajectories into fine-grained components, and derive a set of principles for designing auxiliary training tasks to teach language models these skills. Guided by these principles, we propose a training environment, Hybrid-Gym, consisting of a set of scalable synthetic tasks, such as function localization and dependency search. Experiments show that agents trained on our synthetic tasks effectively generalize to diverse real-world tasks that are not present in training, improving a base model by 25.4% absolute gain on SWE-Bench Verified, 7.9% on SWT-Bench Verified, and 5.1% on Commit-0 Lite. Hybrid-Gym also complements datasets built for the downstream tasks (e.g., improving SWE-Play by 4.9% on SWT-Bench Verified). Code available at: https://github.com/yiqingxyq/Hybrid-Gym.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Formations on Football Matches Using Double Machine Learning. Is it worth parking the bus?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a central tactical dilemma for football coaches: whether to employ a defensive strategy, colloquially known as "parking the bus", or a more offensive one. Using an advanced Double Machine Learning (DML) framework, this project provides a robust and interpretable tool to estimate the causal impact of different formations on key match outcomes such as goal difference, possession, corners, and disciplinary actions. Leveraging a dataset of over 22,000 matches from top European leagues, formations were categorized into six representative types based on tactical structure and expert consultation. A major methodological contribution lies in the adaptation of DML to handle categorical treatments, specifically formation combinations, through a novel matrix-based residualization process, allowing for a detailed estimation of formation-versus-formation effects that can inform a coach's tactical decision-making. Results show that while offensive formations like 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 offer modest statistical advantages in possession and corners, their impact on goals is limited. Furthermore, no evidence supports the idea that defensive formations, commonly associated with parking the bus, increase a team's winning potential. Additionally, red cards appear unaffected by formation choice, suggesting other behavioral factors dominate. Although this approach does not fully capture all aspects of playing style or team strength, it provides a valuable framework for coaches to analyze tactical efficiency and sets a precedent for future research in sports analytics.</description>

      <title>NeST: Neuron Selective Tuning for LLM Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for the responsible deployment of large language models (LLMs). Yet, existing approaches often rely on heavyweight fine-tuning that is costly to update, audit, and maintain across model families. Full fine-tuning incurs substantial computational and storage overhead, while parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA trade efficiency for inconsistent safety gains and sensitivity to design choices. Safety intervention mechanisms such as circuit breakers reduce unsafe outputs without modifying model weights, but do not directly shape or preserve the internal representations that govern safety behavior. These limitations hinder rapid and reliable safety updates, particularly in settings where models evolve frequently or must adapt to new policies and domains.
  We present NeST, a lightweight, structure-aware safety alignment framework that strengthens refusal behavior by selectively adapting a small subset of safety-relevant neurons while freezing the remainder of the model. NeST aligns parameter updates with the internal organization of safety behavior by clustering functionally coherent safety neurons and enforcing shared updates within each cluster, enabling targeted and stable safety adaptation without broad model modification or inference-time overhead. We benchmark NeST against three dominant baselines: full fine-tuning, LoRA-based fine-tuning, and circuit breakers across 10 open-weight LLMs spanning multiple model families and sizes. Across all evaluated models, NeST reduces the attack success rate from an average of 44.5% to 4.36%, corresponding to a 90.2% reduction in unsafe generations, while requiring only 0.44 million trainable parameters on average. This amounts to a 17,310x decrease in updated parameters compared to full fine-tuning and a 9.25x reduction relative to LoRA, while consistently achieving stronger safety performance for alignment.</description>

      <title>MALLVI: a multi agent framework for integrated generalized robotics manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task planning for robotic manipulation with large language models (LLMs) is an emerging area. Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings.We present MALLVi, a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI.</description>

      <title>LLM-WikiRace: Benchmarking Long-term Planning and Reasoning over Real-World Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LLM-Wikirace, a benchmark for evaluating planning, reasoning, and world knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In LLM-Wikirace, models must efficiently navigate Wikipedia hyperlinks step by step to reach a target page from a given source, requiring look-ahead planning and the ability to reason about how concepts are connected in the real world. We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering. LLM-Wikirace is a simple benchmark that reveals clear limitations in current reasoning systems, offering an open arena where planning-capable LLMs still have much to prove.

      <title>Multi-objective optimization and quantum hybridization of equivariant deep learning interatomic potentials on organic and inorganic compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allegro is a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) model designed to predict atomic properties in molecules using E(3) equivariant neural networks. When training this model, there tends to be a trade-off between accuracy and inference time. For this reason we apply multi-objective hyperparameter optimization to the two objectives. Additionally, we experiment with modified architectures by making variants of Allegro some by adding strictly classical multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers and some by adding quantum-classical hybrid layers. We compare the results from QM9, rMD17-aspirin, rMD17-benzene and our own proprietary dataset consisting of copper and lithium atoms. As results, we have a list of variants that surpass the Allegro in accuracy and also results which demonstrate the trade-off with inference times.</description>

      <title>A statistical perspective on transformers for small longitudinal cohort data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling of longitudinal cohort data typically involves complex temporal dependencies between multiple variables. There, the transformer architecture, which has been highly successful in language and vision applications, allows us to account for the fact that the most recently observed time points in an individual's history may not always be the most important for the immediate future. This is achieved by assigning attention weights to observations of an individual based on a transformation of their values. One reason why these ideas have not yet been fully leveraged for longitudinal cohort data is that typically, large datasets are required. Therefore, we present a simplified transformer architecture that retains the core attention mechanism while reducing the number of parameters to be estimated, to be more suitable for small datasets with few time points. Guided by a statistical perspective on transformers, we use an autoregressive model as a starting point and incorporate attention as a kernel-based operation with temporal decay, where aggregation of multiple transformer heads, i.e. different candidate weighting schemes, is expressed as accumulating evidence on different types of underlying characteristics of individuals. This also enables a permutation-based statistical testing procedure for identifying contextual patterns. In a simulation study, the approach is shown to recover contextual dependencies even with a small number of individuals and time points. In an application to data from a resilience study, we identify temporal patterns in the dynamics of stress and mental health. This indicates that properly adapted transformers can not only achieve competitive predictive performance, but also uncover complex context dependencies in small data settings.</description>

      <title>Poisson-MNL Bandit: Nearly Optimal Dynamic Joint Assortment and Pricing with Decision-Dependent Customer Arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dynamic joint assortment and pricing where a seller updates decisions at regular accounting/operating intervals to maximize the cumulative per-period revenue over a horizon $T$. In many settings, assortment and prices affect not only what an arriving customer buys but also how many customers arrive within the period, whereas classical multinomial logit (MNL) models assume arrivals as fixed, potentially leading to suboptimal decisions. We propose a Poisson-MNL model that couples a contextual MNL choice model with a Poisson arrival model whose rate depends on the offered assortment and prices. Building on this model, we develop an efficient algorithm PMNL based on the idea of upper confidence bound (UCB). We establish its (near) optimality by proving a non-asymptotic regret bound of order $\sqrt{T\log{T}}$ and a matching lower bound (up to $\log T$). Simulation studies underscore the importance of accounting for the dependency of arrival rates on assortment and pricing: PMNL effectively learns customer choice and arrival models and provides joint assortment-pricing decisions that outperform others that assume fixed arrival rates.</description>

      <title>DeepContext: Stateful Real-Time Detection of Multi-Turn Adversarial Intent Drift in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities have scaled, safety guardrails remain largely stateless, treating multi-turn dialogues as a series of disconnected events. This lack of temporal awareness facilitates a "Safety Gap" where adversarial tactics, like Crescendo and ActorAttack, slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass stateless filters. We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67). Furthermore, DeepContext maintains a sub-20ms inference overhead on a T4 GPU, ensuring viability for real-time applications. These results suggest that modeling the sequential evolution of intent is a more effective and computationally efficient alternative to deploying massive, stateless models.</description>

      <title>BrainRVQ: A High-Fidelity EEG Foundation Model via Dual-Domain Residual Quantization and Hierarchical Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the signal's low signal-to-noise ratio and complex spectro-temporal non-stationarity. Existing approaches often overlook the hierarchical latent structure inherent in neural dynamics, leading to suboptimal reconstruction of fine-grained information. In this work, we propose BrainRVQ, a general-purpose EEG foundation model pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of clinical EEG data. Unlike standard masked modeling, BrainRVQ features a Dual-Domain Residual Vector Quantization (DD-RVQ) tokenizer that disentangles temporal waveforms and spectral patterns into hierarchical discrete codes. We further introduce a hierarchical autoregressive pre-training objective that learns to reconstruct these codes in a coarse-to-fine manner, utilizing an importance-guided curriculum masking strategy to prioritize information-rich neural events over background noise. Extensive experiments across 8 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate that BrainRVQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in learning robust and generalizable neural representations.

      <title>LLM4Cov: Execution-Aware Agentic Learning for High-coverage Testbench Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Execution-aware LLM agents offer a promising paradigm for learning from tool feedback, but such feedback is often expensive and slow to obtain, making online reinforcement learning (RL) impractical. High-coverage hardware verification exemplifies this challenge due to its reliance on industrial simulators and non-differentiable execution signals. We propose LLM4Cov, an offline agent-learning framework that models verification as memoryless state transitions guided by deterministic evaluators. Building on this formulation, we introduce execution-validated data curation, policy-aware agentic data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling to enable scalable learning under execution constraints. We further curate a reality-aligned benchmark adapted from an existing verification suite through a revised evaluation protocol. Using the proposed pipeline, a compact 4B-parameter model achieves 69.2% coverage pass rate under agentic evaluation, outperforming its teacher by 5.3% and demonstrating competitive performance against models an order of magnitude larger.</description>

      <title>Automating Agent Hijacking via Structural Template Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent hijacking, highlighted by OWASP as a critical threat to the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem, enables adversaries to manipulate execution by injecting malicious instructions into retrieved content. Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Greedy Multi-Path Block Verification for Faster Decoding in Speculative Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of $L$-step speculative decoding is to accelerate autoregressive decoding of a target model by using a cheaper draft model to generate a candidate path of $L$ tokens. Based on a verification algorithm involving target and draft model probabilities, a prefix of the candidate sequence is accepted, and an additional correction token is sampled from a residual distribution to ensure that the final output adheres to the target distribution. While standard speculative decoding uses a verification algorithm which is independent at each token on the path, a recent extension called block verification uses a joint condition involving all sampled on-path probabilities. Block verification (BV) was shown to be optimal over all verification algorithms which use only on-path probabilities, improving on standard speculative decoding. In this work, we first show that block verification is optimal even over verification algorithms that use off-path probabilities, by constructing an information-agnostic linear program (LP). Further, we can extend our LP to the setting where the draft model samples multiple candidate paths, and use it to construct a natural class of multi-path block verification generalizations. While computing the optimal algorithm in this class is not tractable, by considering a stricter class of greedy algorithms, we can formulate an efficient method called greedy multi-path block verification (GBV). Empirically, GBV can improve block efficiency by over 30% and reduce decoding walltimes by over 15% relative to BV. On Llama-3 70B, GBV can improve the end-to-end decoding throughput over SOTA multi-path verification methods by more than 15%.</description>

      <title>HQFS: Hybrid Quantum Classical Financial Security with VQC Forecasting, QUBO Annealing, and Audit-Ready Post-Quantum Signing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here's the corrected paragraph with all punctuation and formatting issues fixed:
  Financial risk systems usually follow a two-step routine: a model predicts return or risk, and then an optimizer makes a decision such as a portfolio rebalance. In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Predictive Impact of Modalities with Supervised Latent-Variable Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), existing approaches predominantly assume the availability of multiple modalities during training and inference. In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels.</description>

      <title>LiveGraph: Active-Structure Neural Re-ranking for Exercise Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous expansion of digital learning environments has catalyzed the demand for intelligent systems capable of providing personalized educational content. While current exercise recommendation frameworks have made significant strides, they frequently encounter obstacles regarding the long-tailed distribution of student engagement and the failure to adapt to idiosyncratic learning trajectories. We present LiveGraph, a novel active-structure neural re-ranking framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach utilizes a graph-based representation enhancement strategy to bridge the information gap between active and inactive students while integrating a dynamic re-ranking mechanism to foster content diversity. By prioritizing the structural relationships within learning histories, the proposed model effectively balances recommendation precision with pedagogical variety. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that LiveGraph surpasses contemporary baselines in both predictive accuracy and the breadth of exercise diversity.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Cross-Lingual Classification Approaches Enabling Topic Discovery for Multilingual Social Media Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysing multilingual social media discourse remains a major challenge in natural language processing, particularly when large-scale public debates span across diverse languages. This study investigates how different approaches for cross-lingual text classification can support reliable analysis of global conversations. Using hydrogen energy as a case study, we analyse a decade-long dataset of over nine million tweets in English, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean (2013--2022) for topic discovery. The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training. Each approach is evaluated for its ability to filter hydrogen-related tweets from noisy keyword-based collections. Subsequently, topic modeling is performed to extract dominant themes within the relevant subsets. The results highlight key trade-offs between translation and multilingual approaches, offering actionable insights into optimising cross-lingual pipelines for large-scale social media analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Decision-Making under Model Misspecification: A Stochastic Stability Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic decision-making under model uncertainty is central to many economic environments, yet existing bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms rely on the assumption of correct model specification. This paper studies the behavior and performance of one of the most commonly used Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithms, Thompson Sampling (TS), when the model class is misspecified. We first provide a complete dynamic classification of posterior evolution in a misspecified two-armed Gaussian bandit, identifying distinct regimes: correct model concentration, incorrect model concentration, and persistent belief mixing, characterized by the direction of statistical evidence and the model-action mapping. These regimes yield sharp predictions for limiting beliefs, action frequencies, and asymptotic regret. We then extend the analysis to a general finite model class and develop a unified stochastic stability framework that represents posterior evolution as a Markov process on the belief simplex. This approach characterizes two sufficient conditions to classify the ergodic and transient behaviors and provides inductive dimensional reductions of the posterior dynamics. Our results offer the first qualitative and geometric classification of TS under misspecification, bridging Bayesian learning with evolutionary dynamics, and also build the foundations of robust decision-making in structured bandits.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Portfolio Allocation: A Comparative Study with Mean-Variance Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio Management is the process of overseeing a group of investments, referred to as a portfolio, with the objective of achieving predetermined investment goals. Portfolio optimization is a key component that involves allocating the portfolio assets so as to maximize returns while minimizing risk taken. It is typically carried out by financial professionals who use a combination of quantitative techniques and investment expertise to make decisions about the portfolio allocation.
  Recent applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have shown promising results when used to optimize portfolio allocation by training model-free agents on historical market data. Many of these methods compare their results against basic benchmarks or other state-of-the-art DRL agents but often fail to compare their performance against traditional methods used by financial professionals in practical settings. One of the most commonly used methods for this task is Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (MVO), which uses historical time series information to estimate expected asset returns and covariances, which are then used to optimize for an investment objective.
  Our work is a thorough comparison between model-free DRL and MVO for optimal portfolio allocation. We detail the specifics of how to make DRL for portfolio optimization work in practice, also noting the adjustments needed for MVO. Backtest results demonstrate strong performance of the DRL agent across many metrics, including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdowns, and absolute returns.</description>

      <title>Simplify to Amplify: Achieving Information-Theoretic Bounds with Fewer Steps in Spectral Community Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a streamlined spectral algorithm for community detection in the two-community stochastic block model (SBM) under constant edge density assumptions. By reducing algorithmic complexity through the elimination of non-essential preprocessing steps, our method directly leverages the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix. We demonstrate that our algorithm exploits specific characteristics of the second eigenvalue to achieve improved error bounds that approach information-theoretic limits, representing a significant improvement over existing methods. Theoretical analysis establishes that our error rates are tighter than previously reported bounds in the literature. Comprehensive experimental validation confirms our theoretical findings and demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the simplified approach. Our results suggest that algorithmic simplification, rather than increasing complexity, can lead to both computational efficiency and enhanced performance in spectral community detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) work remarkably well in semi-supervised node regression, yet a rigorous theory explaining when and why they succeed remains lacking. To address this gap, we study an aggregate-and-readout model that encompasses several common message passing architectures: node features are first propagated over the graph then mapped to responses via a nonlinear function. For least-squares estimation over GNNs with linear graph convolutions and a deep ReLU readout, we prove a sharp non-asymptotic risk bound that separates approximation, stochastic, and optimization errors. The bound makes explicit how performance scales with the fraction of labeled nodes and graph-induced dependence. Approximation guarantees are further derived for graph-smoothing followed by smooth nonlinear readouts, yielding convergence rates that recover classical nonparametric behavior under full supervision while characterizing performance when labels are scarce. Numerical experiments validate our theory, providing a systematic framework for understanding GNN performance and limitations.</description>

      <title>Anti-causal domain generalization: Leveraging unlabeled data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of domain generalization concerns learning predictive models that are robust to distribution shifts when deployed in new, previously unseen environments. Existing methods typically require labeled data from multiple training environments, limiting their applicability when labeled data are scarce. In this work, we study domain generalization in an anti-causal setting, where the outcome causes the observed covariates. Under this structure, environment perturbations that affect the covariates do not propagate to the outcome, which motivates regularizing the model's sensitivity to these perturbations. Crucially, estimating these perturbation directions does not require labels, enabling us to leverage unlabeled data from multiple environments. We propose two methods that penalize the model's sensitivity to variations in the mean and covariance of the covariates across environments, respectively, and prove that these methods have worst-case optimality guarantees under certain classes of environments. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical performance of our approach on a controlled physical system and a physiological signal dataset.</description>

      <title>MGD: Moment Guided Diffusion for Maximum Entropy Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating samples from limited information is a fundamental problem across scientific domains. Classical maximum entropy methods provide principled uncertainty quantification from moment constraints but require sampling via MCMC or Langevin dynamics, which typically exhibit exponential slowdown in high dimensions. In contrast, generative models based on diffusion and flow matching efficiently transport noise to data but offer limited theoretical guarantees and can overfit when data is scarce. We introduce Moment Guided Diffusion (MGD), which combines elements of both approaches. Building on the stochastic interpolant framework, MGD samples maximum entropy distributions by solving a stochastic differential equation that guides moments toward prescribed values in finite time, thereby avoiding slow mixing in equilibrium-based methods. We formally obtain, in the large-volatility limit, convergence of MGD to the maximum entropy distribution and derive a tractable estimator of the resulting entropy computed directly from the dynamics. Applications to financial time series, turbulent flows, and cosmological fields using wavelet scattering moments yield estimates of negentropy for high-dimensional multiscale processes.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms Enable Cheap Verifiable Inference of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, fewer users are able to host and run models locally. This has led to increased use of third-party hosting services. However, in this setting, there is a lack of guarantees on the computation performed by the inference provider. For example, a dishonest provider may replace an expensive large model with a cheaper-to-run weaker model and return the results from the weaker model to the user. Existing tools to verify inference typically rely on methods from cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), but these add significant computational overhead, and remain infeasible for use for large models. In this work, we develop a new insight -- that given a method for performing private LLM inference, one can obtain forms of verified inference at marginal extra cost. Specifically, we propose two new protocols which leverage privacy-preserving LLM inference in order to provide guarantees over the inference that was carried out. Our approaches are cheap, requiring the addition of a few extra tokens of computation, and have little to no downstream impact. As the fastest privacy-preserving inference methods are typically faster than ZK methods, the proposed protocols also improve verification runtime. Our work provides novel insights into the connections between privacy and verifiability in LLM inference.</description>

      <title>All Leaks Count, Some Count More: Interpretable Temporal Contamination Detection in LLM Backtesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To evaluate whether LLMs can accurately predict future events, we need the ability to \textit{backtest} them on events that have already resolved. This requires models to reason only with information available at a specified past date. Yet LLMs may inadvertently leak post-cutoff knowledge encoded during training, undermining the validity of retrospective evaluation. We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \emph{temporal knowledge leakage}. Our approach decomposes model rationales into atomic claims and categorizes them by temporal verifiability, then applies \textit{Shapley values} to measure each claim's contribution to the prediction. This yields the \textbf{Shapley}-weighted \textbf{D}ecision-\textbf{C}ritical \textbf{L}eakage \textbf{R}ate (\textbf{Shapley-DCLR}), an interpretable metric that captures what fraction of decision-driving reasoning derives from leaked information. Building on this framework, we propose \textbf{Time}-\textbf{S}upervised \textbf{P}rediction with \textbf{E}xtracted \textbf{C}laims (\textbf{TimeSPEC}), which interleaves generation with claim verification and regeneration to proactively filter temporal contamination -- producing predictions where every supporting claim can be traced to sources available before the cutoff date. Experiments on 350 instances spanning U.S. Supreme Court case prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking reveal substantial leakage in standard prompting baselines. TimeSPEC reduces Shapley-DCLR while preserving task performance, demonstrating that explicit, interpretable claim-level verification outperforms prompt-based temporal constraints for reliable backtesting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum generative modeling, where the Born rule naturally defines probability distributions through measurement of parameterized quantum states, is a promising near-term application of quantum computing. We propose a Quantum Scrambling Born Machine in which a fixed entangling unitary -- acting as a scrambling reservoir -- provides multi-qubit entanglement, while only single-qubit rotations are optimized. We consider three entangling unitaries -- a Haar random unitary and two physically realizable approximations, a finite-depth brickwork random circuit and analog time evolution under nearest-neighbor spin-chain Hamiltonians -- and show that, for the benchmark distributions and system sizes considered, once the entangler produces near-Haar-typical entanglement the model learns the target distribution with weak sensitivity to the scrambler's microscopic origin. Finally, promoting the Hamiltonian couplings to trainable parameters casts the generative task as a variational Hamiltonian problem, with performance competitive with representative classical generative models at matched parameter count.</description>

      <title>Representation Collapse in Machine Translation Through the Lens of Angular Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern neural translation models based on the Transformer architecture are known for their high performance, particularly when trained on high-resource datasets. A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization.</description>

      <title>MedClarify: An information-seeking AI agent for medical diagnosis with case-specific follow-up questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for diagnostic tasks in medicine. In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Open Datasets in Learning Analytics: Trends, Challenges, and Best PRACTICE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open datasets play a crucial role in three research domains that intersect data science and education: learning analytics, educational data mining, and artificial intelligence in education. Researchers in these domains apply computational methods to analyze data from educational contexts, aiming to better understand and improve teaching and learning. Providing open datasets alongside research papers supports reproducibility, collaboration, and trust in research findings. It also provides individual benefits for authors, such as greater visibility, credibility, and citation potential. Despite these advantages, the availability of open datasets and the associated practices within the learning analytics research communities, especially at their flagship conference venues, remain unclear. We surveyed available datasets published alongside research papers in learning analytics. We manually examined 1,125 papers from three flagship conferences (LAK, EDM, and AIED) over the past five years. We discovered, categorized, and analyzed 172 datasets used in 204 publications. Our study presents the most comprehensive collection and analysis of open educational datasets to date, along with the most detailed categorization. Of the 172 datasets identified, 143 were not captured in any prior survey of open data in learning analytics. We provide insights into the datasets' context, analytical methods, use, and other properties. Based on this survey, we summarize the current gaps in the field. Furthermore, we list practical recommendations, advice, and 8-item guidelines under the acronym PRACTICE with a checklist to help researchers publish their data. Lastly, we share our original dataset: an annotated inventory detailing the discovered datasets and the corresponding publications. We hope these findings will support further adoption of open data practices in learning analytics communities and beyond.</description>

      <title>Partial Optimality in the Preordering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preordering is a generalization of clustering and partial ordering with applications in bioinformatics and social network analysis. Given a finite set $V$ and a value $c_{ab} \in \mathbb{R}$ for every ordered pair $ab$ of elements of $V$, the preordering problem asks for a preorder $\lesssim$ on $V$ that maximizes the sum of the values of those pairs $ab$ for which $a \lesssim b$. Building on the state of the art in solving this NP-hard problem partially, we contribute new partial optimality conditions and efficient algorithms for deciding these conditions. In experiments with real and synthetic data, these new conditions increase, in particular, the fraction of pairs $ab$ for which it is decided efficiently that $a \not\lesssim b$ in an optimal preorder.</description>

      <title>SpectralGCD: Spectral Concept Selection and Cross-modal Representation Learning for Generalized Category Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify novel categories in unlabeled data while leveraging a small labeled subset of known classes. Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/miccunifi/SpectralGCD.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification for Long-Form Language Model Outputs: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has emerged as an effective approach to closed-book hallucination detection for LLMs, but existing methods are largely designed for short-form outputs and do not generalize well to long-form generation. We introduce a taxonomy for fine-grained uncertainty quantification in long-form LLM outputs that distinguishes methods by design choices at three stages: response decomposition, unit-level scoring, and response-level aggregation. We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs. Our framework clarifies relationships between prior methods, enables apples-to-apples comparisons, and provides practical guidance for selecting components for fine-grained UQ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks have been a standard evaluation practice for measuring LLMs' ability to reason and answer knowledge-based questions. Through a synthetic NonsenseQA benchmark, we observe that different LLMs exhibit varying degrees of label-position-few-shot-prompt bias, where the model either uses the answer position, the label in front of the answer, the distributions of correct answers present in the few-shot prompt, or a combination of all to answer each MCQ question. We propose a simple bias-reduced evaluation protocol that replaces the labels of each question with uniform, unordered labels and prompts the LLM to use the whole answer presented. With a simple sentence similarity model, we demonstrate improved robustness and lower standard deviation between different permutations of answers with a minimal drop in LLM's performance, exposing the LLM's capabilities under reduced evaluation artifacts, without any help from the prompt examples or the option labels. Across multiple benchmarks and models, this protocol substantially improves the robustness to answer permutations, reducing mean accuracy variance $3\times$ with only a minimal decrease in the mean model's performance. Through ablation studies on various embedding models and similarity functions, we show that the method is more robust than the standard ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic camera systems enable dynamic, repeatable motion beyond human capabilities, yet their adoption remains limited by the high cost and operational complexity of industrial-grade platforms. We present the Intelligent Robotic Imaging System (IRIS), a task-specific 6-DOF manipulator designed for autonomous, learning-driven cinematic motion control. IRIS integrates a lightweight, fully 3D-printed hardware design with a goal-conditioned visuomotor imitation learning framework based on Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT). The system learns object-aware and perceptually smooth camera trajectories directly from human demonstrations, eliminating the need for explicit geometric programming. The complete platform costs under $1,000 USD, supports a 1.5 kg payload, and achieves approximately 1 mm repeatability. Real-world experiments demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, reliable autonomous execution, and generalization across diverse cinematic motions.</description>

      <title>genriesz: A Python Package for Automatic Debiased Machine Learning with Generalized Riesz Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient estimation of causal and structural parameters can be automated using the Riesz representation theorem and debiased machine learning (DML). We present genriesz, an open-source Python package that implements automatic DML and generalized Riesz regression, a unified framework for estimating Riesz representers by minimizing empirical Bregman divergences. This framework includes covariate balancing, nearest-neighbor matching, calibrated estimation, and density ratio estimation as special cases. A key design principle of the package is automatic regressor balancing (ARB): given a Bregman generator $g$ and a representer model class, genriesz} automatically constructs a compatible link function so that the generalized Riesz regression estimator satisfies balancing (moment-matching) optimality conditions in a user-chosen basis. The package provides a modulr interface for specifying (i) the target linear functional via a black-box evaluation oracle, (ii) the representer model via basis functions (polynomial, RKHS approximations, random forest leaf encodings, neural embeddings, and a nearest-neighbor catchment basis), and (iii) the Bregman generator, with optional user-supplied derivatives. It returns regression adjustment (RA), Riesz weighting (RW), augmented Riesz weighting (ARW), and TMLE-style estimators with cross-fitting, confidence intervals, and $p$-values. We highlight representative workflows for estimation problems such as the average treatment effect (ATE), ATE on treated (ATT), and average marginal effect estimation. The Python package is available at https://github.com/MasaKat0/genriesz and on PyPI.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Decentralized Composite Optimization via Three-Operator Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies decentralized optimization over networks, where agents minimize a sum of {\it locally} smooth (strongly) convex losses and plus a nonsmooth convex extended value term. We propose decentralized methods wherein agents {\it adaptively} adjust their stepsize via local backtracking procedures coupled with lightweight min-consensus protocols. Our design stems from a three-operator splitting factorization applied to an equivalent reformulation of the problem. The reformulation is endowed with a new BCV preconditioning metric (Bertsekas-O'Connor-Vandenberghe), which enables efficient decentralized implementation and local stepsize adjustments. We establish robust convergence guarantees. Under mere convexity, the proposed methods converge with a sublinear rate. Under strong convexity of the sum-function, and assuming the nonsmooth component is partly smooth, we further prove linear convergence. Numerical experiments corroborate the theory and highlight the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive stepsize strategy.</description>

      <title>Learning to Stay Safe: Adaptive Regularization Against Safety Degradation during Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction-following language models are trained to be helpful and safe, yet their safety behavior can deteriorate under benign fine-tuning and worsen under adversarial updates. Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility.</description>

      <title>Optimal Unconstrained Self-Distillation in Ridge Regression: Strict Improvements, Precise Asymptotics, and One-Shot Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-distillation (SD) is the process of retraining a student on a mixture of ground-truth labels and the teacher's own predictions using the same architecture and training data. Although SD has been empirically shown to often improve generalization, its formal guarantees remain limited. We study SD for ridge regression in unconstrained setting in which the mixing weight $\xi$ may be outside the unit interval. Conditioned on the training data and without any distributional assumptions, we prove that for any squared prediction risk (including out-of-distribution), the optimally mixed student strictly improves upon the ridge teacher for every regularization level $\lambda &gt; 0$ at which the teacher ridge risk $R(\lambda)$ is nonstationary (i.e., $R'(\lambda) \neq 0$). We obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal mixing weight $\xi^\star(\lambda)$ for any value of $\lambda$ and show that it obeys the sign rule: $\operatorname{sign}(\xi^\star(\lambda))=-\operatorname{sign}(R'(\lambda))$. In particular, $\xi^\star(\lambda)$ can be negative, which is the case in over-regularized regimes. To quantify the risk improvement due to SD, we derive exact deterministic equivalents for the optimal SD risk in the proportional asymptotics regime (where the sample and feature sizes $n$ and $p$ both diverge but their aspect ratio $p/n$ converges) under general anisotropic covariance and deterministic signals. Our asymptotic analysis extends standard second-order ridge deterministic equivalents to their fourth-order analogs using block linearization, which may be of independent interest. From a practical standpoint, we propose a consistent one-shot tuning method to estimate $\xi^\star$ without grid search, sample splitting, or refitting. Experiments on real-world datasets and pretrained neural network features support our theory and the one-shot tuning method.</description>

We initiate the study of omniprediction in a multiclass setting, where the comparator family $\mathcal{C}$ may be infinite. Our main result is an extension of the recent binary omniprediction algorithm of [OKK25] to the multiclass setting, with sample complexity (in statistical settings) or regret horizon (in online settings) $\approx \varepsilon^{-(k+1)}$, for $\varepsilon$-omniprediction in a $k$-class prediction problem. En route to proving this result, we design a framework of potential broader interest for solving Blackwell approachability problems where multiple sets must simultaneously be approached via coupled actions.</description>

      <title>Conditional Flow Matching for Continuous Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving on a Manifold-Aware Spectral Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety validation for Level 4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) is currently bottlenecked by the inability to scale the detection of rare, high-risk long-tail scenarios using traditional rule-based heuristics. We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Sequential Testing with Markovian Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one-sided and $\alpha$-correct sequential hypothesis testing for data generated by an ergodic Markov chain. The null hypothesis is that the unknown transition matrix belongs to a prescribed set $P$ of stochastic matrices, and the alternative corresponds to a disjoint set $Q$. We establish a tight non-asymptotic instance-dependent lower bound on the expected stopping time of any valid sequential test under the alternative. Our novel analysis improves the existing lower bounds, which are either asymptotic or provably sub-optimal in this setting. Our lower bound incorporates both the stationary distribution and the transition structure induced by the unknown Markov chain. We further propose an optimal test whose expected stopping time matches this lower bound asymptotically as $\alpha \to 0$. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework through applications to sequential detection of model misspecification in Markov Chain Monte Carlo and to testing structural properties, such as the linearity of transition dynamics, in Markov decision processes. Our findings yield a sharp and general characterization of optimal sequential testing procedures under Markovian dependence.</description>

      <title>Adapting Actively on the Fly: Relevance-Guided Online Meta-Learning with Latent Concepts for Geospatial Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world settings, such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, or public health, with costly and difficult data collection and dynamic environments, strategically sampling from unobserved regions is essential for efficiently uncovering hidden targets under tight resource constraints. Yet, sparse and biased geospatial ground truth limits the applicability of existing learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning. To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments. Our experiments include testing on a real-world dataset of cancer-causing PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination, showcasing our method's reliability at uncovering targets with limited data and a varying environment.</description>

      <title>AutoNumerics: An Autonomous, PDE-Agnostic Multi-Agent Pipeline for Scientific Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PDEs are central to scientific and engineering modeling, yet designing accurate numerical solvers typically requires substantial mathematical expertise and manual tuning. Recent neural network-based approaches improve flexibility but often demand high computational cost and suffer from limited interpretability. We introduce \texttt{AutoNumerics}, a multi-agent framework that autonomously designs, implements, debugs, and verifies numerical solvers for general PDEs directly from natural language descriptions. Unlike black-box neural solvers, our framework generates transparent solvers grounded in classical numerical analysis. We introduce a coarse-to-fine execution strategy and a residual-based self-verification mechanism. Experiments on 24 canonical and real-world PDE problems demonstrate that \texttt{AutoNumerics} achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing neural and LLM-based baselines, and correctly selects numerical schemes based on PDE structural properties, suggesting its viability as an accessible paradigm for automated PDE solving.</description>

      <title>Mine and Refine: Optimizing Graded Relevance in E-commerce Search Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-stage "Mine and Refine" contrastive training framework for semantic text embeddings to enhance multi-category e-commerce search retrieval. Large scale e-commerce search demands embeddings that generalize to long tail, noisy queries while adhering to scalable supervision compatible with product and policy constraints. A practical challenge is that relevance is often graded: users accept substitutes or complements beyond exact matches, and production systems benefit from clear separation of similarity scores across these relevance strata for stable hybrid blending and thresholding. To obtain scalable policy consistent supervision, we fine-tune a lightweight LLM on human annotations under a three-level relevance guideline and further reduce residual noise via engagement driven auditing. In Stage 1, we train a multilingual Siamese two-tower retriever with a label aware supervised contrastive objective that shapes a robust global semantic space. In Stage 2, we mine hard samples via ANN and re-annotate them with the policy aligned LLM, and introduce a multi-class extension of circle loss that explicitly sharpens similarity boundaries between relevance levels, to further refine and enrich the embedding space. Robustness is additionally improved through additive spelling augmentation and synthetic query generation. Extensive offline evaluations and production A/B tests show that our framework improves retrieval relevance and delivers statistically significant gains in engagement and business impact.</description>

      <title>Sink-Aware Pruning for Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose ${\bf \texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute. Our code is available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Sink-Aware-Pruning.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation Scheme for Raman Spectra with Highly Correlated Annotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In biotechnology Raman Spectroscopy is rapidly gaining popularity as a process analytical technology (PAT) that measures cell densities, substrate- and product concentrations. As it records vibrational modes of molecules it provides that information non-invasively in a single spectrum. Typically, partial least squares (PLS) is the model of choice to infer information about variables of interest from the spectra. However, biological processes are known for their complexity where convolutional neural networks (CNN) present a powerful alternative. They can handle non-Gaussian noise and account for beam misalignment, pixel malfunctions or the presence of additional substances. However, they require a lot of data during model training, and they pick up non-linear dependencies in the process variables. In this work, we exploit the additive nature of spectra in order to generate additional data points from a given dataset that have statistically independent labels so that a network trained on such data exhibits low correlations between the model predictions. We show that training a CNN on these generated data points improves the performance on datasets where the annotations do not bear the same correlation as the dataset that was used for model training. This data augmentation technique enables us to reuse spectra as training data for new contexts that exhibit different correlations. The additional data allows for building a better and more robust model. This is of interest in scenarios where large amounts of historical data are available but are currently not used for model training. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method using synthetic spectra of Ralstonia eutropha batch cultivations to monitor substrate, biomass and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymer concentrations during of the experiments.</description>

      <title>Graph Machine Learning based Doubly Robust Estimator for Network Causal Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of inferring causal effects in social network data. This results in challenges due to interference -- where a unit's outcome is affected by neighbors' treatments -- and network-induced confounding factors. While there is extensive literature focusing on estimating causal effects in social network setups, a majority of them make prior assumptions about the form of network-induced confounding mechanisms. Such strong assumptions are rarely likely to hold especially in high-dimensional networks. We propose a novel methodology that combines graph machine learning approaches with the double machine learning framework to enable accurate and efficient estimation of direct and peer effects using a single observational social network. We demonstrate the semiparametric efficiency of our proposed estimator under mild regularity conditions, allowing for consistent uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate that our method is accurate, robust, and scalable via an extensive simulation study. We use our method to investigate the impact of Self-Help Group participation on financial risk tolerance.</description>

Abstract: We study gradient testing and gradient estimation of smooth functions using only a comparison oracle that, given two points, indicates which one has the larger function value. For any smooth $f\colon\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R$, $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb R^n$, and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we design a gradient testing algorithm that determines whether the normalized gradient $\nabla f(\mathbf{x})/\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x})\|$ is $\varepsilon$-close or $2\varepsilon$-far from a given unit vector $\mathbf{v}$ using $O(1)$ queries, as well as a gradient estimation algorithm that outputs an $\varepsilon$-estimate of $\nabla f(\mathbf{x})/\|\nabla f(\mathbf{x})\|$ using $O(n\log(1/\varepsilon))$ queries which we prove to be optimal. Furthermore, we study gradient estimation in the quantum comparison oracle model where queries can be made in superpositions, and develop a quantum algorithm using $O(\log (n/\varepsilon))$ queries.</description>

      <title>SeqRisk: Transformer-augmented latent variable model for robust survival prediction with longitudinal data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In healthcare, risk assessment of patient outcomes has been based on survival analysis for a long time, i.e. modeling time-to-event associations. However, conventional approaches rely on data from a single time-point, making them suboptimal for fully leveraging longitudinal patient history and capturing temporal regularities. Focusing on clinical real-world data and acknowledging its challenges, we utilize latent variable models to effectively handle irregular, noisy, and sparsely observed longitudinal data. We propose SeqRisk, a method that combines variational autoencoder (VAE) or longitudinal VAE (LVAE) with a transformer-based sequence aggregation and Cox proportional hazards module for risk prediction. SeqRisk captures long-range interactions, enhances predictive accuracy and generalizability, as well as provides partial explainability for sample population characteristics in attempts to identify high-risk patients. SeqRisk demonstrated robust performance under conditions of increasing sparsity, consistently surpassing existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Decision Making in Restless Bandits: Theory and Algorithms for Planning and Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In restless bandits, a central agent is tasked with optimally distributing limited resources across several bandits (arms), with each arm being a Markov decision process. In this work, we generalize the traditional restless bandits problem with a risk-neutral objective by incorporating risk-awareness, which is particularly important in various real-world applications especially when the decision maker seeks to mitigate downside risks. We establish indexability conditions for the case of a risk-aware objective and provide a solution based on Whittle index for the first time for the planning problem with finite-horizon non-stationary and for infinite-horizon stationary Markov decision processes. In addition, we address the learning problem when the true transition probabilities are unknown by proposing a Thompson sampling approach and show that it achieves bounded regret that scales sublinearly with the number of episodes and quadratically with the number of arms. The efficacy of our method in reducing risk exposure in restless bandits is illustrated through a set of numerical experiments in the contexts of machine replacement and patient scheduling applications under both planning and learning setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to control robotic systems such as drones, but their risks of causing physical threats and harm in real-world applications remain unexplored. Our study addresses the critical gap in evaluating LLM physical safety by developing a comprehensive benchmark for drone control. We classify the physical safety risks of drones into four categories: (1) human-targeted threats, (2) object-targeted threats, (3) infrastructure attacks, and (4) regulatory violations. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals an undesirable trade-off between utility and safety, with models that excel in code generation often performing poorly in crucial safety aspects. Furthermore, while incorporating advanced prompt engineering techniques such as In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought can improve safety, these methods still struggle to identify unintentional attacks. In addition, larger models demonstrate better safety capabilities, particularly in refusing dangerous commands. Our findings and benchmark can facilitate the design and evaluation of physical safety for LLMs. The project page is available at huggingface.co/spaces/TrustSafeAI/LLM-physical-safety.</description>

      <title>Point-DeepONet: Predicting Nonlinear Fields on Non-Parametric Geometries under Variable Load Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear structural analyses in engineering often require extensive finite element simulations, limiting their applicability in design optimization and real-time control. Conventional deep learning surrogates often struggle with complex, non-parametric three-dimensional (3D) geometries and directionally varying loads. This work presents Point-DeepONet, an operator-learning-based surrogate that integrates PointNet into the DeepONet framework to learn a mapping from non-parametric geometries and variable load conditions to physical response fields. By leveraging PointNet to learn a geometric representation from raw point clouds, our model circumvents the need for manual parameterization. This geometric embedding is then synergistically fused with load conditions within the DeepONet architecture to accurately predict three-dimensional displacement and von Mises stress fields. Trained on a large-scale dataset, Point-DeepONet demonstrates high fidelity, achieving a coefficient of determination (R^2) reaching 0.987 for displacement and 0.923 for von Mises stress. Furthermore, to rigorously validate its generalization capabilities, we conducted additional experiments on unseen, randomly oriented load directions, where the model maintained exceptional accuracy. Compared to nonlinear finite element analyses that require about 19.32 minutes per case, Point-DeepONet provides predictions in mere seconds--approximately 400 times faster--while maintaining excellent scalability. These findings, validated through extensive experiments and ablation studies, highlight the potential of Point-DeepONet to enable rapid, high-fidelity structural analyses for complex engineering workflows.</description>

In every round the leader observes contextual information and commits to a mixed strategy, after which the follower best-responds. We provide learning algorithms for the leader which achieve $O(T^{1/2})$ regret under bandit feedback, an improvement from the previously best-known rates of $O(T^{2/3})$. Our algorithms rely on a reduction to linear contextual bandits in the utility space: In each round, a linear contextual bandit algorithm recommends a utility vector, which our algorithm inverts to determine the leader's mixed strategy. We extend our algorithms to the setting in which the leader's utility function is unknown, and also apply it to the problems of bidding in second-price auctions with side information and online Bayesian persuasion with public and private states. Finally, we observe that our algorithms empirically outperform previous results on numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Self-Improving Skill Learning for Robust Skill-based Meta-Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03752v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) facilitates rapid adaptation to unseen tasks but faces challenges in long-horizon environments. Skill-based approaches tackle this by decomposing state-action sequences into reusable skills and employing hierarchical decision-making. However, these methods are highly susceptible to noisy offline demonstrations, leading to unstable skill learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Self-Improving Skill Learning (SISL), which performs self-guided skill refinement using decoupled high-level and skill improvement policies, while applying skill prioritization via maximum return relabeling to focus updates on task-relevant trajectories, resulting in robust and stable adaptation even under noisy and suboptimal data. By mitigating the effect of noise, SISL achieves reliable skill learning and consistently outperforms other skill-based meta-RL methods on diverse long-horizon tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/epsilog/SISL.</description>

      <title>Rex: A Family of Reversible Exponential (Stochastic) Runge-Kutta Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep generative models based on neural differential equations have quickly become the state-of-the-art for numerous generation tasks across many different applications. These models rely on ODE/SDE solvers which integrate from a prior distribution to the data distribution. In many applications it is highly desirable to then integrate in the other direction. The standard solvers, however, accumulate discretization errors which don't align with the forward trajectory, thereby prohibiting an exact inversion. In applications where the precision of the generative model is paramount this inaccuracy in inversion is often unacceptable. Current approaches to solving the inversion of these models results in significant downstream issues with poor stability and low-order of convergence; moreover, they are strictly limited to the ODE domain. In this work, we propose a new family of reversible exponential (stochastic) Runge-Kutta solvers which we refer to as Rex developed by an application of Lawson methods to convert any explicit (stochastic) Runge-Kutta scheme into a reversible one. In addition to a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed solvers, we also empirically demonstrate the utility of Rex on improving the sampling of Boltzmann distributions with flow models, and improving image generation and editing capabilities with diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Unlocking [CLS] Features for Continual Post-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning requires models to integrate new classes or domains over time while preserving previously acquired knowledge. Within this paradigm, foundation models often achieve strong performance, but they still remain subject to the stability-plasticity trade-off, where excessive plasticity leads to forgetting of prior knowledge, and excessive stability constrains the adaptation. This necessitates an effective post-training strategy that introduces minimal yet functional modifications. To address this challenge, we first introduce a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning module 'Learn and Calibrate', or LuCA, designed to acquire task-specific knowledge through an adapter-calibrator couple, enabling well-refined feature representations. Then, for each task, we deploy a sparse LuCA module on top of the last classification token [CLS] just before the classifier, which we refer to as 'Token-level Sparse Calibration and Adaptation', or TOSCA. By leaving the generalization capabilities of the foundation models intact and adapting exclusively via the last token, our approach achieves a harmonious balance between stability and plasticity while reducing both training and inference complexity. We demonstrate that TOSCA yields state-of-the-art performance while introducing ~8 times fewer parameters compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Orthogonal Fine-Tuning with Principal Subspace Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the rapid growth of model parameters, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become essential for adapting large models to diverse downstream tasks under constrained computational resources. Within this paradigm, orthogonal fine-tuning and its variants preserve semantic representations of pre-trained models, but struggle to achieve both expressiveness and efficiency in terms of parameter counts, memory, and computation. To overcome this limitation, we propose efficient Orthogonal Fine-Tuning with Principal Subspace adaptation (PSOFT), which confines orthogonal transformations to the principal subspace of pre-trained weights. Specifically, PSOFT constructs this subspace via matrix decomposition to enable compatible transformations with higher effective rank, establishes a theoretical condition that strictly maintains the geometry of this subspace for essential semantic preservation, and introduces efficient tunable vectors that gradually relax orthogonality during training to enhance adaptability. Extensive experiments on 35 NLP and CV tasks across four representative models demonstrate that PSOFT offers a practical and scalable solution to simultaneously achieve semantic preservation, expressiveness, and multi-dimensional efficiency in PEFT. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/fei407/PSOFT.</description>

      <title>Oversmoothing, Oversquashing, Heterophily, Long-Range, and more: Demystifying Common Beliefs in Graph Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After a renaissance phase in which researchers revisited the message-passing paradigm through the lens of deep learning, the graph machine learning community shifted its attention towards a deeper and practical understanding of message-passing's benefits and limitations. In this paper, we notice how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and oversquashing, the homophily-heterophily dichotomy, and long-range tasks, came with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions -- under the form of universal statements -- that are not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has led to ambiguities around the investigated problems, preventing researchers from focusing on and addressing precise research questions while causing a good amount of misunderstandings. Our contribution is to make such common beliefs explicit and encourage critical thinking around these topics, refuting universal statements via simple yet formally sufficient counterexamples. The end goal is to clarify conceptual differences, helping researchers address more clearly defined and targeted problems.</description>

      <title>On the Design of KL-Regularized Policy Gradient Algorithms for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17508v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective? We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a clipped-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO. We extend our experiments to 8K context length, and RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip achieves 52% accuracy on AIME25, surpassing the official Qwen3-4B-Instruct model (47%). Notably, RPG is a stable and scalable RL algorithm for LLM reasoning, realized via (a) a KL-correct objective, (b) clipped importance sampling, and (c) an iterative reference-policy update scheme.

      <title>Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17786v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a powerful self-supervised learning framework that performs data augmentation through graph perturbations, with growing applications in the analysis of biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). The artificial perturbations commonly used in GCL, such as node dropping, induce structural changes that can diverge from biological reality. This concern has contributed to a broader trend in graph representation learning toward augmentation-free methods, which view such structural changes as problematic and should be avoided. However, this trend overlooks the fundamental insight that structural changes from biologically meaningful perturbations are not a problem to be avoided, but rather a rich source of information, thereby ignoring the valuable opportunity to leverage data from real biological experiments. Motivated by this insight, we propose SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a new GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations from gene knockdown experiments as supervision. SupGCL is a probabilistic formulation that continuously generalizes conventional GCL, linking artificial augmentations with real perturbations measured in knockdown experiments, and using the latter as explicit supervision. On patient-derived GRNs from three cancer types, we train GRN representations with SupGCL and evaluate it in two regimes: (i) embedding space analysis, where it yields clearer disease-subtype structure and improves clustering, and (ii) task-specific fine-tuning, where it consistently outperforms strong graph representation learning baselines on 13 downstream tasks spanning gene-level functional annotation and patient-level prediction.</description>

      <title>GGBall: Graph Generative Model on Poincar\'e Ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating graphs with hierarchical structures remains a fundamental challenge due to the limitations of Euclidean geometry in capturing exponential complexity. Here we introduce \textbf{GGBall}, a novel hyperbolic framework for graph generation that integrates geometric inductive biases with modern generative paradigms. GGBall combines a Hyperbolic Vector-Quantized Autoencoder (HVQVAE) with a Riemannian flow matching prior defined via closed-form geodesics. This design enables flow-based priors to model complex latent distributions, while vector quantization helps preserve the curvature-aware structure of the hyperbolic space. We further develop a suite of hyperbolic GNN and Transformer layers that operate entirely within the manifold, ensuring stability and scalability. Empirically, our model reduces degree MMD by over 75\% on Community-Small and over 40\% on Ego-Small compared to state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating an improved ability to preserve topological hierarchies. These results highlight the potential of hyperbolic geometry as a powerful foundation for the generative modeling of complex, structured, and hierarchical data domains. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/GGBall}{here}.</description>

      <title>Two-Player Zero-Sum Games with Bandit Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14518v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-player zero-sum game in which the row player aims to maximize their payoff against a competing column player, under an unknown payoff matrix estimated through bandit feedback. We propose three algorithms based on the Explore-Then-Commit (ETC) and action pair elimination frameworks. The first adapts it to zero-sum games, the second incorporates adaptive elimination that leverages the $\varepsilon$-Nash Equilibrium property to efficiently select the optimal action pair, and the third extends the elimination algorithm by employing non-uniform exploration. Our objective is to demonstrate the applicability of ETC and action pair elimination algorithms in a zero-sum game setting by focusing on learning pure strategy Nash Equilibria. A key contribution of our work is a derivation of instance-dependent upper bounds on the expected regret of our proposed algorithms, which has received limited attention in the literature on zero-sum games. Particularly, after $T$ rounds, we achieve an instance-dependent regret upper bounds of $O(\Delta + \sqrt{T})$ for ETC in zero-sum game setting and $O\left(\frac{\log (T \Delta^2)}{\Delta}\right)$ for the adaptive elimination algorithm and its variant with non-uniform exploration, where $\Delta$ denotes the suboptimality gap. Therefore, our results indicate that the ETC and action pair elimination algorithms perform effectively in zero-sum game settings, achieving regret bounds comparable to existing methods while providing insight through instance-dependent analysis.</description>

      <title>Generating Directed Graphs with Dual Attention and Asymmetric Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directed graphs naturally model systems with asymmetric, ordered relationships, essential to applications in biology, transportation, social networks, and visual understanding. Generating such graphs enables tasks such as simulation, data augmentation and novel instance discovery; however, directed graph generation remains underexplored. We identify two key factors limiting progress in this direction: first, modeling edge directionality introduces a substantially larger dependency space, making the underlying distribution harder to learn; second, the absence of standardized benchmarks hinders rigorous evaluation. Addressing the former requires more expressive models that are sensitive to directional topologies. We propose Directo, the first generative model for directed graphs built upon the discrete flow matching framework. Our approach combines: (i) principled positional encodings tailored to asymmetric pairwise relations, (ii) a dual-attention mechanism capturing both incoming and outgoing dependencies, and (iii) a robust, discrete generative framework. To support evaluation, we introduce a benchmark suite covering synthetic and real-world datasets. It shows that our method performs strongly across diverse settings and even competes with specialized models for particular classes, such as directed acyclic graphs. Our results highlight the effectiveness and generality of our approach, establishing a solid foundation for future research in directed graph generation.</description>

      <title>Strict Subgoal Execution: Reliable Long-Horizon Planning in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions, their reliance on conventional hindsight relabeling often fails to correct subgoal infeasibility, leading to inefficient high-level planning. To address this, we propose Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL framework that integrates Frontier Experience Replay (FER) to separate unreachable from admissible subgoals and streamline high-level decision making. FER delineates the reachability frontier using failure and partial-success transitions, which identifies unreliable subgoals, increases subgoal reliability, and reduces unnecessary high-level decisions. Additionally, SSE employs a decoupled exploration policy to cover underexplored regions of the goal space and a path refinement that adjusts edge costs using observed low-level failures. Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks show that SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL methods in both efficiency and success rate.

      <description>arXiv:2507.05411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AXLearn is a production system which facilitates scalable and high-performance training of large deep learning models. Compared to other state-of-art deep learning systems, AXLearn has a unique focus on modularity and support for hardware-agnostic training. AXLearn's internal interfaces between software components follow strict encapsulation, allowing different components to be assembled to facilitate rapid model development and experimentation on different hardware infrastructure. AXLearn maintains constant complexity as we scale the components in the system, compared to linear or quadratic complexity in state-of-the-art training systems. This allows integrating features such as Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) into AXLearn across hundred of modules with just 10 lines of code, compared to hundreds as required in other systems. At the same time, AXLearn maintains equivalent performance compared to state-of-the-art training systems. Finally, we share our experience in the development and operation of AXLearn at Apple.</description>

      <title>Instance-Wise Adaptive Sampling for Dataset Construction in Approximating Inverse Problem Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title>

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description>

      <title>Slicing Wasserstein Over Wasserstein Via Functional Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional $L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models (DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a &gt;99% true positive rate with minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.</description>

      <title>Entropy After $\langle \texttt{/Think} \rangle$ for reasoning model early exiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning LLMs show improved performance with longer chains of thought. However, recent work has highlighted their tendency to overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency from the distribution dynamics perspective by tracking Pass@1 for answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find the model often begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making extra reasoning tokens wasteful. To detect and prevent overthinking, we propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal, Entropy After &lt;/Think&gt; (EAT), for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a stop thinking token (&lt;/think&gt;) and monitoring the entropy of the following token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token usage by 12 - 22% without harming accuracy. EAT also remains effective in black box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT is computed with proxy models: We verified the feasibility via early stopping Llama 70B with a 1.5B model and Claude 3.7 with a local 4B model.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Prompt Optimization: Why Not Leverage Multiple Modalities for MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images, videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>ArtNet: Hierarchical Clustering-Based Artificial Netlist Generator for ML and DTCO Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters, ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original (real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of targeted full-scale block designs.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Diffusion Alignment: Learning Structured Latents for Controllable Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are high dimensional and not explicitly organized for interpretation or control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment), a plug-and-play geometry layer that applies contrastive learning to pretrained diffusion latents using auxiliary variables (e.g., time, stimulation parameters, facial action units). ConDA learns a low-dimensional embedding whose directions align with underlying dynamical factors, consistent with recent contrastive learning results on structured and disentangled representations. In this embedding, simple nonlinear trajectories support smooth interpolation, extrapolation, and counterfactual editing while rendering remains in the original diffusion space. ConDA separates editing and rendering by lifting embedding trajectories back to diffusion latents with a neighborhood-preserving kNN decoder and is robust across inversion solvers. Across fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, facial expression dynamics, and monkey motor cortex activity, ConDA yields more interpretable and controllable latent structure than linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines, indicating that diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure that can be exploited by an explicit contrastive geometry layer.</description>

      <title>pi-Flow: Policy-Based Few-Step Generation via Imitation Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep. The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming previous 1-NFE models of the same DiT architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art DMD models, while maintaining teacher-level quality.</description>

      <title>Alternatives to the Laplacian for Scalable Spectral Clustering with Group Fairness Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness (balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm. Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet, Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as much balance.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Mobile Inference through Fine-Grained CPU-GPU Co-Execution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand, their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory (SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times. Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and 1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).</description>

      <title>LRT-Diffusion: Calibrated Risk-Aware Guidance for Diffusion Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL) but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget. Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline RL.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization with Limited Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of preference optimization has made outstanding contributions to the alignment of language models with human preferences. Despite these advancements, recent methods still rely heavily on substantial paired (labeled) feedback data, leading to substantial resource expenditures. To address these challenges, we study the problem of Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) in which the idea is to learn from both a small number of pairwise preference labels and a large pool of unpaired samples simultaneously. Our key theoretical contribution proves the existence of an optimal reward threshold capable of separating winning and losing responses with high probability, which enables a principled pseudo-labeling of unpaired data. By leveraging these pseudo-labels, SSPO effectively distills latent preferences from large-scale unpaired data, thus maintaining human alignment while drastically reducing acquisition costs. Extensive experiments across datasets validate this remarkable data efficiency; for instance, SSPO trained with Mistral-7B-Instruct on just 1% of UltraFeedback consistently surpasses strong baselines trained on 10% of UltraFeedback.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models with Intrinsic Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning ability of large language models, yet training remains costly because many rollouts contribute little to optimization, considering the amount of computation required. This study investigates how simply leveraging intrinsic data properties, almost free benefit during training, can improve data efficiency for RLVR. We propose PREPO with two complementary components. First, we adopt prompt perplexity as an indicator of model adaptability in learning, enabling the model to progress from well-understood contexts to more challenging ones. Second, we amplify the discrepancy among the rollouts by differentiating their relative entropy, and prioritize sequences that exhibit a higher degree of exploration. Together, these mechanisms reduce rollout demand while preserving competitive performance. On the Qwen and Llama models, PREPO achieves effective results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with up to 3 times fewer rollouts than the baselines. Beyond empirical gains, we provide theoretical and in-depth analyses explaining the underlying rationale of our method to improve the data efficiency of RLVR.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Surrogates: High-Fidelity Local Explanations for Black-Box Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of black-box machine learning models and their adoption in high-stakes areas, it is critical to provide explanations for their predictions. Existing local explanation methods lack in generating high-fidelity explanations. This paper proposes a novel local model agnostic explanation method to generate high-fidelity explanations using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and N-ball sampling strategies. MARS is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity. The N-ball sampling technique samples perturbed samples directly from a desired distribution instead of reweighting, leading to further improvement in the faithfulness. The performance of the proposed method was computed in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) and evaluated on five different benchmark datasets with different kernel width. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher local surrogate fidelity compared to baseline local explanation methods, with an average reduction of 32% in root mean square error, indicating more accurate local approximations of the black-box model. Additionally, statistical analysis shows that across all benchmark datasets, the proposed approach results were statistically significantly better. This paper advances the field of explainable AI by providing insights that can benefit the broader research and practitioner community.</description>

      <title>Online Robust Reinforcement Learning with General Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-world settings, reinforcement learning systems suffer performance degradation when the environment encountered at deployment differs from that observed during training. Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DR-RL) mitigates this issue by seeking policies that maximize performance under the most adverse transition dynamics within a prescribed uncertainty set. Most existing DR-RL approaches, however, rely on strong data availability assumptions, such as access to a generative model or large offline datasets, and are largely restricted to tabular settings.
  In this work, we propose a fully online DR-RL algorithm with general function approximation that learns robust policies solely through interaction, without requiring prior knowledge or pre-collected data. Our approach is based on a dual-driven fitted robust Bellman procedure that simultaneously estimates the value function and the corresponding worst-case backup operator. We establish regret guarantees for online DR-RL characterized by an intrinsic complexity notion, the robust Bellman-Eluder dimension, covering a broad class of phi-divergence uncertainty sets. The resulting regret bounds are sublinear, do not scale with the size of the state or action spaces, and specialize to tight rates in structured problem classes, demonstrating the practicality and scalability of our framework.</description>

      <title>On the Existence and Behavior of Secondary Attention Sinks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attention sinks are tokens, often the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token, that receive disproportionately high attention despite limited semantic relevance. In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.</description>

      <title>On the Sample Complexity of Learning for Blind Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blind inverse problems arise in many experimental settings where the forward operator is partially or entirely unknown. In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide a theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results of the reconstruction error under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning to Discover a North-East Monsoon Index for Rainfall Prediction in Thailand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10181v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting long-term rainfall is challenging. Global climate indices, such as the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for machine learning. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel North-East monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.</description>

      <title>Learning PDE Solvers with Physics and Data: A Unifying View of Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to scientific modeling. Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Decision Trees with Provable Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper advances the theoretical understanding of active learning label complexity for decision trees as binary classifiers. We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions. Finally, we establish a label complexity lower bound, showing our algorithm's dependence on the error tolerance $\epsilon$ is close to optimal.</description>

      <title>Temporal Graph Pattern Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal graph learning is pivotal for deciphering dynamic systems, where the core challenge lies in explicitly modeling the underlying evolving patterns that govern network transformation. However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability. Our code has been released in https://github.com/antman9914/TGPM.</description>

      <title>The Chicken and Egg Dilemma: Co-optimizing Data and Model Configurations for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Co-optimizing data and model configurations for training LLMs presents a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma: The best training data configuration (e.g., data mixture) for a downstream task depends on the chosen model configuration (e.g., model architecture), and vice versa. However, jointly optimizing both data and model configurations is often deemed intractable, and existing methods focus on either data or model optimization without considering their interaction. We introduce JoBS, an approach that uses a scaling-law-inspired performance predictor to aid Bayesian optimization (BO) in jointly optimizing LLM training data and model configurations efficiently. JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs. We study JoBS's average regret and devise the optimal budget allocation to minimize regret. JoBS outperforms existing multi-fidelity BO baselines, as well as data and model optimization approaches across diverse LLM tasks under the same optimization budget.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Guided Pretraining for Brain Graph Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing interest in foundation models for brain signals, graph-based pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for learning transferable representations from connectome data. However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions. Extensive experiments across multiple neuroimaging datasets with over 25,000 subjects and 60,000 scans involving various mental disorders and brain atlases demonstrate consistent performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Biases in the Blind Spot: Detecting What LLMs Fail to Mention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces that appear plausible, but may hide internal biases. We call these *unverbalized biases*. Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across seven LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity). More broadly, our proposed approach provides a practical, scalable path to automatic task-specific bias discovery.</description>

      <title>Universal Diffusion-Based Probabilistic Downscaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a universal diffusion-based downscaling framework that lifts deterministic low-resolution weather forecasts into probabilistic high-resolution predictions without any model-specific fine-tuning. A single conditional diffusion model is trained on paired coarse-resolution inputs (~25 km resolution) and high-resolution regional reanalysis targets (~5 km resolution), and is applied in a fully zero-shot manner to deterministic forecasts from heterogeneous upstream weather models. Focusing on near-surface variables, we evaluate probabilistic forecasts against independent in situ station observations over lead times up to 90 h. Across a diverse set of AI-based and numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, the ensemble mean of the downscaled forecasts consistently improves upon each model's own raw deterministic forecast, and substantially larger gains are observed in probabilistic skill as measured by CRPS. These results demonstrate that diffusion-based downscaling provides a scalable, model-agnostic probabilistic interface for enhancing spatial resolution and uncertainty representation in operational weather forecasting pipelines.</description>

      <title>Logit Distance Bounds Representational Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a broad family of discriminative models that includes autoregressive language models, identifiability results imply that if two models induce the same conditional distributions, then their internal representations agree up to an invertible linear transformation. We ask whether an analogous conclusion holds approximately when the distributions are close instead of equal. Building on the observation of Nielsen et al. (2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts. In distillation experiments on synthetic and image datasets, logit-distance distillation yields students with higher linear representational similarity and better preservation of the teacher's linearly recoverable concepts.</description>

      <title>Omni-iEEG: A Large-Scale, Comprehensive iEEG Dataset and Benchmark for Epilepsy Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research. The project page with dataset and code links is available at omni-ieeg.github.io/omni-ieeg.</description>

      <title>HPMixer: Hierarchical Patching for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-free Adaptive Resonance Theory-based Topological Clustering Algorithm Capable of Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general, a similarity threshold (i.e., a vigilance parameter) for a node learning process in Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)-based algorithms has a significant impact on clustering performance. In addition, an edge deletion threshold in a topological clustering algorithm plays an important role in adaptively generating well-separated clusters during a self-organizing process. In this paper, we propose an ART-based topological clustering algorithm that integrates parameter estimation methods for both the similarity threshold and the edge deletion threshold. The similarity threshold is estimated using a determinantal point process-based criterion, while the edge deletion threshold is defined based on the age of edges. Experimental results with synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm has superior clustering performance to state-of-the-art clustering algorithms without requiring parameter specifications specific to the datasets.

      <title>A Parametric Contextual Online Learning Theory of Brokerage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the role of contextual information in the online learning problem of brokerage between traders. In this sequential problem, at each time step, two traders arrive with secret valuations about an asset they wish to trade. The learner (a broker) suggests a trading (or brokerage) price based on contextual data about the asset and the market conditions. Then, the traders reveal their willingness to buy or sell based on whether their valuations are higher or lower than the brokerage price. A trade occurs if one of the two traders decides to buy and the other to sell, i.e., if the broker's proposed price falls between the smallest and the largest of their two valuations. We design algorithms for this problem and prove optimal theoretical regret guarantees under various standard assumptions.</description>

      <title>Input-Label Correlation Governs a Linear-to-Nonlinear Transition in Random Features under Spiked Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random feature models (RFMs), two-layer networks with a randomly initialized fixed first layer and a trained linear readout, are among the simplest nonlinear predictors. Prior asymptotic analyses in the proportional high-dimensional regime show that, under isotropic data, RFMs reduce to noisy linear models and offer no advantage over classical linear methods such as ridge regression. Yet RFMs frequently outperform linear baselines on structured real data. We show that this tension is explained by a correlation-driven phase transition: under spiked-covariance designs, the interaction between anisotropy and input-label correlation determines whether the RFM behaves as an effectively linear predictor or exhibits genuinely nonlinear gains. Concretely, we establish a universality principle under anisotropy and characterize the RFM generalization error via an equivalent noisy polynomial model. The effective degree of this polynomial, equivalently, which Hermite orders of the activation survive, is governed by the strength of input-label correlation, yielding an explicit boundary in the correlation-spike-magnitude plane. Below the boundary, the RFM collapses to a linear surrogate and can underperform strong linear baselines; above it, higher-order terms persist and the RFM achieves a clear nonlinear advantage. Numerical simulations and real-data experiments corroborate the theory and delineate the transition between these two regimes.</description>

      <title>Goal Inference from Open-Ended Dialog</title>

Abstract: Embodied AI Agents are quickly becoming important and common tools in society. These embodied agents should be able to learn about and accomplish a wide range of user goals and preferences efficiently and robustly. Large Language Models (LLMs) are often used as they allow for opportunities for rich and open-ended dialog type interaction between the human and agent to accomplish tasks according to human preferences. In this thesis, we argue that for embodied agents that deal with open-ended dialog during task assistance: 1) AI Agents should extract goals from conversations in the form of Natural Language (NL) to be better at capturing human preferences as it is intuitive for humans to communicate their preferences on tasks to agents through natural language. 2) AI Agents should quantify/maintain uncertainty about these goals to ensure that actions are being taken according to goals that the agent is extremely certain about. We present an online method for embodied agents to learn and accomplish diverse user goals. While offline methods like RLHF can represent various goals but require large datasets, our approach achieves similar flexibility with online efficiency. We extract natural language goal representations from conversations with Large Language Models (LLMs). We prompt an LLM to role play as a human with different goals and use the corresponding likelihoods to run Bayesian inference over potential goals. As a result, our method can represent uncertainty over complex goals based on unrestricted dialog. We evaluate in a text-based grocery shopping domain and an AI2Thor robot simulation. We compare our method to ablation baselines that lack either explicit goal representation or probabilistic inference.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample performance of the maximum likelihood estimator in logistic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logistic regression is a classical model for describing the probabilistic dependence of binary responses to multivariate covariates. We consider the predictive performance of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for logistic regression, assessed in terms of logistic risk. We consider two questions: first, that of the existence of the MLE (which occurs when the dataset is not linearly separated), and second, that of its accuracy when it exists. These properties depend on both the dimension of covariates and the signal strength. In the case of Gaussian covariates and a well-specified logistic model, we obtain sharp non-asymptotic guarantees for the existence and excess logistic risk of the MLE. We then generalize these results in two ways: first, to non-Gaussian covariates satisfying a certain two-dimensional margin condition, and second to the general case of statistical learning with a possibly misspecified logistic model. Finally, we consider the case of a Bernoulli design, where the behavior of the MLE is highly sensitive to the parameter direction.</description>

Abstract: Large Foundation Models like Dust3r can produce high quality outputs such as pointmaps, camera intrinsics, and depth estimation, given stereo-image pairs as input. However, the application of these outputs on tasks like Visual Localization requires a large amount of inference time and compute resources. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose the use of a knowledge distillation pipeline, where we aim to build a student-teacher model with Dust3r as the teacher and explore multiple architectures of student models that are trained using the 3D reconstructed points output by Dust3r. Our goal is to build student models that can learn scene-specific representations and output 3D points with replicable performance such as Dust3r. The data set we used to train our models is 12Scenes. We test two main architectures of models: a CNN-based architecture and a Vision Transformer based architecture. For each architecture, we also compare the use of pre-trained models against models built from scratch. We qualitatively compare the reconstructed 3D points output by the student model against Dust3r's and discuss the various features learned by the student model. We also perform ablation studies on the models through hyperparameter tuning. Overall, we observe that the Vision Transformer presents the best performance visually and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Efficient Context Propagating Perceiver Architectures for Auto-Regressive Language Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key challenges in Transformer architectures is the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, which limits the efficient processing of long sequences. Many recent research works have attempted to provide a reduction from the $O(n^2)$ time complexity of attention to semi-linear complexity. However, it remains an unsolved problem in the sense of maintaining high performance when complexity is reduced. One of the important works in this respect is the Perceiver class of architectures that have demonstrated excellent performance, while reducing the computation complexity. In this paper, we use the PerceiverAR as a basis and explore the design space of different trade-offs between preserving context and reducing attention complexity. To this end, we develop four new architectural paradigms, the best performing of which we denote as the Efficient Context propagating Perceiver (ECP). ECP has two major advantages over the PerceiverAR. First, the ECP architecture overcomes the main drawback of PercieverAR by utilizing both the context and the latent sequences in autoregressive training. Second, the ECP architecture operates with the same attention complexity as LongLoRA, making it computationally efficient. More importantly, via pairwise segment attention, it extracts better information resulting in improved language modeling. Empirically, we demonstrate that the ECP architecture significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art Transformer models on Wikitext-103, PG-19 and sCIFAR-10.</description>

Abstract: Dataset curation has become a basis for strong large language model (LLM) performance. While various rule-based filtering heuristics exist for English and multilingual datasets, model-based filtering techniques have primarily focused on English. To address the disparity stemming from limited research on non-English languages, we develop a model-based filtering framework for multilingual datasets that aims to identify a diverse set of structured and knowledge-rich samples. Our approach emphasizes transparency, simplicity, and efficiency, leveraging Transformer- and FastText-based classifiers to ensure the broad accessibility of our technique and data. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the FineWeb-2 web crawl dataset across diverse language families, scripts, and resource availability to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Training a 1B-parameter Llama model for 70B and 119B tokens, our approach can match the baseline MMLU score with as little as 15% of the training tokens, while also improving across other benchmarks and mitigating the curse of multilinguality. These findings provide strong evidence for the generalizability of our approach to other languages. As a result, we extend our framework to 20 languages for which we release the refined pretraining datasets.</description>

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various vision tasks. However, they tend to underperform on smaller datasets due to their inherent lack of inductive biases. Current approaches address this limitation implicitly-often by pairing ViTs with pretext tasks or by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to strengthen the prior. In contrast, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a widely adopted self-supervised framework, are inherently structured to preserve topology and spatial organization, making them a promising candidate to directly address the limitations of ViTs in limited or small training datasets. Despite this potential, equipping SOMs with modern deep learning architectures remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a novel exploration on how Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can empower each other, aiming to bridge this critical research gap. Our findings demonstrate that these architectures can synergistically enhance each other, leading to significantly improved performance in both unsupervised and supervised tasks.

      <title>Capturing Individual Human Preferences with Reward Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback usually models preferences using a reward function that does not distinguish between people. We argue that this is unlikely to be a good design choice in contexts with high potential for disagreement, like in the training of large language models. We formalise and analyse the problem of learning a reward model that can be specialised to a user. Using the principle of empirical risk minimisation, we derive a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound showing the dependency of the approximation error on the number of training examples, as usual, and also on the number of human raters who provided feedback on them. Based on our theoretical findings, we discuss how to best collect pairwise preference data and argue that adaptive reward models should be beneficial when there is considerable disagreement among users. We also propose a concrete architecture for an adaptive reward model. Our approach leverages the observation that individual preferences can be captured as a linear combination of a set of general reward features. We show how to learn such features and subsequently use them to quickly adapt the reward model to a specific individual, even if their preferences are not reflected in the training data. We present experiments with large language models illustrating our theoretical results and comparing the proposed architecture with a non-adaptive baseline. Consistent with our analysis, the benefits provided by our model increase with the number of raters and the heterogeneity of their preferences. We also show that our model compares favourably to adaptive counterparts, including those performing in-context personalisation.</description>

      <title>Cert-SSBD: Certified Backdoor Defense with Sample-Specific Smoothing Noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an attacker manipulates a small portion of the training data to implant hidden backdoors into the model. The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary. However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples. To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/Cert-SSB.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Framework for Robust and Efficient Inference with Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To analyze unstructured data (text, images, audio, video), economists typically first extract low-dimensional structured features with a neural network. Neural networks do not make generically unbiased predictions, and biases will propagate to estimators that use their predictions. While structured variables extracted from unstructured data have traditionally been treated as proxies - implicitly accepting arbitrary measurement error - this poses various challenges in an era where constantly evolving AI can cheaply extract data. Researcher degrees of freedom (e.g., the choice of neural network architecture, training data or prompts, and numerous implementation details) raise concerns about p-hacking and how to best show robustness, the frequent deprecation of proprietary neural networks complicates reproducibility, and researchers need a principled way to determine how accurate predictions need to be before making costly investments to improve them. To address these challenges, this study develops MAR-S (Missing At Random Structured Data), a semiparametric missing data framework that enables unbiased, efficient, and robust inference with unstructured data, by correcting for neural network prediction error with a validation sample. MAR-S synthesizes and extends existing methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions and connects them to familiar problems such as causal inference, highlighting valuable parallels. We develop robust and efficient estimators for both descriptive and causal estimands and address inference with aggregated and transformed neural network predictions, a common scenario outside the existing literature.</description>

      <title>ReplaceMe: Network Simplification via Depth Pruning and Transformer Block Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02819v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation, which approximates the pruned blocks. The estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25\% pruning while retaining approximately 90\% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead. We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at https://github.com/mts-ai/ReplaceMe</description>

      <title>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium maximum entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</description>

      <title>LLM Fingerprinting via Semantically Conditioned Watermarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most LLM fingerprinting methods teach the model to respond to a few fixed queries with predefined atypical responses (keys). This memorization often does not survive common deployment steps such as finetuning or quantization, and such keys can be easily detected and filtered from LLM responses, ultimately breaking the fingerprint. To overcome these limitations we introduce LLM fingerprinting via semantically conditioned watermarks, replacing fixed query sets with a broad semantic domain, and replacing brittle atypical keys with a statistical watermarking signal diffused throughout each response. After teaching the model to watermark its responses only to prompts from a predetermined domain e.g., French language, the model owner can use queries from that domain to reliably detect the fingerprint and verify ownership. As we confirm in our thorough experimental evaluation, our fingerprint is both stealthy and robust to all common deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beyond Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack: Environment, Architecture, and Training Considerations for Long Context Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks that advances long-context understanding in embodied AI. $\infty$-THOR provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible, and unlimited long-horizon trajectories; (2) a novel embodied QA task, Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack, where multiple scattered clues across extended trajectories test agents' long-context reasoning ability; and (3) a long-horizon dataset and benchmark suite featuring complex tasks that span hundreds of environment steps, each paired with ground-truth action sequences. To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.</description>

      <title>Persona-driven Simulation of Voting Behavior in the European Parliament with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or even produce political discourse but have been found to consistently exhibit a progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic groups with which the base model is not aligned. In this work, we analyze whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict the positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate whether predictions are stable in response to counterfactual arguments, different persona prompts, and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate the voting behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well, achieving a weighted F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024 European Parliament and our code are available at the following url: https://github.com/dess-mannheim/european_parliament_simulation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Dynamical Systems in Process Engineering: Review and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate dynamical models are a key requirement for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a comparison of method characteristics. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for chemical process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As machine learning manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction, i.e., reduction of floating point operations. Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{SPECS}$: Faster Test-Time Scaling through Speculative Drafts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has driven the recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically by allocating additional computation for more thorough exploration. However, increased compute often comes at the expense of higher user-facing latency, directly impacting user experience. Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $\texttt{SPECS}$, a latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding. $\texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based deferral mechanism. Empirical results on MATH500, AMC23 and OlympiadBench datasets show that $\texttt{SPECS}$~matches or surpasses beam search accuracy while reducing latency by up to $\sim$19.1\%. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm converges to the solution of a KL-regularized reinforcement learning objective with increasing beam width.</description>

      <title>Bongard-RWR+: Real-World Representations of Fine-Grained Concepts in Bongard Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Ringleader ASGD: The First Asynchronous SGD with Optimal Time Complexity under Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asynchronous stochastic gradient methods are central to scalable distributed optimization, particularly when devices differ in computational capabilities. Such settings arise naturally in federated learning, where training takes place on smartphones and other heterogeneous edge devices. In addition to varying computation speeds, these devices often hold data from different distributions. However, existing asynchronous SGD methods struggle in such heterogeneous settings and face two key limitations. First, many rely on unrealistic assumptions of similarity across workers' data distributions. Second, methods that relax this assumption still fail to achieve theoretically optimal performance under heterogeneous computation times. We introduce Ringleader ASGD, the first asynchronous SGD algorithm that attains the theoretical lower bounds for parallel first-order stochastic methods in the smooth nonconvex regime, thereby achieving optimal time complexity under data heterogeneity and without restrictive similarity assumptions. Our analysis further establishes that Ringleader ASGD remains optimal under arbitrary and even time-varying worker computation speeds, closing a fundamental gap in the theory of asynchronous optimization.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Search Using Side Information for Diffusion-Based Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely used as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search algorithm that guides the sampling process using side information. Our framework can be added to existing diffusion-based reconstruction pipelines in a plug-and-play manner, without requiring any training. Through extensive experiments across a range of inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, and several deblurring tasks, and across multiple diffusion-based inverse problem solvers (DPS, DAPS, and MPGD), we show that augmenting each solver with our framework consistently improves the quality of the reconstructions over the corresponding original method. In order to demonstrate the generality of our approach, we consider diverse forms of side information, including reference images, textual descriptions, and anatomical MRI scans. We also show that our search-based approach outperforms other ways of incorporating side information, including reward gradient-based method. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/mahdi-farahbakhsh/DISS}{here}.</description>

      <title>LayerSync: Self-aligning Intermediate Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient, plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/LayerSync.</description>

      <title>Toward LLM-Supported Automated Assessment of Critical Thinking Subskills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the world becomes increasingly saturated with AI-generated content, disinformation, and algorithmic persuasion, critical thinking - the capacity to evaluate evidence, detect unreliable claims, and exercise independent judgment - is becoming a defining human skill. Developing critical thinking skills through timely assessment and feedback is crucial; however, there has not been extensive work in educational data mining on defining, measuring, and supporting critical thinking. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of measuring "subskills" that underlie critical thinking. We ground our work in an authentic task where students operationalize critical thinking by writing argumentative essays. We developed a coding rubric based on an established skills progression and completed human coding for a corpus of student essays. We then evaluated three distinct approaches to automated scoring: zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and supervised fine-tuning, implemented across three large language models (GPT-5, Llama 3.1 8B, and ModernBERT). Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B achieved the best results and demonstrated particular strength on subskills with highly separable proficiency levels with balanced labels across levels, while lower performance was observed for subskills that required detection of subtle distinctions between proficiency levels or imbalanced labels. Our exploratory work represents an initial step toward scalable assessment of critical thinking skills across authentic educational contexts. Future research should continue to combine automated critical thinking assessment with human validation to more accurately detect and measure dynamic, higher-order thinking skills.</description>

Abstract: Given the significant advances in machine learning techniques on mobile devices, particularly in the domain of computer vision, in this work we quantitatively study the performance characteristics of 190 real-world vision transformers (ViTs) on mobile devices. Through a comparison with 102 real-world convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we provide insights into the factors that influence the latency of ViT architectures on mobile devices. Based on these insights, we develop a dataset including measured latencies of 1000 synthetic ViTs with representative building blocks and state-of-the-art architectures from two machine learning frameworks and six mobile platforms. Using this dataset, we show that inference latency of new ViTs can be predicted with sufficient accuracy for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Wireless Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless foundation models (WFMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities, jointly performing multiple wireless functions and adapting effectively to new environments. However, while current WFMs process only one modality, depending on the task and operating conditions, the most informative modality changes and no single modality is best for all tasks. WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities. We believe this provides a concrete step toward both AI-native 6G and the vision of joint sensing, communication, and localization.</description>

However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel "free-lunch" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings.</description>

      <title>Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19941v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent runtime. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.</description>

      <title>Puzzle it Out: Local-to-Global World Model for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.</description>

      <title>Beyond Predictive Uncertainty: Reliable Representation Learning with Structural Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation in machine learning has traditionally focused on the prediction stage, aiming to quantify confidence in model outputs while treating learned representations as deterministic and reliable by default. In this work, we challenge this implicit assumption and argue that reliability should be regarded as a first-class property of learned representations themselves. We propose a principled framework for reliable representation learning that explicitly models representation-level uncertainty and leverages structural constraints as inductive biases to regularize the space of feasible representations. Our approach introduces uncertainty-aware regularization directly in the representation space, encouraging representations that are not only predictive but also stable, well-calibrated, and robust to noise and structural perturbations. Structural constraints, such as sparsity, relational structure, or feature-group dependencies, are incorporated to define meaningful geometry and reduce spurious variability in learned representations, without assuming fully correct or noise-free structure. Importantly, the proposed framework is independent of specific model architectures and can be integrated with a wide range of representation learning methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for implementing an optical neural network using only linear optical resources, namely field displacement and interferometry applied to coherent states of light. The nonlinearity required for learning in a neural network is realized via an encoding of the input into phase shifts allowing for far more straightforward experimental implementation compared to previous proposals for, and demonstrations of, $\textit{in situ}$ inference. Beyond $\textit{in situ}$ inference, the method enables $\textit{in situ}$ training by utilizing established techniques like parameter shift rules or physical backpropagation to extract gradients directly from measurements of the linear optical circuit. We also investigate the effect of photon losses and find the model to be very resilient to these.</description>

      <title>Beyond In-Domain Detection: SpikeScore for Cross-Domain Hallucination Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19245v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs' initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.</description>

      <title>Fixed Budget is No Harder Than Fixed Confidence in Best-Arm Identification up to Logarithmic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The best-arm identification (BAI) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in interactive machine learning, which has two flavors: the fixed-budget setting (FB) and the fixed-confidence setting (FC).
  For $K$-armed bandits with the unique best arm, the optimal sample complexities for both settings have been settled down, and they match up to logarithmic factors.
  This prompts an interesting research question about the generic, potentially structured BAI problems: Is FB harder than FC or the other way around?
  In this paper, we show that FB is no harder than FC up to logarithmic factors.
  We do this constructively: we propose a novel algorithm called FC2FB (fixed confidence to fixed budget), which is a meta algorithm that takes in an FC algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ and turn it into an FB algorithm.
  We prove that this FC2FB enjoys a sample complexity that matches, up to logarithmic factors, that of the sample complexity of $\mathcal{A}$.
  This means that the optimal FC sample complexity is an upper bound of the optimal FB sample complexity up to logarithmic factors.
  Our result not only reveals a fundamental relationship between FB and FC, but also has a significant implication: FC2FB, combined with existing state-of-the-art FC algorithms, leads to improved sample complexity for a number of FB problems.</description>

      <title>Universal Coefficients and Mayer-Vietoris Sequence for Groupoid Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study homology of ample groupoids via the compactly supported Moore complex of the nerve. Let $A$ be a topological abelian group. For $n\ge 0$ set $C_n(\mathcal G;A) := C_c(\mathcal G_n,A)$ and define $\partial_n^A=\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i(d_i)_*$. This defines $H_n(\mathcal G;A)$. The theory is functorial for continuous \'etale homomorphisms. It is compatible with standard reductions, including restriction to saturated clopen subsets. In the ample setting it is invariant under Kakutani equivalence. We reprove Matui type long exact sequences and identify the comparison maps at chain level. For discrete $A$ we prove a natural universal coefficient short exact sequence $$0\to H_n(\mathcal G)\otimes_{\mathbb Z}A\xrightarrow{\ \iota_n^{\mathcal G}\ }H_n(\mathcal G;A)\xrightarrow{\ \kappa_n^{\mathcal G}\ }\operatorname{Tor}_1^{\mathbb Z}\bigl(H_{n-1}(\mathcal G),A\bigr)\to 0.$$ The key input is the chain level isomorphism $C_c(\mathcal G_n,\mathbb Z)\otimes_{\mathbb Z}A\cong C_c(\mathcal G_n,A)$, which reduces the groupoid statement to the classical algebraic UCT for the free complex $C_c(\mathcal G_\bullet,\mathbb Z)$. We also isolate the obstruction for non-discrete coefficients. For a locally compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space $X$ with a basis of compact open sets, the image of $\Phi_X:C_c(X,\mathbb Z)\otimes_{\mathbb Z}A\to C_c(X,A)$ is exactly the compactly supported functions with finite image. Thus $\Phi_X$ is surjective if and only if every $f\in C_c(X,A)$ has finite image, and for suitable $X$ one can produce compactly supported continuous maps $X\to A$ with infinite image. Finally, for a clopen saturated cover $\mathcal G_0=U_1\cup U_2$ we construct a short exact sequence of Moore complexes and derive a Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence for $H_\bullet(\mathcal G;A)$ for explicit computations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Large-Scale Dataset Distillation via Exploration-Exploitation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses the original data into compact synthetic datasets, reducing training time and storage while retaining model performance, enabling deployment under limited resources. Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration--Exploitation Distillation (E$^2$D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E$^2$D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being $18\times$ faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining $4.3\times$ faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

      <title>Building Safe and Deployable Clinical Natural Language Processing under Temporal Leakage Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical natural language processing (NLP) models have shown promise for supporting hospital discharge planning by leveraging narrative clinical documentation. However, note-based models are particularly vulnerable to temporal and lexical leakage, where documentation artifacts encode future clinical decisions and inflate apparent predictive performance. Such behavior poses substantial risks for real-world deployment, where overconfident or temporally invalid predictions can disrupt clinical workflows and compromise patient safety. This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training. Using next-day discharge prediction after elective spine surgery as a case study, we evaluate how auditing affects predictive behavior, calibration, and safety-relevant trade-offs. Results show that audited models exhibit more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced reliance on discharge-related lexical cues. These findings emphasize that deployment-ready clinical NLP systems should prioritize temporal validity, calibration, and behavioral robustness over optimistic performance.</description>

      <title>Conjugate Learning Theory: Uncovering the Mechanisms of Trainability and Generalization in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a notion of practical learnability grounded in finite sample settings, and develop a conjugate learning theoretical framework based on convex conjugate duality to characterize this learnability property. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that training deep neural networks (DNNs) with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves global optima of empirical risk by jointly controlling the extreme eigenvalues of a structure matrix and the gradient energy, and we establish a corresponding convergence theorem. We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability. On the generalization front, we derive deterministic and probabilistic bounds on generalization error based on generalized conditional entropy measures. The former explicitly delineates the range of generalization error, while the latter characterizes the distribution of generalization error relative to the deterministic bounds under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling conditions. Furthermore, these bounds explicitly quantify the influence of three key factors: (i) information loss induced by irreversibility in the model, (ii) the maximum attainable loss value, and (iii) the generalized conditional entropy of features with respect to labels. Moreover, they offer a unified theoretical lens for understanding the roles of regularization, irreversible transformations, and network depth in shaping the generalization behavior of deep neural networks. Extensive experiments validate all theoretical predictions, confirming the framework's correctness and consistency.</description>

      <title>EnterpriseBench Corecraft: Training Generalizable Agents on High-Fidelity RL Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution. We introduce CoreCraft, the first environment in EnterpriseBench, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. CoreCraft is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM 4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37% to 36.76% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4% on Tau2-Bench Retail, and +6.8% on Tool Decathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.</description>

Abstract: This note gives a self-contained overview of some important properties of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, compared with the standard linear optimal transport (OT) framework. More specifically, I explore the following questions: are GW optimal transport plans sparse? Under what conditions are they supported on a permutation? Do they satisfy a form of cyclical monotonicity? In particular, I present the conditionally negative semi-definite property and show that, when it holds, there are GW optimal plans that are sparse and supported on a permutation.</description>

      <title>Helpful to a Fault: Measuring Illicit Assistance in Multi-Turn, Multilingual LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based agents execute real-world workflows via tools and memory. These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings. Overall, STING provides a practical way to evaluate and stress-test agent misuse in realistic deployment settings, where interactions are inherently multi-turn and often multilingual.</description>

Abstract: The pursuit of general-purpose robotic manipulation is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, real-world interaction data. Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation.
