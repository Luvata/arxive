      <title>MIMIC-RD: Can LLMs differentially diagnose rare diseases in real-world clinical settings?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rare diseases affecting 1 in 10 Americans, their differential diagnosis remains challenging. Due to their impressive recall abilities, large language models (LLMs) have been recently explored for differential diagnosis. Existing approaches to evaluating LLM-based rare disease diagnosis suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on idealized clinical case studies that fail to capture real-world clinical complexity, or they use ICD codes as disease labels, which significantly undercounts rare diseases since many lack direct mappings to comprehensive rare disease databases like Orphanet. To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs. From our findings, we outline several future steps towards improving differential diagnosis of rare diseases.</description>

      <title>A Mind Cannot Be Smeared Across Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether machines can be conscious depends not only on what they compute, but \emph{when} they compute it. Most deployed artificial systems realise their functions via sequential or time-multiplexed updates. Conscious experience appears unified and simultaneous. I show that this difference matters formally. I augment Stack Theory with algebraic laws relating within time-window constraint satisfaction to conjunction. I introduce a precise temporal semantics over windowed trajectories $\tau^{\Delta,s}$ and prove that existential temporal realisation $\Diamond_{\Delta}$ does not preserve conjunction. A system can realise all the ingredients of experience across time without ever instantiating the experienced conjunction itself. I then distinguish two postulates. StrongSync requires objective co-instantiation of the grounded conjunction within the window, while WeakSync permits temporal ``smearing''. I formalise concurrency-capacity to measure what is needed to satisfy StrongSync. Finally, I review neurophysiological evidence suggesting that consciousness depends on phase synchrony and effective connectivity, and that loss of consciousness is often associated with its breakdown. This evidence makes WeakSync less plausible. Under StrongSync, software consciousness on strictly sequential substrates is impossible for contents whose grounding requires two or more simultaneous contributors. The more parts from which simultaneous contribution required, the more concurrency capacity is required. The hardware matters. Consciousness attribution therefore requires architectural inspection, not just functional performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems Analysis Reveals Functional Regimes in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models perform text generation through high-dimensional internal dynamics, yet the temporal organisation of these dynamics remains poorly understood. Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models. We stress that the proposed metric captures formal dynamical properties and does not imply subjective experience.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Stabilization Point: A Training-Time Signal for Stable Evidence and Shortcut Reliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained language models can improve task performance while subtly altering the evidence a model relies on. We propose a training-time interpretability view that tracks token-level attributions across finetuning epochs. We define explanation driftas the epoch-to-epoch change in normalized token attributions on a fixed probe set, and introduce the Reasoning Stabilization Point(RSP), the earliest epoch after which drift remains consistently low. RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally. In a controlled shortcut setting with label-correlated trigger tokens, attribution dynamics expose increasing reliance on the shortcut even when validation accuracy remains competitive. Overall, explanation drift provides a simple, low-cost diagnostic for monitoring how decision evidence evolves during fine-tuning and for selecting checkpoints in a stable-evidence regime.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Learning Design Knowledge from Data for Stylistic Design Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphic design often involves exploring different stylistic directions, which can be time-consuming for non-experts. We address this problem of stylistically improving designs based on natural language instructions. While VLMs have shown initial success in graphic design, their pretrained knowledge on styles is often too general and misaligned with specific domain data. For example, VLMs may associate minimalism with abstract designs, whereas designers emphasize shape and color choices. Our key insight is to leverage design data -- a collection of real-world designs that implicitly capture designer's principles -- to learn design knowledge and guide stylistic improvement. We propose PRISM (PRior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: (1) clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, (2) summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and (3) retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement. Experiments on the Crello dataset show that PRISM achieves the highest average rank of 1.49 (closer to 1 is better) over baselines in style alignment. User studies further validate these results, showing that PRISM is consistently preferred by designers.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Human-in-the-Loop Framework with Adaptive Intrusion Response for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must remain safe and effective when encountering rare long-tailed scenarios or cyber-physical intrusions during driving. We present RAIL, a risk-aware human-in-the-loop framework that turns heterogeneous runtime signals into calibrated control adaptations and focused learning. RAIL fuses three cues (curvature actuation integrity, time-to-collision proximity, and observation-shift consistency) into an Intrusion Risk Score (IRS) via a weighted Noisy-OR. When IRS exceeds a threshold, actions are blended with a cue-specific shield using a learned authority, while human override remains available; when risk is low, the nominal policy executes. A contextual bandit arbitrates among shields based on the cue vector, improving mitigation choices online. RAIL couples Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with risk-prioritized replay and dual rewards so that takeovers and near misses steer learning while nominal behavior remains covered. On MetaDrive, RAIL achieves a Test Return (TR) of 360.65, a Test Success Rate (TSR) of 0.85, a Test Safety Violation (TSV) of 0.75, and a Disturbance Rate (DR) of 0.0027, while logging only 29.07 training safety violations, outperforming RL, safe RL, offline/imitation learning, and prior HITL baselines. Under Controller Area Network (CAN) injection and LiDAR spoofing attacks, it improves Success Rate (SR) to 0.68 and 0.80, lowers the Disengagement Rate under Attack (DRA) to 0.37 and 0.03, and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to 0.34 and 0.11. In CARLA, RAIL attains a TR of 1609.70 and TSR of 0.41 with only 8000 steps.</description>

      <title>A self-evolving multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance for innovative mathematical problem generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical problem generation (MPG) is a significant research direction in the field of intelligent education. In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new technological approaches to problem-generation tasks. Although existing LLMs can achieve high correctness rates, they generally lack innovation and exhibit poor discrimination. In this paper, we propose the task of innovative math problem generation (IMPG). To solve the IMPG task, this paper proposes a self-evolving, multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance. First, a multi-role collaborative mechanism comprising a sampler, generator, evaluator, state machine, and memory is constructed, ensuring the correctness of generated problems through iterative optimization informed by self-assessment and external feedback. Second, we introduce an improved difficulty model to quantify difficulty and provide fine-grained guidance. We adopt the data-driven association-guided path sampling (DAPS) algorithm to enhance the semantic rationality of sampled encodings. Third, we construct the HSM3K-CN dataset, which comprises high-quality high school math problems. A multi-stage training pipeline is adopted, incorporating continual pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), to enhance the generation and evaluation capabilities of the base model. Finally, system self-evolution is achieved by transferring evaluation capabilities from the expert model to the apprentice model via distillation. Experiments show that, compared to baseline models, our proposed method significantly improves the innovation of the generated problems while maintaining a high correctness rate.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent DRL-based Lane Change Decision Model for Cooperative Planning in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) possess the ability to communicate and coordinate with one another, enabling cooperative platooning that enhances both energy efficiency and traffic flow. However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently manages fluctuating traffic agent numbers, significantly outperforming the baseline rule-based models. Notably, it enhances cooperative platooning rates up to 26.2\%, showcasing its potential to optimize CAV cooperation and traffic dynamics during the early stage of deployment.</description>

      <title>POLARIS: Typed Planning and Governed Execution for Agentic AI in Back-Office Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprise back office workflows require agentic systems that are auditable, policy-aligned, and operationally predictable, capabilities that generic multi-agent setups often fail to deliver. We present POLARIS (Policy-Aware LLM Agentic Reasoning for Integrated Systems), a governed orchestration framework that treats automation as typed plan synthesis and validated execution over LLM agents. A planner proposes structurally diverse, type checked directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), a rubric guided reasoning module selects a single compliant plan, and execution is guarded by validator gated checks, a bounded repair loop, and compiled policy guardrails that block or route side effects before they occur. Applied to document centric finance tasks, POLARIS produces decision grade artifacts and full execution traces while reducing human intervention. Empirically, POLARIS achieves a micro F1 of 0.81 on the SROIE dataset and, on a controlled synthetic suite, achieves 0.95 to 1.00 precision for anomaly routing with preserved audit trails. These evaluations constitute an initial benchmark for governed Agentic AI. POLARIS provides a methodological and benchmark reference for policy-aligned Agentic AI.

      <title>AI Co-Scientist for Knowledge Synthesis in Medical Contexts: A Proof of Concept</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research waste in biomedical science is driven by redundant studies, incomplete reporting, and the limited scalability of traditional evidence synthesis workflows. We present an AI co-scientist for scalable and transparent knowledge synthesis based on explicit formalization of Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study design (PICOS). The platform integrates relational storage, vector-based semantic retrieval, and a Neo4j knowledge graph. Evaluation was conducted on dementia-sport and non-communicable disease corpora. Automated PICOS compliance and study design classification from titles and abstracts were performed using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory baseline and a transformer-based multi-task classifier fine-tuned from PubMedBERT. Full-text synthesis employed retrieval-augmented generation with hybrid vector and graph retrieval, while BERTopic was used to identify thematic structure, redundancy, and evidence gaps. The transformer model achieved 95.7% accuracy for study design classification with strong agreement against expert annotations, while the Bi-LSTM achieved 87% accuracy for PICOS compliance detection. Retrieval-augmented generation outperformed non-retrieval generation for queries requiring structured constraints, cross-study integration, and graph-based reasoning, whereas non-retrieval approaches remained competitive for high-level summaries. Topic modeling revealed substantial thematic redundancy and identified underexplored research areas. These results demonstrate that PICOS-aware and explainable natural language processing can improve the scalability, transparency, and efficiency of evidence synthesis. The proposed architecture is domain-agnostic and offers a practical framework for reducing research waste across biomedical disciplines.</description>

      <title>Imandra CodeLogician: Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning for Precise Analysis of Software Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on code understanding tasks, yet they fundamentally lack the ability to perform precise, exhaustive mathematical reasoning about program behavior. Existing benchmarks either focus on mathematical proof automation, largely disconnected from real-world software, or on engineering tasks that do not require semantic rigor.
  We present CodeLogician, a neurosymbolic agent for precise analysis of software logic, integrated with ImandraX, an industrial automated reasoning engine deployed in financial markets and safety-critical systems. Unlike prior approaches that use formal methods primarily to validate LLM outputs, CodeLogician uses LLMs to construct explicit formal models of software systems, enabling automated reasoning to answer rich semantic questions beyond binary verification outcomes.
  To rigorously evaluate mathematical reasoning about software logic, we introduce code-logic-bench, a benchmark targeting the middle ground between theorem proving and software engineering benchmarks. It measures reasoning correctness about program state spaces, control flow, coverage constraints, and edge cases, with ground truth defined via formal modeling and region decomposition.
  Comparing LLM-only reasoning against LLMs augmented with CodeLogician, formal augmentation yields substantial improvements, closing a 41-47 percentage point gap in reasoning accuracy. These results demonstrate that neurosymbolic integration is essential for scaling program analysis toward rigorous, autonomous software understanding.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Collaborative Inductive Thematic Analysis: AI Guided Analysis and Human Interpretive Authority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in qualitative research raises important questions about analytic practice and interpretive authority. This study examines how researchers interact with an Inductive Thematic Analysis GPT (ITA-GPT), a purpose-built AI tool designed to support inductive thematic analysis through structured, semi-automated prompts aligned with reflexive thematic analysis and verbatim coding principles. Guided by a Human-Artificial Intelligence Collaborative Inductive Thematic Analysis (HACITA) framework, the study focuses on analytic process rather than substantive findings. Three experienced qualitative researchers conducted ITA-GPT assisted analyses of interview transcripts from education research in the Ghanaian teacher education context. The tool supported familiarization, verbatim in vivo coding, gerund-based descriptive coding, and theme development, while enforcing trace to text integrity, coverage checks, and auditability. Data sources included interaction logs, AI-generated tables, researcher revisions, deletions, insertions, comments, and reflexive memos. Findings show that ITA-GPT functioned as a procedural scaffold that structured analytic workflow and enhanced transparency. However, interpretive authority remained with human researchers, who exercised judgment through recurrent analytic actions including modification, deletion, rejection, insertion, and commenting. The study demonstrates how inductive thematic analysis is enacted through responsible human AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>MyGram: Modality-aware Graph Transformer with Global Distribution for Multi-modal Entity Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment aims to identify equivalent entities between two multi-modal Knowledge graphs by integrating multi-modal data, such as images and text, to enrich the semantic representations of entities. However, existing methods may overlook the structural contextual information within each modality, making them vulnerable to interference from shallow features. To address these challenges, we propose MyGram, a modality-aware graph transformer with global distribution for multi-modal entity alignment. Specifically, we develop a modality diffusion learning module to capture deep structural contextual information within modalities and enable fine-grained multi-modal fusion. In addition, we introduce a Gram Loss that acts as a regularization constraint by minimizing the volume of a 4-dimensional parallelotope formed by multi-modal features, thereby achieving global distribution consistency across modalities. We conduct experiments on five public datasets. Results show that MyGram outperforms baseline models, achieving a maximum improvement of 4.8% in Hits@1 on FBDB15K, 9.9% on FBYG15K, and 4.3% on DBP15K.</description>

Abstract: Evaluating large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems remains a critical challenge, as these systems must exhibit reliable coordination, transparent decision-making, and verifiable performance across evolving tasks. Existing evaluation approaches often limit themselves to single-response scoring or narrow benchmarks, which lack stability, extensibility, and automation when deployed in enterprise settings at multi-agent scale. We present AEMA (Adaptive Evaluation Multi-Agent), a process-aware and auditable framework that plans, executes, and aggregates multi-step evaluations across heterogeneous agentic workflows under human oversight. Compared to a single LLM-as-a-Judge, AEMA achieves greater stability, human alignment, and traceable records that support accountable automation. Our results on enterprise-style agent workflows simulated using realistic business scenarios demonstrate that AEMA provides a transparent and reproducible pathway toward responsible evaluation of LLM-based multi-agent systems.

      <title>LIBRA: Language Model Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm for Personalized Treatment Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates algorithmic recourse, contextual bandits, and large language models (LLMs) to support sequential decision-making in high-stakes settings such as personalized medicine. We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making.</description>

      <title>Thinking Traps in Long Chain-of-Thought: A Measurable Study and Trap-Aware Adaptive Restart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling test-time compute via Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, yet extended generation does not guarantee correctness: after an early wrong commitment, models may keep elaborating a self-consistent but incorrect prefix. Through fine-grained trajectory analysis, we identify Thinking Traps, prefix-dominant deadlocks where later reflection, alternative attempts, or verification fails to revise the root error. On a curated subset of DAPO-MATH, 89\% of failures exhibit such traps. To solve this problem, we introduce TAAR (Trap-Aware Adaptive Restart), a test-time control framework that trains a diagnostic policy to predict two signals from partial trajectories: a trap index for where to truncate and an escape probability for whether and how strongly to intervene. At inference time, TAAR truncates the trajectory before the predicted trap segment and adaptively restarts decoding; for severely trapped cases, it applies stronger perturbations, including higher-temperature resampling and an optional structured reboot suffix. Experiments on challenging mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-Diamond, HMMT25, BRUMO25) show that TAAR improves reasoning performance without fine-tuning base model parameters.</description>

      <title>Learn Like Humans: Use Meta-cognitive Reflection for Efficient Self-Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) enable complex autonomous behavior, current agents remain constrained by static, human-designed prompts that limit adaptability. Existing self-improving frameworks attempt to bridge this gap but typically rely on inefficient, multi-turn recursive loops that incur high computational costs. To address this, we propose Metacognitive Agent Reflective Self-improvement (MARS), a framework that achieves efficient self-evolution within a single recurrence cycle. Inspired by educational psychology, MARS mimics human learning by integrating principle-based reflection (abstracting normative rules to avoid errors) and procedural reflection (deriving step-by-step strategies for success). By synthesizing these insights into optimized instructions, MARS allows agents to systematically refine their reasoning logic without continuous online feedback. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MARS outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving systems while significantly reducing computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Process In-Context Learning: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning via Dynamic Demonstration Insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has proven highly effective across diverse large language model (LLM) tasks. However, its potential for enhancing tasks that demand step-by-step logical deduction, such as mathematical reasoning, remains underexplored. A core limitation of existing ICL approaches is their static use of demonstrations: examples are pre-selected before inference and remain fixed, failing to adapt to the dynamic confusion points that often arise during multi-step reasoning such as ambiguous calculations or logical gaps. These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps. Experiments show that PICL outperforms baseline methods by mitigating mid-inference confusion, highlighting the value of adaptive demonstration insertion in complex mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Learning of Safety Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid integration of AI algorithms in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and healthcare is raising significant concerns about the ability to meet stringent safety standards. Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs Ready for TOON? Benchmarking Structural Correctness-Sustainability Trade-offs in Novel Structured Output Formats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly required to generate structured, machine-readable outputs for downstream systems. While recent benchmarks have focused on evaluating the structural correctness of such outputs, the environmental impact of inference for different output formats has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we argue that structured output formats should be assessed not only in terms of correctness, but also with respect to their environmental efficiency. To this end, we introduce a sustainability-aware evaluation framework for structured generation that measures token usage, generation time, and estimated carbon emissions. Within this framework, we propose the Environment-Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCS_env), a unified metric that integrates structural correctness with carbon-aware efficiency. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark the novel TOON format against established representations (JSON, XML, YAML) across multiple LLMs spanning different architectures and parameter scales.
  Our results reveal a consistent trade-off: TOON yields markedly more compact outputs and lower emissions, but lower structural correctness when models lack native support. We show that increased model capacity reduces this gap and that environment-aware scoring can shift format rankings depending on deployment priorities. highlighting the need for sustainability-inclusive benchmarking and provides empirical evidence that compact representations such as TOON can offer practical advantages in large-scale, carbon-conscious LLM deployments.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent System for Generating Actionable Business Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customer reviews contain rich signals about product weaknesses and unmet user needs, yet existing analytic methods rarely move beyond descriptive tasks such as sentiment analysis or aspect extraction. While large language models (LLMs) can generate free-form suggestions, their outputs often lack accuracy and depth of reasoning. In this paper, we present a multi-agent, LLM-based framework for prescriptive decision support, which transforms large scale review corpora into actionable business advice. The framework integrates four components: clustering to select representative reviews, generation of advices, iterative evaluation, and feasibility based ranking. This design couples corpus distillation with feedback driven advice refinement to produce outputs that are specific, actionable, and practical. Experiments across three service domains and multiple model families show that our framework consistently outperform single model baselines on actionability, specificity, and non-redundancy, with medium sized models approaching the performance of large model frameworks.</description>

      <title>ARC: Active and Reflection-driven Context Management for Long-Horizon Information Seeking Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed as research agents for deep search and long-horizon information seeking, yet their performance often degrades as interaction histories grow. This degradation, known as context rot, reflects a failure to maintain coherent and task-relevant internal states over extended reasoning horizons. Existing approaches primarily manage context through raw accumulation or passive summarization, treating it as a static artifact and allowing early errors or misplaced emphasis to persist. Motivated by this perspective, we propose ARC, which is the first framework to systematically formulate context management as an active, reflection-driven process that treats context as a dynamic internal reasoning state during execution. ARC operationalizes this view through reflection-driven monitoring and revision, allowing agents to actively reorganize their working context when misalignment or degradation is detected. Experiments on challenging long-horizon information-seeking benchmarks show that ARC consistently outperforms passive context compression methods, achieving up to an 11% absolute improvement in accuracy on BrowseComp-ZH with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct.</description>

      <title>Abstract Argumentation with Subargument Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dung's abstract argumentation framework characterises argument acceptability solely via an attack relation, deliberately abstracting from the internal structure of arguments. While this level of abstraction has enabled a rich body of results, it limits the ability to represent structural dependencies that are central in many structured argumentation formalisms, in particular subargument relations. Existing extensions, including bipolar argumentation frameworks, introduce support relations, but these do not capture the asymmetric and constitutive nature of subarguments or their interaction with attacks. In this paper, we study abstract argumentation frameworks enriched with an explicit subargument relation, treated alongside attack as a basic relation. We analyse how subargument relations interact with attacks and examine their impact on fundamental semantic properties. This framework provides a principled abstraction of structural information and clarifies the role of subarguments in abstract acceptability reasoning.</description>

      <title>Partial Reasoning in Language Models: Search and Refinement Guided by Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning and planning tasks has drawn increasing attention in Artificial Intelligence research. Despite their remarkable progress, these models still exhibit limitations in multi-step inference scenarios, particularly in mathematical and logical reasoning. We introduce PREGU (Partial Reasoning Guided by Uncertainty). PREGU monitors the entropy of the output distribution during autoregressive generation and halts the process whenever entropy exceeds a defined threshold, signaling uncertainty. From that point, a localized search is performed in the latent space to refine the partial reasoning and select the most coherent answer, using the Soft Reasoning method. Experiments conducted with LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2-7B across four reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, GSM-Hard, SVAMP, and StrategyQA) showed performance greater than or similar to Soft Reasoning, indicating that entropy can serve as an effective signal to trigger selective refinement during reasoning.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing 3D human motion generation and understanding methods often exhibit limited interpretability, restricting effective mutual enhancement between these inherently related tasks. While current unified frameworks based on large language models (LLMs) leverage linguistic priors, they frequently encounter challenges in semantic alignment and task coherence. Moreover, the next-token prediction paradigm in LLMs is ill-suited for motion sequences, causing cumulative prediction errors. To address these limitations, we propose UniMo, a novel framework that integrates motion-language information and interpretable chain of thought (CoT) reasoning into the LLM via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We further introduce reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a post-training strategy that optimizes over groups of tokens to enforce structural correctness and semantic alignment, mitigating cumulative errors in motion token prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMo significantly outperforms existing unified and task-specific models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both motion generation and understanding.</description>

      <title>DriveSafe: A Hierarchical Risk Taxonomy for Safety-Critical LLM-Based Driving Assistants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into vehicle-based digital assistants, where unsafe, ambiguous, or legally incorrect responses can lead to serious safety, ethical, and regulatory consequences. Despite growing interest in LLM safety, existing taxonomies and evaluation frameworks remain largely general-purpose and fail to capture the domain-specific risks inherent to real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce DriveSafe, a hierarchical, four-level risk taxonomy designed to systematically characterize safety-critical failure modes of LLM-based driving assistants. The taxonomy comprises 129 fine-grained atomic risk categories spanning technical, legal, societal, and ethical dimensions, grounded in real-world driving regulations and safety principles and reviewed by domain experts. To validate the safety relevance and realism of the constructed prompts, we evaluate their refusal behavior across six widely deployed LLMs. Our analysis shows that the evaluated models often fail to appropriately refuse unsafe or non-compliant driving-related queries, underscoring the limitations of general-purpose safety alignment in driving contexts.</description>

      <title>TIDE: A Trace-Informed Depth-First Exploration for Planning with Temporally Extended Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task planning with temporally extended goals (TEGs) is a critical challenge in AI and robotics, enabling agents to achieve complex sequences of objectives over time rather than addressing isolated, immediate tasks. Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Allocation and Sub-Optimal Channel Assignment for Downlink NOMA Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) system has emerged as a promising candidate for multiple access frameworks due to the evolution of deep machine learning, trying to incorporate deep machine learning into the NOMA system. The main motivation for such active studies is the growing need to optimize the utilization of network resources as the expansion of the internet of things (IoT) caused a scarcity of network resources. The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL). Despite this, the channel assignment problem remains unclear and requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework incorporating replay memory with an on-policy algorithm, allocating network resources in a NOMA system to generalize the learning. Also, we provide extensive simulations to evaluate the effects of varying the learning rate, batch size, type of model, and the number of features in the state.</description>

      <title>Improving Large Molecular Language Model via Relation-aware Multimodal Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their instruction-following capabilities and achieved powerful performance on various tasks. Inspired by their success, recent works in the molecular domain have led to the development of large molecular language models (LMLMs) that integrate 1D molecular strings or 2D molecular graphs into the language models. However, existing LMLMs often suffer from hallucination and limited robustness, largely due to inadequate integration of diverse molecular modalities such as 1D sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformations. To address these limitations, we propose CoLLaMo, a large language model-based molecular assistant equipped with a multi-level molecular modality-collaborative projector. The relation-aware modality-collaborative attention mechanism in the projector facilitates fine-grained and relation-guided information exchange between atoms by incorporating 2D structural and 3D spatial relations. Furthermore, we present a molecule-centric new automatic measurement, including a hallucination assessment metric and GPT-based caption quality evaluation to address the limitations of token-based generic evaluation metrics (i.e., BLEU) widely used in assessing molecular comprehension of LMLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoLLaMo enhances the molecular modality generalization capabilities of LMLMs, achieving the best performance on multiple tasks, including molecule captioning, computed property QA, descriptive property QA, motif counting, and IUPAC name prediction.</description>

      <title>FutureX-Pro: Extending Future Prediction to High-Value Vertical Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon FutureX, which established a live benchmark for general-purpose future prediction, this report introduces FutureX-Pro, including FutureX-Finance, FutureX-Retail, FutureX-PublicHealth, FutureX-NaturalDisaster, and FutureX-Search. These together form a specialized framework extending agentic future prediction to high-value vertical domains. While generalist agents demonstrate proficiency in open-domain search, their reliability in capital-intensive and safety-critical sectors remains under-explored. FutureX-Pro targets four economically and socially pivotal verticals: Finance, Retail, Public Health, and Natural Disaster. We benchmark agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on entry-level yet foundational prediction tasks -- ranging from forecasting market indicators and supply chain demands to tracking epidemic trends and natural disasters. By adapting the contamination-free, live-evaluation pipeline of FutureX, we assess whether current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) agentic LLMs possess the domain grounding necessary for industrial deployment. Our findings reveal the performance gap between generalist reasoning and the precision required for high-value vertical applications.</description>

      <title>Docs2Synth: A Synthetic Data Trained Retriever Framework for Scanned Visually Rich Documents Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document understanding (VRDU) in regulated domains is particularly challenging, since scanned documents often contain sensitive, evolving, and domain specific knowledge. This leads to two major challenges: the lack of manual annotations for model adaptation and the difficulty for pretrained models to stay up-to-date with domain-specific facts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong zero-shot abilities, they still suffer from hallucination and limited domain grounding. In contrast, discriminative Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) provide reliable grounding but require costly annotations to cover new domains. We introduce Docs2Synth, a synthetic-supervision framework that enables retrieval-guided inference for private and low-resource domains. Docs2Synth automatically processes raw document collections, generates and verifies diverse QA pairs via an agent-based system, and trains a lightweight visual retriever to extract domain-relevant evidence. During inference, the retriever collaborates with an MLLM through an iterative retrieval--generation loop, reducing hallucination and improving response consistency. We further deliver Docs2Synth as an easy-to-use Python package, enabling plug-and-play deployment across diverse real-world scenarios. Experiments on multiple VRDU benchmarks show that Docs2Synth substantially enhances grounding and domain generalization without requiring human annotations.</description>

      <title>ToolPRMBench: Evaluating and Advancing Process Reward Models for Tool-using Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward-guided search methods have demonstrated strong potential in enhancing tool-using agents by effectively guiding sampling and exploration over complex action spaces. As a core design, those search methods utilize process reward models (PRMs) to provide step-level rewards, enabling more fine-grained monitoring. However, there is a lack of systematic and reliable evaluation benchmarks for PRMs in tool-using settings. In this paper, we introduce ToolPRMBench, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate PRMs for tool-using agents. ToolPRMBench is built on top of several representative tool-using benchmarks and converts agent trajectories into step-level test cases. Each case contains the interaction history, a correct action, a plausible but incorrect alternative, and relevant tool metadata. We respectively utilize offline sampling to isolate local single-step errors and online sampling to capture realistic multi-step failures from full agent rollouts. A multi-LLM verification pipeline is proposed to reduce label noise and ensure data quality. We conduct extensive experiments across large language models, general PRMs, and tool-specialized PRMs on ToolPRMBench. The results reveal clear differences in PRM effectiveness and highlight the potential of specialized PRMs for tool-using. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/David-Li0406/ToolPRMBench.</description>

      <title>Survival is the Only Reward: Sustainable Self-Training Through Environment-Mediated Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-training systems often degenerate due to the lack of an external criterion for judging data quality, leading to reward hacking and semantic drift. This paper provides a proof-of-concept system architecture for stable self-training under sparse external feedback and bounded memory, and empirically characterises its learning dynamics and failure modes.
  We introduce a self-training architecture in which learning is mediated exclusively by environmental viability, rather than by reward, objective functions, or externally defined fitness criteria. Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.
  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction. This work establishes that environment-grounded selection enables sustainable open-ended self-improvement, offering a viable path toward more robust and generalisable autonomous systems without reliance on human-curated data or complex reward shaping.</description>

      <title>Beyond Human Annotation: Recent Advances in Data Generation Methods for Document Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Document Intelligence (DI) demands large-scale, high-quality training data, yet manual annotation remains a critical bottleneck. While data generation methods are evolving rapidly, existing surveys are constrained by fragmented focuses on single modalities or specific tasks, lacking a unified perspective aligned with real-world workflows. To fill this gap, this survey establishes the first comprehensive technical map for data generation in DI. Data generation is redefined as supervisory signal production, and a novel taxonomy is introduced based on the "availability of data and labels." This framework organizes methodologies into four resource-centric paradigms: Data Augmentation, Data Generation from Scratch, Automated Data Annotation, and Self-Supervised Signal Construction. Furthermore, a multi-level evaluation framework is established to integrate intrinsic quality and extrinsic utility, compiling performance gains across diverse DI benchmarks. Guided by this unified structure, the methodological landscape is dissected to reveal critical challenges such as fidelity gaps and frontiers including co-evolutionary ecosystems. Ultimately, by systematizing this fragmented field, data generation is positioned as the central engine for next-generation DI.</description>

      <title>MARO: Learning Stronger Reasoning from Social Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans face countless scenarios that require reasoning and judgment in daily life. However, existing large language model training methods primarily allow models to learn from existing textual content or solve predetermined problems, lacking experience in real scenarios involving interaction, negotiation, and competition with others. To address this, this paper proposes Multi-Agent Reward Optimization (MARO), a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire stronger reasoning abilities by learning and practicing in multi-agent social environments. Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following. This reveals the tremendous potential of multi-agent social learning in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Actionable Advice from Reviews via Mixture of LoRA Experts: A Two-LLM Pipeline for Issue Extraction and Business Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customer reviews contain detailed, domain specific signals about service failures and user expectations, but converting this unstructured feedback into actionable business decisions remains difficult. We study review-to-action generation: producing concrete, implementable recommendations grounded in review text. We propose a modular two-LLM framework in which an Issue model extracts salient issues and assigns coarse themes, and an Advice model generates targeted operational fixes conditioned on the extracted issue representation. To enable specialization without expensive full fine-tuning, we adapt the Advice model using a mixture of LoRA experts strategy: multiple low-rank adapters are trained and a lightweight gating mechanism performs token-level expert mixing at inference, combining complementary expertise across issue types. We construct synthetic review-issue-advice triples from Yelp reviews (airlines and restaurants) to supervise training, and evaluate recommendations using an eight dimension operational rubric spanning actionability, specificity, feasibility, expected impact, novelty, non-redundancy, bias, and clarity. Across both domains, our approach consistently outperforms prompting-only and single-adapter baselines, yielding higher actionability and specificity while retaining favorable efficiency-quality trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Psych\=eChat: An Empathic Framework Focused on Emotion Shift Tracking and Safety Risk Analysis in Psychological Counseling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable advancements in psychological counseling. However, existing models generally do not explicitly model seekers' emotion shifts across counseling sessions, a core focus in classical psychological schools. Moreover, how to align counselor models' responses with these emotion shifts while proactively mitigating safety risks remains underexplored. To bridge these gaps, we propose Psych\=eChat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling. Specifically, we employ interactive role-playing to synthesize counselor--seeker dialogues, incorporating two modules: Emotion Management Module, to capture seekers' current emotions and emotion shifts; and Risk Control Module, to anticipate seekers' subsequent reactions and identify potential risks. Furthermore, we introduce two modeling paradigms. The Agent Mode structures emotion management, risk control, and counselor responses into a collaborative multi-agent pipeline. The LLM Mode integrates these stages into a unified chain-of-thought for end-to-end inference, balancing efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments, including interactive scoring, dialogue-level evaluation, and human assessment, demonstrate that Psych\=eChat outperforms existing methods for emotional insight and safety control.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs Smarter Than Chimpanzees? An Evaluation on Perspective Taking and Knowledge State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive anthropology suggests that the distinction of human intelligence lies in the ability to infer other individuals' knowledge states and understand their intentions. In comparison, our closest animal relative, chimpanzees, lack the capacity to do so. With this paper, we aim to evaluate LLM performance in the area of knowledge state tracking and estimation. We design two tasks to test (1) if LLMs can detect when story characters, through their actions, demonstrate knowledge they should not possess, and (2) if LLMs can predict story characters' next actions based on their own knowledge vs. objective truths they do not know. Results reveal that most current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve near-random performance on both tasks, and are substantially inferior to humans. We argue future LLM research should place more weight on the abilities of knowledge estimation and intention understanding.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model for OWL Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks such as deduction has been widely investigated in recent years. Yet, their capacity to generate proofs-faithful, human-readable explanations of why conclusions follow-remains largely under explored. In this work, we study proof generation in the context of OWL ontologies, which are widely adopted for representing and reasoning over complex knowledge, by developing an automated dataset construction and evaluation framework. Our evaluation encompassing three sequential tasks for complete proving: Extraction, Simplification, and Explanation, as well as an additional task of assessing Logic Completeness of the premise. Through extensive experiments on widely used reasoning LLMs, we achieve important findings including: (1) Some models achieve overall strong results but remain limited on complex cases; (2) Logical complexity, rather than representation format (formal logic language versus natural language), is the dominant factor shaping LLM performance; and (3) Noise and incompleteness in input data substantially diminish LLMs' performance. Together, these results underscore both the promise of LLMs for explanation with rigorous logics and the gap of supporting resilient reasoning under complex or imperfect conditions.

      <title>Failure Modes in Multi-Hop QA: The Weakest Link Law and the Recognition Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite scaling to massive context windows, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with multi-hop reasoning due to inherent position bias, which causes them to overlook information at certain positions. Whether these failures stem from an inability to locate evidence (recognition failure) or integrate it (synthesis failure) is unclear. We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the "Weakest Link Law": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $&lt;3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that "thinking" models that utilize System-2 reasoning, effectively locate and integrate the required information, matching gold-only baselines even in noisy, long-context settings.</description>

      <title>Agentic Reasoning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process underlying inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>MemeLens: Multilingual Multitask VLMs for Memes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memes are a dominant medium for online communication and manipulation because meaning emerges from interactions between embedded text, imagery, and cultural context. Existing meme research is distributed across tasks (hate, misogyny, propaganda, sentiment, humour) and languages, which limits cross-domain generalization. To address this gap we propose MemeLens, a unified multilingual and multitask explanation-enhanced Vision Language Model (VLM) for meme understanding. We consolidate 38 public meme datasets, filter and map dataset-specific labels into a shared taxonomy of $20$ tasks spanning harm, targets, figurative/pragmatic intent, and affect. We present a comprehensive empirical analysis across modeling paradigms, task categories, and datasets. Our findings suggest that robust meme understanding requires multimodal training, exhibits substantial variation across semantic categories, and remains sensitive to over-specialization when models are fine-tuned on individual datasets rather than trained in a unified setting. We will make the experimental resources and datasets publicly available for the community.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the AI Scientist: Interactive Multi-Agent Workflows for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems for scientific discovery have demonstrated remarkable potential, yet existing approaches remain largely proprietary and operate in batch-processing modes requiring hours per research cycle, precluding real-time researcher guidance. This paper introduces Deep Research, a multi-agent system enabling interactive scientific investigation with turnaround times measured in minutes. The architecture comprises specialized agents for planning, data analysis, literature search, and novelty detection, unified through a persistent world state that maintains context across iterative research cycles. Two operational modes support different workflows: semi-autonomous mode with selective human checkpoints, and fully autonomous mode for extended investigations. Evaluation on the BixBench computational biology benchmark demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving 48.8% accuracy on open response and 64.5% on multiple-choice evaluation, exceeding existing baselines by 14 to 26 percentage points. Analysis of architectural constraints, including open access literature limitations and challenges inherent to automated novelty assessment, informs practical deployment considerations for AI-assisted scientific workflows.</description>

      <title>How Clinicians Think and What AI Can Learn From It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most clinical AI systems operate as prediction engines -- producing labels or risk scores -- yet real clinical reasoning is a time-bounded, sequential control problem under uncertainty. Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\to$ perception $\to$ inference $\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($\epsilon$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact.</description>

      <title>Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI): Architectures, Taxonomies, and Evaluation of Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is moving from models that only generate text to Agentic AI, where systems behave as autonomous entities that can perceive, reason, plan, and act. Large Language Models (LLMs) are no longer used only as passive knowledge engines but as cognitive controllers that combine memory, tool use, and feedback from their environment to pursue extended goals. This shift already supports the automation of complex workflows in software engineering, scientific discovery, and web navigation, yet the variety of emerging designs, from simple single loop agents to hierarchical multi agent systems, makes the landscape hard to navigate. In this paper, we investigate architectures and propose a unified taxonomy that breaks agents into Perception, Brain, Planning, Action, Tool Use, and Collaboration. We use this lens to describe the move from linear reasoning procedures to native inference time reasoning models, and the transition from fixed API calls to open standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Native Computer Use. We also group the environments in which these agents operate, including digital operating systems, embodied robotics, and other specialized domains, and we review current evaluation practices. Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as hallucination in action, infinite loops, and prompt injection, and outline future research directions toward more robust and reliable autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>STEP-LLM: Generating CAD STEP Models from Natural Language with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is vital to modern manufacturing, yet model creation remains labor-intensive and expertise-heavy. To enable non-experts to translate intuitive design intent into manufacturable artifacts, recent large language models-based text-to-CAD efforts focus on command sequences or script-based formats like CadQuery. However, these formats are kernel-dependent and lack universality for manufacturing. In contrast, the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP, ISO 10303) file is a widely adopted, neutral boundary representation (B-rep) format directly compatible with manufacturing, but its graph-structured, cross-referenced nature poses unique challenges for auto-regressive LLMs. To address this, we curate a dataset of ~40K STEP-caption pairs and introduce novel preprocessing tailored for the graph-structured format of STEP, including a depth-first search-based reserialization that linearizes cross-references while preserving locality and chain-of-thought(CoT)-style structural annotations that guide global coherence. We integrate retrieval-augmented generation to ground predictions in relevant examples for supervised fine-tuning, and refine generation quality through reinforcement learning with a specific Chamfer Distance-based geometric reward. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our STEP-LLM in geometric fidelity over the Text2CAD baseline, with improvements arising from multiple stages of our framework: the RAG module substantially enhances completeness and renderability, the DFS-based reserialization strengthens overall accuracy, and the RL further reduces geometric discrepancy. Both metrics and visual comparisons confirm that STEP-LLM generates shapes with higher fidelity than Text2CAD. These results show the feasibility of LLM-driven STEP model generation from natural language, showing its potential to democratize CAD design for manufacturing.</description>

      <title>MedConsultBench: A Full-Cycle, Fine-Grained, Process-Aware Benchmark for Medical Consultation Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluations of medical consultation agents often prioritize outcome-oriented tasks, frequently overlooking the end-to-end process integrity and clinical safety essential for real-world practice. While recent interactive benchmarks have introduced dynamic scenarios, they often remain fragmented and coarse-grained, failing to capture the structured inquiry logic and diagnostic rigor required in professional consultations. To bridge this gap, we propose MedConsultBench, a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate the complete online consultation cycle by covering the entire clinical workflow from history taking and diagnosis to treatment planning and follow-up Q\&amp;A. Our methodology introduces Atomic Information Units (AIUs) to track clinical information acquisition at a sub-turn level, enabling precise monitoring of how key facts are elicited through 22 fine-grained metrics. By addressing the underspecification and ambiguity inherent in online consultations, the benchmark evaluates uncertainty-aware yet concise inquiry while emphasizing medication regimen compatibility and the ability to handle realistic post-prescription follow-up Q\&amp;A via constraint-respecting plan revisions. Systematic evaluation of 19 large language models reveals that high diagnostic accuracy often masks significant deficiencies in information-gathering efficiency and medication safety. These results underscore a critical gap between theoretical medical knowledge and clinical practice ability, establishing MedConsultBench as a rigorous foundation for aligning medical AI with the nuanced requirements of real-world clinical care.</description>

      <title>Empowering All-in-Loop Health Management of Spacecraft Power System in the Mega-Constellation Era via Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is foreseeable that the number of spacecraft will increase exponentially, ushering in an era dominated by satellite mega-constellations (SMC). This necessitates a focus on energy in space: spacecraft power systems (SPS), especially their health management (HM), given their role in power supply and high failure rates. Providing health management for dozens of SPS and for thousands of SPS represents two fundamentally different paradigms. Therefore, to adapt the health management in the SMC era, this work proposes a principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC principle) and develops SpaceHMchat, an open-source Human-AI collaboration (HAIC) framework for all-in-loop health management (AIL HM). SpaceHMchat serves across the entire loop of work condition recognition, anomaly detection, fault localization, and maintenance decision making, achieving goals such as conversational task completion, adaptive human-in-the-loop learning, personnel structure optimization, knowledge sharing, efficiency enhancement, as well as transparent reasoning and improved interpretability. Meanwhile, to validate this exploration, a hardware-realistic fault injection experimental platform is established, and its simulation model is built and open-sourced, both fully replicating the real SPS. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that SpaceHMchat achieves excellent performance across 23 quantitative metrics, such as 100% conclusion accuracy in logical reasoning of work condition recognition, over 99% success rate in anomaly detection tool invocation, over 90% precision in fault localization, and knowledge base search time under 3 minutes in maintenance decision-making. Another contribution of this work is the release of the first-ever AIL HM dataset of SPS. This dataset contains four sub-datasets, involving 4 types of AIL HM sub-tasks, 17 types of faults, and over 700,000 timestamps.</description>

      <title>Logic-Guided Multistage Inference for Explainable Multidefendant Judgment Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crime disrupts societal stability, making law essential for balance. In multidefendant cases, assigning responsibility is complex and challenges fairness, requiring precise role differentiation. However, judicial phrasing often obscures the roles of the defendants, hindering effective AI-driven analyses. To address this issue, we incorporate sentencing logic into a pretrained Transformer encoder framework to enhance the intelligent assistance in multidefendant cases while ensuring legal interpretability. Within this framework an oriented masking mechanism clarifies roles and a comparative data construction strategy improves the model's sensitivity to culpability distinctions between principals and accomplices. Predicted guilt labels are further incorporated into a regression model through broadcasting, consolidating crime descriptions and court views. Our proposed masked multistage inference (MMSI) framework, evaluated on the custom IMLJP dataset for intentional injury cases, achieves significant accuracy improvements, outperforming baselines in role-based culpability differentiation. This work offers a robust solution for enhancing intelligent judicial systems, with publicly code available.</description>

      <title>Neurosymbolic LoRA: Why and When to Tune Weights vs. Rewrite Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted either through numerical updates that alter model parameters or symbolic manipulations that work on discrete prompts or logical constraints. While numerical fine-tuning excels at injecting new factual knowledge, symbolic updates offer flexible control of style and alignment without retraining. We introduce a neurosymbolic LoRA framework that dynamically combines these two complementary strategies. Specifically, we present a unified monitoring signal and a reward-based classifier to decide when to employ LoRA for deeper factual reconstruction and when to apply TextGrad for token-level edits. Our approach remains memory-efficient by offloading the symbolic transformations to an external LLM only when needed. Additionally, the refined prompts produced during symbolic editing serve as high-quality, reusable training data, an important benefit in data-scarce domains like mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones show that neurosymbolic LoRA consistently outperforms purely numerical or purely symbolic baselines, demonstrating superior adaptability and improved performance. Our findings highlight the value of interleaving numerical and symbolic updates to unlock a new level of versatility in language model fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Teaching Large Reasoning Models Effective Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have recently shown impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks, often by engaging in self-reflective behaviors such as self-critique and backtracking. However, not all reflections are beneficial-many are superficial, offering little to no improvement over the original answer and incurring computation overhead. In this paper, we identify and address the problem of superficial reflection in LRMs. We first propose Self-Critique Fine-Tuning (SCFT), a training framework that enhances the model's reflective reasoning ability using only self-generated critiques. SCFT prompts models to critique their own outputs, filters high-quality critiques through rejection sampling, and fine-tunes the model using a critique-based objective. Building on this strong foundation, we further introduce Reinforcement Learning with Effective Reflection Rewards (RLERR). RLERR leverages the high-quality reflections initialized by SCFT to construct reward signals, guiding the model to internalize the self-correction process via reinforcement learning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, AIME2024 and AIME2025, show that SCFT and RLERR significantly improve both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. All data and codes are available at https://github.com/wanghanbinpanda/SCFT.</description>

      <title>Vision Language Models for Optimization-Driven Intent Processing in Autonomous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) allows operators to specify high-level network goals rather than low-level configurations. While recent work demonstrates that large language models can automate configuration tasks, a distinct class of intents requires generating optimization code to compute provably optimal solutions for traffic engineering, routing, and resource allocation. Current systems assume text-based intent expression, requiring operators to enumerate topologies and parameters in prose. Network practitioners naturally reason about structure through diagrams, yet whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process annotated network sketches into correct optimization code remains unexplored. We present IntentOpt, a benchmark of 85 optimization problems across 17 categories, evaluating four VLMs (GPT-5-Mini, Claude-Haiku-4.5, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision) under three prompting strategies on multimodal versus text-only inputs. Our evaluation shows that visual parameter extraction reduces execution success by 12-21 percentage points (pp), with GPT-5-Mini dropping from 93% to 72%. Program-of-thought prompting decreases performance by up to 13 pp, and open-source models lag behind closed-source ones, with Llama-3.2-11B-Vision reaching 18% compared to 75% for GPT-5-Mini. These results establish baseline capabilities and limitations of current VLMs for optimization code generation within an IBN system. We also demonstrate practical feasibility through a case study that deploys VLM-generated code to network testbed infrastructure using Model Context Protocol.</description>

      <title>VIRO: Robust and Efficient Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning with Verification for Referring Expression Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize the image region corresponding to a natural-language query. Recent neuro-symbolic REC approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to perform compositional reasoning, decomposing queries 4 structured programs and executing them step-by-step. While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps. Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 61.1% balanced accuracy across target-present and no-target settings, and demonstrates generalization to real-world egocentric data. Furthermore, VIRO shows superior computational efficiency in terms of throughput, high reliability with a program failure rate of less than 0.3%, and scalability through decoupled program generation from execution.</description>

      <title>SL-CBM: Enhancing Concept Bottleneck Models with Semantic Locality for Better Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is crucial for building transparent and trustworthy machine learning systems, especially in high-stakes domains. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models.</description>

      <title>MirrorGuard: Toward Secure Computer-Use Agents via Simulation-to-Real Reasoning Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large foundation models are integrated into Computer Use Agents (CUAs), enabling autonomous interaction with operating systems through graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to perform complex tasks. This autonomy introduces serious security risks: malicious instructions or visual prompt injections can trigger unsafe reasoning and cause harmful system-level actions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based blocking, prevent damage but often abort tasks prematurely, reducing agent utility. In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR. Our work proves that simulation-derived defenses can provide robust, real-world protection while maintaining the fundamental utility of the agent. Our code and model are publicly available at https://bmz-q-q.github.io/MirrorGuard/.</description>

Abstract: Automated agent workflows can enhance the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs), but common search strategies rely on stochastic exploration and often traverse implausible branches. This occurs because current pipelines sample candidate steps from generic prompts or learned policies with weak domain priors, yielding near-random walks over operators, units, and formats. To promote ordered exploration, this paper introduces SCULPT, a constraint-guided approach for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that integrates domain-aware scoring into selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths. Under matched LLM configurations, SCULPT yields stable improvements on multiple datasets; additional results with GPT-5.2 assess executor transferability and performance on frontier reasoning models. Overall, domain-aware constraints can improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency and reasoning stability.</description>

      <title>Mining Citywide Dengue Spread Patterns in Singapore Through Hotspot Dynamics from Open Web Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, continues to pose a persistent public health challenge in urban areas, particularly in tropical regions such as Singapore. Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience.</description>

      <title>Human Emotion Verification by Action Languages via Answer Set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the action language C-MT (Mind Transition Language). It is built on top of answer set programming (ASP) and transition systems to represent how human mental states evolve in response to sequences of observable actions. Drawing on well-established psychological theories, such as the Appraisal Theory of Emotion, we formalize mental states, such as emotions, as multi-dimensional configurations. With the objective to address the need for controlled agent behaviors and to restrict unwanted mental side-effects of actions, we extend the language with a novel causal rule, forbids to cause, along with expressions specialized for mental state dynamics, which enables the modeling of principles for valid transitions between mental states. These principles of mental change are translated into transition constraints, and properties of invariance, which are rigorously evaluated using transition systems in terms of so-called trajectories. This enables controlled reasoning about the dynamic evolution of human mental states. Furthermore, the framework supports the comparison of different dynamics of change by analyzing trajectories that adhere to different psychological principles. We apply the action language to design models for emotion verification. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).</description>

      <title>Actionable Interpretability Must Be Defined in Terms of Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper argues that interpretability research in Artificial Intelligence is fundamentally ill-posed as existing definitions of interpretability are not *actionable*: they fail to provide formal principles from which concrete modelling and inferential rules can be derived. We posit that for a definition of interpretability to be actionable, it must be given in terms of *symmetries*. We hypothesise that four symmetries suffice to (i) motivate core interpretability properties, (ii) characterize the class of interpretable models, and (iii) derive a unified formulation of interpretable inference (e.g., alignment, interventions, and counterfactuals) as a form of Bayesian inversion.</description>

      <title>MagicGUI-RMS: A Multi-Agent Reward Model System for Self-Evolving GUI Agents via Automated Feedback Reflux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents are rapidly progressing toward autonomous interaction and reliable task execution across diverse applications. However, two central challenges remain unresolved: automating the evaluation of agent trajectories and generating high-quality training data at scale to enable continual improvement. Existing approaches often depend on manual annotation or static rule-based verification, which restricts scalability and limits adaptability in dynamic environments. We present MagicGUI-RMS, a multi-agent reward model system that delivers adaptive trajectory evaluation, corrective feedback, and self-evolving learning capabilities. MagicGUI-RMS integrates a Domain-Specific Reward Model (DS-RM) with a General-Purpose Reward Model (GP-RM), enabling fine-grained action assessment and robust generalization across heterogeneous GUI tasks. To support reward learning at scale, we design a structured data construction pipeline that automatically produces balanced and diverse reward datasets, effectively reducing annotation costs while maintaining sample fidelity. During execution, the reward model system identifies erroneous actions, proposes refined alternatives, and continuously enhances agent behavior through an automated data-reflux mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicGUI-RMS yields substantial gains in task accuracy, behavioral robustness. These results establish MagicGUI-RMS as a principled and effective foundation for building self-improving GUI agents driven by reward-based adaptation.</description>

      <title>Responsible AI for General-Purpose Systems: Overview, Challenges, and A Path Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern general-purpose AI systems made using large language and vision models, are capable of performing a range of tasks like writing text articles, generating and debugging codes, querying databases, and translating from one language to another, which has made them quite popular across industries. However, there are risks like hallucinations, toxicity, and stereotypes in their output that make them untrustworthy. We review various risks and vulnerabilities of modern general-purpose AI along eight widely accepted responsible AI (RAI) principles (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness, safety, truthfulness, governance, and sustainability) and compare how they are non-existent or less severe and easily mitigable in traditional task-specific counterparts. We argue that this is due to the non-deterministically high Degree of Freedom in output (DoFo) of general-purpose AI (unlike the deterministically constant or low DoFo of traditional task-specific AI systems), and there is a need to rethink our approach to RAI for general-purpose AI. Following this, we derive C2V2 (Control, Consistency, Value, Veracity) desiderata to meet the RAI requirements for future general-purpose AI systems, and discuss how recent efforts in AI alignment, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning enhancements, etc. fare along one or more of the desiderata. We believe that the goal of developing responsible general-purpose AI can be achieved by formally modeling application- or domain-dependent RAI requirements along C2V2 dimensions, and taking a system design approach to suitably combine various techniques to meet the desiderata.</description>

      <title>Prompt Injection Mitigation with Agentic AI, Nested Learning, and AI Sustainability via Semantic Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt injection remains a central obstacle to the safe deployment of large language models, particularly in multi-agent settings where intermediate outputs can propagate or amplify malicious instructions. Building on earlier work that introduced a four-metric Total Injection Vulnerability Score (TIVS), this paper extends the evaluation framework with semantic similarity-based caching and a fifth metric (Observability Score Ratio) to yield TIVS-O, investigating how defence effectiveness interacts with transparency in a HOPE-inspired Nested Learning architecture. The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Deadlines Reveal Temporal Awareness Failures in LLM Strategic Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text token-by-token in discrete time, yet real-world communication, from therapy sessions to business negotiations, critically depends on continuous time constraints. Current LLM architectures and evaluation protocols rarely test for temporal awareness under real-time deadlines. We use simulated negotiations between paired agents under strict deadlines to investigate how LLMs adjust their behavior in time-sensitive settings. In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\% vs. 4\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time. However, the same LLMs achieve near-perfect deal closure rates ($\geq$95\%) under turn-based limits, revealing the failure is in temporal tracking rather than strategic reasoning. These effects replicate across negotiation scenarios and models, illustrating a systematic lack of LLM time awareness that will constrain LLM deployment in many time-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>RAG: A Random-Forest-Based Generative Design Framework for Uncertainty-Aware Design of Metamaterials with Complex Functional Response Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials design for advanced functionality often entails the inverse design on nonlinear and condition-dependent responses (e.g., stress-strain relation and dispersion relation), which are described by continuous functions. Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations. Our framework provides a lightweight, trustworthy pathway to inverse design involving functional responses, expensive simulations, and complex design requirements, beyond metamaterials.</description>

      <title>CURE-Med: Curriculum-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Multilingual Medical Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown to perform well on monolingual mathematical and commonsense reasoning, they remain unreliable for multilingual medical reasoning applications, hindering their deployment in multilingual healthcare settings. We address this by first introducing CUREMED-BENCH, a high-quality multilingual medical reasoning dataset with open-ended reasoning queries with a single verifiable answer, spanning thirteen languages, including underrepresented languages such as Amharic, Yoruba, and Swahili. Building on this dataset, we propose CURE-MED, a curriculum-informed reinforcement learning framework that integrates code-switching-aware supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization to jointly improve logical correctness and language stability. Across thirteen languages, our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines and scales effectively, achieving 85.21% language consistency and 54.35% logical correctness at 7B parameters, and 94.96% language consistency and 70.04% logical correctness at 32B parameters. These results support reliable and equitable multilingual medical reasoning in LLMs. The code and dataset are available at https://cure-med.github.io/</description>

      <title>Improving the Safety and Trustworthiness of Medical AI via Multi-Agent Evaluation Loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in healthcare, yet ensuring their ethical integrity and safety compliance remains a major barrier to clinical deployment. This work introduces a multi-agent refinement framework designed to enhance the safety and reliability of medical LLMs through structured, iterative alignment. Our system combines two generative models - DeepSeek R1 and Med-PaLM - with two evaluation agents, LLaMA 3.1 and Phi-4, which assess responses using the American Medical Association's (AMA) Principles of Medical Ethics and a five-tier Safety Risk Assessment (SRA-5) protocol. We evaluate performance across 900 clinically diverse queries spanning nine ethical domains, measuring convergence efficiency, ethical violation reduction, and domain-specific risk behavior. Results demonstrate that DeepSeek R1 achieves faster convergence (mean 2.34 vs. 2.67 iterations), while Med-PaLM shows superior handling of privacy-sensitive scenarios. The iterative multi-agent loop achieved an 89% reduction in ethical violations and a 92% risk downgrade rate, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach. This study presents a scalable, regulator-aligned, and cost-efficient paradigm for governing medical AI safety.</description>

      <title>PepEDiff: Zero-Shot Peptide Binder Design via Protein Embedding Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PepEDiff, a novel peptide binder generator that designs binding sequences given a target receptor protein sequence and its pocket residues. Peptide binder generation is critical in therapeutic and biochemical applications, yet many existing methods rely heavily on intermediate structure prediction, adding complexity and limiting sequence diversity. Our approach departs from this paradigm by generating binder sequences directly in a continuous latent space derived from a pretrained protein embedding model, without relying on predicted structures, thereby improving structural and sequence diversity. To encourage the model to capture binding-relevant features rather than memorizing known sequences, we perform latent-space exploration and diffusion-based sampling, enabling the generation of peptides beyond the limited distribution of known binders. This zero-shot generative strategy leverages the global protein embedding manifold as a semantic prior, allowing the model to propose novel peptide sequences in previously unseen regions of the protein space. We evaluate PepEDiff on TIGIT, a challenging target with a large, flat protein-protein interaction interface that lacks a druggable pocket. Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across benchmark tests and in the TIGIT case study, demonstrating its potential as a general, structure-free framework for zero-shot peptide binder design.

      <title>The Geometry of Thought: How Scale Restructures Reasoning In Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale does not uniformly improve reasoning - it restructures it. Analyzing 25,000+ chain-of-thought trajectories across four domains (Law, Science, Code, Math) and two scales (8B, 70B parameters), we discover that neural scaling laws trigger domain-specific phase transitions rather than uniform capability gains. Legal reasoning undergoes Crystallization: 45% collapse in representational dimensionality (d95: 501 -&gt; 274), 31% increase in trajectory alignment, and 10x manifold untangling. Scientific and mathematical reasoning remain Liquid - geometrically invariant despite 9x parameter increase. Code reasoning forms a discrete Lattice of strategic modes (silhouette: 0.13 -&gt; 0.42). This geometry predicts learnability. We introduce Neural Reasoning Operators - learned mappings from initial to terminal hidden states. In crystalline legal reasoning, our operator achieves 63.6% accuracy on held-out tasks via probe decoding, predicting reasoning endpoints without traversing intermediate states. We further identify a universal oscillatory signature (coherence ~ -0.4) invariant across domains and scales, suggesting attention and feedforward layers drive reasoning through opposing dynamics. These findings establish that the cost of thought is determined not by task difficulty but by manifold geometry - offering a blueprint for inference acceleration where topology permits.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Modular Framework for Constructing Autonomous Agents Driven by Large Language Models: Design, Implementation, and Applications in AgentForge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of LLMs has catalyzed a paradigm shift in autonomous agent development, enabling systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex multi-step tasks. However, existing agent frameworks often suffer from architectural rigidity, vendor lock-in, and prohibitive complexity that impedes rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs and local inference engines, and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development. AgentForge addresses a critical gap in the LLM agent ecosystem by providing researchers and practitioners with a production-ready foundation for constructing, evaluating, and deploying autonomous agents without sacrificing flexibility or performance.</description>

      <title>Explicit Cognitive Allocation: A Principle for Governed and Auditable Inference in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new forms of AI-assisted reasoning across scientific, technical, and organizational domains. However, prevailing modes of LLM use remain cognitively unstructured: problem framing, knowledge exploration, retrieval, methodological awareness, and explanation are typically collapsed into a single generative process. This cognitive collapse limits traceability, weakens epistemic control, and undermines reproducibility, particularly in high-responsibility settings.
  We introduce Explicit Cognitive Allocation, a general principle for structuring AI-assisted inference through the explicit separation and orchestration of epistemic functions. We instantiate this principle in the Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA), an architecture that organizes inference into distinct stages of exploration and framing, epistemic anchoring, instrumental and methodological mapping, and interpretive synthesis. Central to this framework is the notion of Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs), which formalize heterogeneous means, including computational, experimental, organizational, regulatory, and educational instruments, through which abstract inquiries become investigable.
  We evaluate the effects of explicit cognitive and instrumental allocation through controlled comparisons between CUA-orchestrated inference and baseline LLM inference under matched execution conditions. Across multiple prompts in the agricultural domain, CUA inference exhibits earlier and structurally governed epistemic convergence, higher epistemic alignment under semantic expansion, and systematic exposure of the instrumental landscape of inquiry. In contrast, baseline LLM inference shows greater variability in alignment and fails to explicitly surface instrumental structure.</description>

      <title>SpatialBench-UC: Uncertainty-Aware Evaluation of Spatial Prompt Following in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating whether text-to-image models follow explicit spatial instructions is difficult to automate. Object detectors may miss targets or return multiple plausible detections, and simple geometric tests can become ambiguous in borderline cases. Spatial evaluation is naturally a selective prediction problem, the checker may abstain when evidence is weak and report confidence so that results can be interpreted as a risk coverage tradeoff rather than a single score. We introduce SpatialBench-UC, a small, reproducible benchmark for pairwise spatial relations. The benchmark contains 200 prompts (50 object pairs times 4 relations) grouped into 100 counterfactual pairs obtained by swapping object roles. We release a benchmark package, versioned prompts, pinned configs, per-sample checker outputs, and report tables, enabling reproducible and auditable comparisons across models. We also include a lightweight human audit used to calibrate the checker's abstention margin and confidence threshold. We evaluate three baselines, Stable Diffusion 1.5, SD 1.5 BoxDiff, and SD 1.4 GLIGEN. The checker reports pass rate and coverage as well as conditional pass rates on decided samples. The results show that grounding methods substantially improve both pass rate and coverage, while abstention remains a dominant factor due mainly to missing detections.</description>

      <title>Context and Transcripts Improve Detection of Deepfake Audios of Public Figures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans use context to assess the veracity of information. However, current audio deepfake detectors only analyze the audio file without considering either context or transcripts. We create and analyze a Journalist-provided Deepfake Dataset (JDD) of 255 public deepfakes which were primarily contributed by over 70 journalists since early 2024. We also generate a synthetic audio dataset (SYN) of dead public figures and propose a novel Context-based Audio Deepfake Detector (CADD) architecture. In addition, we evaluate performance on two large-scale datasets: ITW and P$^2$V. We show that sufficient context and/or the transcript can significantly improve the efficacy of audio deepfake detectors. Performance (measured via F1 score, AUC, and EER) of multiple baseline audio deepfake detectors and traditional classifiers can be improved by 5%-37.58% in F1-score, 3.77%-42.79% in AUC, and 6.17%-47.83% in EER. We additionally show that CADD, via its use of context and/or transcripts, is more robust to 5 adversarial evasion strategies, limiting performance degradation to an average of just -0.71% across all experiments. Code, models, and datasets are available at our project page: https://sites.northwestern.edu/nsail/cadd-context-based-audio-deepfake-detection (access restricted during review).</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks are Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a single training trajectory can transform a graph neural network into an unsupervised heuristic for combinatorial optimization. Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Robust Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis for Mental Health via Multi-Agent Instruction Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linguistic expressions of emotions such as depression, anxiety, and trauma-related states are pervasive in clinical notes, counseling dialogues, and online mental health communities, and accurate recognition of these emotions is essential for clinical triage, risk assessment, and timely intervention. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization ability in emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes, context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation. Experimental results show that APOLO consistently improves diagnostic accuracy and robustness across domain-specific and stratified benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and generalizable paradigm for trustworthy LLM applications in mental healthcare.</description>

      <title>AgenticRed: Optimizing Agentic Systems for Automated Red-teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent automated red-teaming methods show promise for systematically exposing model vulnerabilities, most existing approaches rely on human-specified workflows. This dependence on manually designed workflows suffers from human biases and makes exploring the broader design space expensive. We introduce AgenticRed, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs' in-context learning to iteratively design and refine red-teaming systems without human intervention. Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench. Our approach exhibits strong transferability to proprietary models, achieving 100% ASR on GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o-mini, and 60% on Claude-Sonnet-3.5 (24% improvement). This work highlights automated system design as a powerful paradigm for AI safety evaluation that can keep pace with rapidly evolving models.</description>

      <title>Reasoning While Recommending: Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning in Generative Re-ranking Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning plays a crucial role in generative re-ranking scenarios due to its exploration-exploitation capabilities, but existing generative methods mostly fail to adapt to the dynamic entropy changes in model difficulty during list generation, making it challenging to accurately capture complex preferences. Given that language models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs by integrating reasoning capabilities, we draw on this approach to introduce a latent reasoning mechanism, and experimental validation demonstrates that this mechanism effectively reduces entropy in the model's decision-making process. Based on these findings, we introduce the Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning (EGLR) recommendation model, which has three core advantages. First, it abandons the "reason first, recommend later" paradigm to achieve "reasoning while recommending", specifically designed for the high-difficulty nature of list generation by enabling real-time reasoning during generation. Second, it implements entropy-guided variable-length reasoning using context-aware reasoning token alongside dynamic temperature adjustment, expanding exploration breadth in reasoning and boosting exploitation precision in recommending to achieve a more precisely adapted exploration-exploitation trade-off. Third, the model adopts a lightweight integration design with no complex independent modules or post-processing, enabling easy adaptation to existing models. Experimental results on two real-world datasets validate the model's effectiveness, and its notable advantage lies in being compatible with existing generative re-ranking models to enhance their performance. Further analyses also demonstrate its practical deployment value and research potential.</description>

      <title>TruthTensor: Evaluating LLMs Human Imitation through Prediction Market Drift and Holistic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating language models and AI agents remains fundamentally challenging because static benchmarks fail to capture real-world uncertainty, distribution shift, and the gap between isolated task accuracy and human-aligned decision-making under evolving conditions. This paper introduces TruthTensor, a novel, reproducible evaluation paradigm that measures Large Language Models (LLMs) not only as prediction engines but as human-imitation systems operating in socially-grounded, high-entropy environments. Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts. We publicly release TruthTensor at https://truthtensor.com</description>

      <title>ChatAD: Reasoning-Enhanced Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Multi-Turn Instruction Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-driven Anomaly Detection (AD) helps enhance the understanding and explanatory abilities of anomalous behaviors in Time Series (TS). Existing methods face challenges of inadequate reasoning ability, deficient multi-turn dialogue capability, and narrow generalization. To this end, we 1) propose a multi-agent-based TS Evolution algorithm named TSEvol. On top of it, we 2) introduce the AD reasoning and multi-turn dialogue Dataset TSEData-20K and contribute the Chatbot family for AD, including ChatAD-Llama3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Mistral-7B. Furthermore, 3) we propose the TS Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (TKTO) to enhance ChatAD's cross-task generalization capability. Lastly, 4) we propose a LLM-driven Learning-based AD Benchmark LLADBench to evaluate the performance of ChatAD and nine baselines across seven datasets and tasks. Our three ChatAD models achieve substantial gains, up to 34.50% in accuracy, 34.71% in F1, and a 37.42% reduction in false positives. Besides, via KTKO, our optimized ChatAD achieves competitive performance in reasoning and cross-task generalization on classification, forecasting, and imputation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging ChatGPT and Other NLP Methods for Identifying Risk and Protective Behaviors in MSM: Social Media and Dating apps Text Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at elevated risk for sexually transmitted infections and harmful drinking compared to heterosexual men. Text data collected from social media and dating applications may provide new opportunities for personalized public health interventions by enabling automatic identification of risk and protective behaviors. In this study, we evaluated whether text from social media and dating apps can be used to predict sexual risk behaviors, alcohol use, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among MSM. With participant consent, we collected textual data and trained machine learning models using features derived from ChatGPT embeddings, BERT embeddings, LIWC, and a dictionary-based risk term approach. The models achieved strong performance in predicting monthly binge drinking and having more than five sexual partners, with F1 scores of 0.78, and moderate performance in predicting PrEP use and heavy drinking, with F1 scores of 0.64 and 0.63. These findings demonstrate that social media and dating app text data can provide valuable insights into risk and protective behaviors and highlight the potential of large language model-based methods to support scalable and personalized public health interventions for MSM.</description>

      <title>AgentGC: Evolutionary Learning-based Lossless Compression for Genomics Data with LLM-driven Multiple Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lossless compression has made significant advancements in Genomics Data (GD) storage, sharing and management. Current learning-based methods are non-evolvable with problems of low-level compression modeling, limited adaptability, and user-unfriendly interface. To this end, we propose AgentGC, the first evolutionary Agent-based GD Compressor, consisting of 3 layers with multi-agent named Leader and Worker. Specifically, the 1) User layer provides a user-friendly interface via Leader combined with LLM; 2) Cognitive layer, driven by the Leader, integrates LLM to consider joint optimization of algorithm-dataset-system, addressing the issues of low-level modeling and limited adaptability; and 3) Compression layer, headed by Worker, performs compression &amp; decompression via a automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression framework. On top of AgentGC, we design 3 modes to support diverse scenarios: CP for compression-ratio priority, TP for throughput priority, and BM for balanced mode. Compared with 14 baselines on 9 datasets, the average compression ratios gains are 16.66%, 16.11%, and 16.33%, the throughput gains are 4.73x, 9.23x, and 9.15x, respectively.</description>

      <title>Reasoning is a Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) provides a compact laboratory for studying abstract reasoning, an ability central to human intelligence. Modern AI systems, including LLMs and ViTs, largely operate as sequence-of-behavior prediction machines: they match observable behaviors by modeling token statistics without a persistent, readable mental state. This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly. Qualitatively, our models exhibit more coherent rule-application structure than the dense ViT baseline, consistent with a shift away from plausible probability blobs toward controller-driven reasoning.</description>

      <title>SCRIPTMIND: Crime Script Inference and Cognitive Evaluation for LLM-based Social Engineering Scam Detection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social engineering scams increasingly employ personalized, multi-turn deception, exposing the limits of traditional detection methods. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in identifying deception, their cognitive assistance potential remains underexplored. We propose ScriptMind, an integrated framework for LLM-based scam detection that bridges automated reasoning and human cognition. It comprises three components: the Crime Script Inference Task (CSIT) for scam reasoning, the Crime Script-Aware Inference Dataset (CSID) for fine-tuning small LLMs, and the Cognitive Simulation-based Evaluation of Social Engineering Defense (CSED) for assessing real-time cognitive impact. Using 571 Korean phone scam cases, we built 22,712 structured scammer-sequence training instances. Experimental results show that the 11B small LLM fine-tuned with ScriptMind outperformed GPT-4o by 13%, achieving superior performance over commercial models in detection accuracy, false-positive reduction, scammer utterance prediction, and rationale quality. Moreover, in phone scam simulation experiments, it significantly enhanced and sustained users' suspicion levels, improving their cognitive awareness of scams. ScriptMind represents a step toward human-centered, cognitively adaptive LLMs for scam defense.</description>

      <title>Motion-to-Response Content Generation via Multi-Agent AI System with Real-Time Safety Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-agent artificial intelligence system that generates response-oriented media content in real time based on audio-derived emotional signals. Unlike conventional speech emotion recognition studies that focus primarily on classification accuracy, our approach emphasizes the transformation of inferred emotional states into safe, age-appropriate, and controllable response content through a structured pipeline of specialized AI agents. The proposed system comprises four cooperative agents: (1) an Emotion Recognition Agent with CNN-based acoustic feature extraction, (2) a Response Policy Decision Agent for mapping emotions to response modes, (3) a Content Parameter Generation Agent for producing media control parameters, and (4) a Safety Verification Agent enforcing age-appropriateness and stimulation constraints. We introduce an explicit safety verification loop that filters generated content before output, ensuring compliance with predefined rules. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the system achieves 73.2% emotion recognition accuracy, 89.4% response mode consistency, and 100% safety compliance while maintaining sub-100ms inference latency suitable for on-device deployment. The modular architecture enables interpretability and extensibility, making it applicable to child-adjacent media, therapeutic applications, and emotionally responsive smart devices.</description>

      <title>DSAEval: Evaluating Data Science Agents on a Wide Range of Real-World Data Science Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent LLM-based data agents aim to automate data science tasks ranging from data analysis to deep learning. However, the open-ended nature of real-world data science problems, which often span multiple taxonomies and lack standard answers, poses a significant challenge for evaluation. To address this, we introduce DSAEval, a benchmark comprising 641 real-world data science problems grounded in 285 diverse datasets, covering both structured and unstructured data (e.g., vision and text). DSAEval incorporates three distinctive features: (1) Multimodal Environment Perception, which enables agents to interpret observations from multiple modalities including text and vision; (2) Multi-Query Interactions, which mirror the iterative and cumulative nature of real-world data science projects; and (3) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation, which provides a holistic assessment across reasoning, code, and results. We systematically evaluate 11 advanced agentic LLMs using DSAEval. Our results show that Claude-Sonnet-4.5 achieves the strongest overall performance, GPT-5.2 is the most efficient, and MiMo-V2-Flash is the most cost-effective. We further demonstrate that multimodal perception consistently improves performance on vision-related tasks, with gains ranging from 2.04% to 11.30%. Overall, while current data science agents perform well on structured data and routine data anlysis workflows, substantial challenges remain in unstructured domains. Finally, we offer critical insights and outline future research directions to advance the development of data science agents.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Global Consistency Checking with Noisy LLM Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that collections of natural-language facts are globally consistent is essential for tasks such as fact-checking, summarization, and knowledge base construction. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can assess the consistency of small subsets of facts, their judgments are noisy, and pairwise checks are insufficient to guarantee global coherence. We formalize this problem and show that verifying global consistency requires exponentially many oracle queries in the worst case. To make the task practical, we propose an adaptive divide-and-conquer algorithm that identifies minimal inconsistent subsets (MUSes) of facts and optionally computes minimal repairs through hitting-sets. Our approach has low-degree polynomial query complexity. Experiments with both synthetic and real LLM oracles show that our method efficiently detects and localizes inconsistencies, offering a scalable framework for linguistic consistency verification with LLM-based evaluators.</description>

      <title>Resilient Routing: Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing in Smart Logistics via Spatiotemporal Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of the e-commerce industry, the logistics network is experiencing unprecedented pressure. The traditional static routing strategy most time cannot tolerate the traffic congestion and fluctuating retail demand. In this paper, we propose a Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing(RADR) framework which integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with combinatorial optimization. We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain. Particularly in the case study of high congestion scenarios, our method reduces the potential congestion risk exposure by 19.3% while only increasing the transportation distance by 2.1%. This empirical evidence confirms that the proposed data-driven approach can effectively balance delivery efficiency and operational safety.</description>

      <title>Understanding Mental States to Guide Social Influence in Multi-Person Group Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing dynamic Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks mostly place language models in a passive role: the model reads a sequence of connected scenarios and reports what people believe, feel, intend, and do as these states change. In real social interaction, ToM is also used for action: a speaker plans what to say in order to shift another person's mental-state trajectory toward a goal. We introduce SocialMindChange, a benchmark that moves from tracking minds to changing minds in social interaction. Each instance defines a social context with 4 characters and five connected scenes. The model plays one character and generates dialogue across the five scenes to reach the target while remaining consistent with the evolving states of all participants. SocialMindChange also includes selected higher-order states. Using a structured four-step framework, we construct 1,200 social contexts, covering 6000 scenarios and over 90,000 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Evaluations on ten state-of-the-art LLMs show that their average performance is 54.2% below human performance. This gap suggests that current LLMs still struggle to maintain and change mental-state representations across long, linked interactions.</description>

      <title>Hidden in Plain Text: Measuring LLM Deception Quality Against Human Baselines Using Social Deduction Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly used in many applications, raising concerns about their safety. While previous work has shown that LLMs can deceive in controlled tasks, less is known about their ability to deceive using natural language in social contexts. In this paper, we study deception in the Social Deduction Game (SDG) Mafia, where success is dependent on deceiving others through conversation. Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research. Our findings underscore both the sophistication and risks of LLM deception in social contexts.</description>

      <title>Reasoning or Fluency? Dissecting Probabilistic Confidence in Best-of-N Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic confidence metrics are increasingly adopted as proxies for reasoning quality in Best-of-N selection, under the assumption that higher confidence reflects higher reasoning fidelity. In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether these metrics truly capture inter-step causal dependencies necessary for valid reasoning. We introduce three classes of inter-step causality perturbations that systematically disrupt dependencies between reasoning steps while preserving local fluency. Surprisingly, across diverse model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that selection accuracy degrades only marginally under these disruptions. Even severe interventions, such as applying hard attention masks that directly prevent the model from attending to prior reasoning steps, do not substantially reduce selection performance. These findings provide strong evidence that current probabilistic metrics are largely insensitive to logical structure, and primarily capture surface-level fluency or in-distribution priors instead. Motivated by this gap, we propose a contrastive causality metric that explicitly isolates inter-step causal dependencies, and demonstrate that it yields more faithful output selection than existing probability-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Finding RELIEF: Shaping Reasoning Behavior without Reasoning Supervision via Belief Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex problem-solving, yet they often suffer from computational redundancy or reasoning unfaithfulness. Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs. Further analysis validates that shifting a model's reasoning belief effectively shapes its actual behavior.</description>

      <title>DARC: Decoupled Asymmetric Reasoning Curriculum for LLM Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-play with large language models has emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving self-improving artificial intelligence. However, existing self-play frameworks often suffer from optimization instability, due to (i) non-stationary objectives induced by solver-dependent reward feedback for the Questioner, and (ii) bootstrapping errors from self-generated pseudo-labels used to supervise the Solver. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce DARC (Decoupled Asymmetric Reasoning Curriculum), a two-stage framework that stabilizes the self-evolution process. First, we train the Questioner to synthesize difficulty-calibrated questions, conditioned on explicit difficulty levels and external corpora. Second, we train the Solver with an asymmetric self-distillation mechanism, where a document-augmented teacher generates high-quality pseudo-labels to supervise the student Solver that lacks document access. Empirical results demonstrate that DARC is model-agnostic, yielding an average improvement of 10.9 points across nine reasoning benchmarks and three backbone models. Moreover, DARC consistently outperforms all baselines and approaches the performance of fully supervised models without relying on human annotations.The code is available at https://github.com/RUCBM/DARC.</description>

      <title>Look-Ahead-Bench: a Standardized Benchmark of Look-ahead Bias in Point-in-Time LLMs for Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Look-Ahead-Bench, a standardized benchmark measuring look-ahead bias in Point-in-Time (PiT) Large Language Models (LLMs) within realistic and practical financial workflows. Unlike most existing approaches that primarily test inner lookahead knowledge via Q\\&amp;A, our benchmark evaluates model behavior in practical scenarios. To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size. This work establishes a foundation for the standardized evaluation of temporal bias in financial LLMs and provides a practical framework for identifying models suitable for real-world deployment.

      <title>Virtual Urbanism: An AI-Driven Framework for Quantifying Urban Identity. A Tokyo-Based Pilot Study Using Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Virtual Urbanism (VU), a multimodal AI-driven analytical framework for quantifying urban identity through the medium of synthetic urban replicas. The framework aims to advance computationally tractable urban identity metrics. To demonstrate feasibility, the pilot study Virtual Urbanism and Tokyo Microcosms is presented. A pipeline integrating Stable Diffusion and LoRA models was used to produce synthetic replicas of nine Tokyo areas rendered as dynamic synthetic urban sequences, excluding existing orientation markers to elicit core identity-forming elements. Human-evaluation experiments (I) assessed perceptual legitimacy of replicas; (II) quantified area-level identity; (III) derived core identity-forming elements. Results showed a mean identification accuracy of ~81%, confirming the validity of the replicas. Urban Identity Level (UIL) metric enabled assessment of identity levels across areas, while semantic analysis revealed culturally embedded typologies as core identity-forming elements, positioning VU as a viable framework for AI-augmented urban analysis, outlining a path toward automated, multi-parameter identity metrics.</description>

      <title>LifeAgentBench: A Multi-dimensional Benchmark and Agent for Personal Health Assistants in Digital Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized digital health support requires long-horizon, cross-dimensional reasoning over heterogeneous lifestyle signals, and recent advances in mobile sensing and large language models (LLMs) make such support increasingly feasible. However, the capabilities of current LLMs in this setting remain unclear due to the lack of systematic benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce LifeAgentBench, a large-scale QA benchmark for long-horizon, cross-dimensional, and multi-user lifestyle health reasoning, containing 22,573 questions spanning from basic retrieval to complex reasoning. We release an extensible benchmark construction pipeline and a standardized evaluation protocol to enable reliable and scalable assessment of LLM-based health assistants. We then systematically evaluate 11 leading LLMs on LifeAgentBench and identify key bottlenecks in long-horizon aggregation and cross-dimensional reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we propose LifeAgent as a strong baseline agent for health assistant that integrates multi-step evidence retrieval with deterministic aggregation, achieving significant improvements compared with two widely used baselines. Case studies further demonstrate its potential in realistic daily-life scenarios. The benchmark is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LifeAgentBench-CE7B.</description>

      <title>Human Simulation Computation: A Human-Inspired Framework for Adaptive AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in knowledge representation and reasoning based on textual data. However, their reliance on language material alone limits their ability to adapt, verify reasoning outcomes, and operate effectively in open and dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose Human Simulation Computation (HSC), a human-inspired computational framework that models intelligence as a continuous, closed-loop process involving thinking, action, learning, reflection, and activity scheduling, collectively referred to as the internal reasoning process. HSC emphasizes active participation both within the internal reasoning process and in interactions with the environment, where actions are used not only to achieve goals but also to automatically refine and improve internal reasoning mechanisms without external intervention. Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis, we argue that human simulation strategies cannot be fully learned from language material alone, and that human-like reasoning processes and action-grounded reasoning methods are essential for robust adaptation and effective interaction with real-world environments.</description>

      <title>PREFAB: PREFerence-based Affective Modeling for Low-Budget Self-Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-annotation is the gold standard for collecting affective state labels in affective computing. Existing methods typically rely on full annotation, requiring users to continuously label affective states across entire sessions. While this process yields fine-grained data, it is time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to fatigue and errors. To address these issues, we present PREFAB, a low-budget retrospective self-annotation method that targets affective inflection regions rather than full annotation. Grounded in the peak-end rule and ordinal representations of emotion, PREFAB employs a preference-learning model to detect relative affective changes, directing annotators to label only selected segments while interpolating the remainder of the stimulus. We further introduce a preview mechanism that provides brief contextual cues to assist annotation. We evaluate PREFAB through a technical performance study and a 25-participant user study. Results show that PREFAB outperforms baselines in modeling affective inflections while mitigating workload (and conditionally mitigating temporal burden). Importantly PREFAB improves annotator confidence without degrading annotation quality.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Knowledge Graph Exploration with Adaptive Breadth-Depth Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieving evidence for language model queries from knowledge graphs requires balancing broad search across the graph with multi-hop traversal to follow relational links. Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate.</description>

      <title>Numina-Lean-Agent: An Open and General Agentic Reasoning System for Formal Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic systems have recently become the dominant paradigm for formal theorem proving, achieving strong performance by coordinating multiple models and tools. However, existing approaches often rely on task-specific pipelines and trained formal provers, limiting their flexibility and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the paradigm that directly uses a general coding agent as a formal math reasoner. This paradigm is motivated by (1) A general coding agent provides a natural interface for diverse reasoning tasks beyond proving, (2) Performance can be improved by simply replacing the underlying base model, without training, and (3) MCP enables flexible extension and autonomous calling of specialized tools, avoiding complex design. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Numina-Lean-Agent, which combines Claude Code with Numina-Lean-MCP to enable autonomous interaction with Lean, retrieval of relevant theorems, informal proving and auxiliary reasoning tools. Using Claude Opus 4.5 as the base model, Numina-Lean-Agent solves all problems in Putnam 2025 (12 / 12), matching the best closed-source system. Beyond benchmark evaluation, we further demonstrate its generality by interacting with mathematicians to successfully formalize the Brascamp-Lieb theorem. We release Numina-Lean-Agent and all solutions at https://github.com/project-numina/numina-lean-agent.</description>

      <title>Remapping and navigation of an embedding space via error minimization: a fundamental organizational principle of cognition in natural and artificial systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of diverse intelligence seeks an integrated view of problem-solving in agents of very different provenance, composition, and substrates. From subcellular chemical networks to swarms of organisms, and across evolved, engineered, and chimeric systems, it is hypothesized that scale-invariant principles of decision-making can be discovered. We propose that cognition in both natural and synthetic systems can be characterized and understood by the interplay between two equally important invariants: (1) the remapping of embedding spaces, and (2) the navigation within these spaces. Biological collectives, from single cells to entire organisms (and beyond), remap transcriptional, morphological, physiological, or 3D spaces to maintain homeostasis and regenerate structure, while navigating these spaces through distributed error correction. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata enact analogous processes by remapping data into latent embeddings and refining them iteratively through contextualization. We argue that this dual principle - remapping and navigation of embedding spaces via iterative error minimization - constitutes a substrate-independent invariant of cognition. Recognizing this shared mechanism not only illuminates deep parallels between living systems and artificial models, but also provides a unifying framework for engineering adaptive intelligence across scales.</description>

      <title>Paper2Rebuttal: A Multi-Agent Framework for Transparent Author Response Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Writing effective rebuttals is a high-stakes task that demands more than linguistic fluency, as it requires precise alignment between reviewer intent and manuscript details. Current solutions typically treat this as a direct-to-text generation problem, suffering from hallucination, overlooked critiques, and a lack of verifiable grounding. To address these limitations, we introduce $\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$, the first multi-agents framework that reframes rebuttal generation as an evidence-centric planning task. Our system decomposes complex feedback into atomic concerns and dynamically constructs hybrid contexts by synthesizing compressed summaries with high-fidelity text while integrating an autonomous and on-demand external search module to resolve concerns requiring outside literature. By generating an inspectable response plan before drafting, $\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$ ensures that every argument is explicitly anchored in internal or external evidence. We validate our approach on the proposed $\textbf{RebuttalBench}$ and demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms strong baselines in coverage, faithfulness, and strategic coherence, offering a transparent and controllable assistant for the peer review process. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient Agents: Memory, Tool learning, and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in extending large language models into agentic systems. While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies. Moreover, we discuss the key challenges and future directions, with the goal of providing promising insights.</description>

      <title>Chatsparent: An Interactive System for Detecting and Mitigating Cognitive Fatigue in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs are increasingly being deployed as chatbots, but today's interfaces offer little to no friction: users interact through seamless conversations that conceal when the model is drifting, hallucinating or failing. This lack of transparency fosters blind trust, even as models produce unstable or repetitive outputs. We introduce an interactive demo that surfaces and mitigates cognitive fatigue, a failure mode where LLMs gradually lose coherence during auto-regressive generation. Our system, Chatsparent, instruments real-time, token-level signals of fatigue, including attention-to-prompt decay, embedding drift, and entropy collapse, and visualizes them as a unified fatigue index. When fatigue thresholds are crossed, the interface allows users to activate lightweight interventions such as attention resets, entropy-regularized decoding, and self-reflection checkpoints. The demo streams live text and fatigue signals, allowing users to observe when fatigue arises, how it affects output quality, and how interventions restore stability. By turning passive chatbot interaction into an interactive diagnostic experience, our system empowers users to better understand LLM behavior while improving reliability at inference time.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Give Good Romantic Relationship Advice? A Study on User Satisfaction and Attitude Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to provide support and advice in personal domains such as romantic relationships, yet little is known about user perceptions of this type of advice. This study investigated how people evaluate advice on LLM-generated romantic relationships. Participants rated advice satisfaction, model reliability, and helpfulness, and completed pre- and post-measures of their general attitudes toward LLMs. Overall, the results showed participants' high satisfaction with LLM-generated advice. Greater satisfaction was, in turn, strongly and positively associated with their perceptions of the models' reliability and helpfulness. Importantly, participants' attitudes toward LLMs improved significantly after exposure to the advice, suggesting that supportive and contextually relevant advice can enhance users' trust and openness toward these AI systems.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graph Construction for Stock Markets with LLM-Based Explainable Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stock market is inherently complex, with interdependent relationships among companies, sectors, and financial indicators. Traditional research has largely focused on time-series forecasting and single-company analysis, relying on numerical data for stock price prediction. While such approaches can provide short-term insights, they are limited in capturing relational patterns, competitive dynamics, and explainable investment reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge graph schema specifically designed for the stock market, modeling companies, sectors, stock indicators, financial statements, and inter-company relationships. By integrating this schema with large language models (LLMs), our approach enables multi-hop reasoning and relational queries, producing explainable and in-depth answers to complex financial questions. Figure1 illustrates the system pipeline, detailing the flow from data collection and graph construction to LLM-based query processing and answer generation. We validate the proposed framework through practical case studies on Korean listed companies, demonstrating its capability to extract insights that are difficult or impossible to obtain from traditional database queries alone. The results highlight the potential of combining knowledge graphs with LLMs for advanced investment analysis and decision support.</description>

      <title>SNAP: A Plan-Driven Framework for Controllable Interactive Narrative Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold great potential for web-based interactive applications, including browser games, online education, and digital storytelling platforms. However, LLM-based conversational agents suffer from spatiotemporal distortions when responding to variant user inputs, failing to maintain consistency with provided scenarios. We propose SNAP (Story and Narrative-based Agent with Planning), a framework that structures narratives into Cells with explicit Plans to prevent narrative drift in web environments. By confining context within each Cell and employing detailed plans that specify spatiotemporal settings, character actions, and plot developments, SNAP enables coherent and scenario-consistent dialogues while adapting to diverse user responses. Via automated and human evaluations, we validate SNAP's superiority in narrative controllability, demonstrating effective scenario consistency despite variant user inputs in web-based interactive storytelling.</description>

      <title>AI for Proactive Mental Health: A Multi-Institutional, Longitudinal, Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young adults today face unprecedented mental health challenges, yet many hesitate to seek support due to barriers such as accessibility, stigma, and time constraints. Bite-sized well-being interventions offer a promising solution to preventing mental distress before it escalates to clinical levels, but have not yet been delivered through personalized, interactive, and scalable technology. We conducted the first multi-institutional, longitudinal, preregistered randomized controlled trial of a generative AI-powered mobile app ("Flourish") designed to address this gap. Over six weeks in Fall 2024, 486 undergraduate students from three U.S. institutions were randomized to receive app access or waitlist control. Participants in the treatment condition reported significantly greater positive affect, resilience, and social well-being (i.e., increased belonging, closeness to community, and reduced loneliness) and were buffered against declines in mindfulness and flourishing. These findings suggest that, with purposeful and ethical design, generative AI can deliver proactive, population-level well-being interventions that produce measurable benefits.</description>

      <title>NOVAID: Natural-language Observability Visualization Assistant for ITOps Dashboard Widget Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manual creation of IT monitoring dashboard widgets is slow, error-prone, and a barrier for both novice and expert users. We present NOVAID, an interactive chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate IT monitoring widgets directly from natural language queries. Unlike general natural language-to-visualization tools, NOVAID addresses IT operations-specific challenges: specialized widget types like SLO charts, dynamic API-driven data retrieval, and complex contextual filters. The system combines a domain-aware semantic parser, fuzzy entity matching, and schema completion to produce standardized widget JSON specifications. An interactive clarification loop ensures accuracy in underspecified queries. On a curated dataset of 271 realistic queries, NOVAID achieves promising accuracy (up to 94.10% in metric extraction) across multiple LLMs. A user study with IT engineers yielded a System Usability Scale score of 74.2 for NOVAID, indicating good usability. By bridging natural language intent with operational dashboards, NOVAID demonstrates clear potential and a path for deployment in enterprise ITOps monitoring platforms.</description>

Abstract: This project explores how we engage with AI-generated content through the lens of the jutter: Dutch coastal foragers who comb the shoreline after storms, gathering and repurposing what the sea leaves behind. Reflecting how our lives are increasingly shaped by AI-generated media, we create a beach-like installation that blends real shoreline debris with AI-transformed images and videos. Visitors are invited to explore this space as contemporary jutters, deciding what to keep and what to discard. In doing so, the project reimagines AI-imagery as material for reflection, encouraging a more discerning engagement with the content that drifts through our feeds. A video preview of the installation can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6319Ii7MT8.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence as a Training Tool in Clinical Psychology: A Comparison of Text-Based and Avatar Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical psychology students frequently report feeling underprepared for the interpersonal demands of therapeutic work, highlighting the need for accessible opportunities to practise core counselling skills before seeing real clients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) now enable simulated interaction partners that may support early skills development. This study examined postgraduate clinical psychology students' perceptions of two AI-based simulations: a text-based chatbot (ChatGPT) and a voice-based avatar (HeyGen). Twenty-four students completed two brief cognitive-behavioural role-plays (counterbalanced), one with each tool, and provided both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on perceived usefulness, skill application, responsiveness and engagement, and perceived skill improvement. Both AI tools were evaluated positively across dimensions. However, the avatar was rated significantly higher than the chatbot for perceived usefulness, skill application, and perceived skill improvement, and qualitative comments highlighted the added value of voice-based interaction for conveying social and emotional cues. These findings suggest that AI-driven simulation may supplement early-stage clinical skills training, with voice-based avatars offering additional benefits. Future work should test whether such simulated interactions translate to objective improvements in real therapeutic performance.</description>

      <title>Modular AI-Powered Interviewer with Dynamic Question Generation and Expertise Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated interviewers and chatbots are common in research, recruitment, customer service, and education. Many existing systems use fixed question lists, strict rules, and limited personalization, leading to repeated conversations that cause low engagement. Therefore, these tools are not effective for complex qualitative research, which requires flexibility, context awareness, and ethical sensitivity. Consequently, there is a need for a more adaptive and context-aware interviewing system. To address this, an AI-powered interviewer that dynamically generates questions that are contextually appropriate and expertise aligned is presented in this study. The interviewer is built on a locally hosted large language model (LLM) that generates coherent dialogue while preserving data privacy. The interviewer profiles the participants' expertise in real time to generate knowledge-appropriate questions, well-articulated responses, and smooth transition messages similar to human-like interviews. To implement these functionalities, a modular prompt engineering pipeline was designed to ensure that the interview conversation remains scalable, adaptive, and semantically rich. To evaluate the AI-powered interviewer, it was tested with various participants, and it achieved high satisfaction (mean 4.45) and engagement (mean 4.33). The proposed interviewer is a scalable, privacy-conscious solution that advances AI-assisted qualitative data collection.</description>

      <title>Augmented Assembly: Object Recognition and Hand Tracking for Adaptive Assembly Instructions in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in augmented reality (AR) have enabled interactive systems that assist users in physical assembly tasks. In this paper, we present an AR-assisted assembly workflow that leverages object recognition and hand tracking to (1) identify custom components, (2) display step-by-step instructions, (3) detect assembly deviations, and (4) dynamically update the instructions based on users' hands-on interactions with physical parts. Using object recognition, the system detects and localizes components in real time to create a digital twin of the workspace. For each assembly step, it overlays bounding boxes in AR to indicate both the current position and the target placement of relevant components, while hand-tracking data verifies whether the user interacts with the correct part. Rather than enforcing a fixed sequence, the system highlights potential assembly errors and interprets user deviations as opportunities for iteration and creative exploration. A case study with LEGO blocks and custom 3D-printed components demonstrates how the system links digital instructions to physical assembly, eliminating the need for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of parts.</description>

Abstract: Feedback is a critical component of the learning process, particularly in computer science education. This study investigates the quality of feedback generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), compared with human feedback, in three computer science course with technical writing components: an introductory computer science course (CS2), a third-year advanced systems course (operating systems), and a third-year writing course (a topics course on artificial intelligence). Using a mixed-methods approach which integrates quantitative Likert-scale questions with qualitative commentary, we analyze the student perspective on feedback quality, evaluated based on multiple criteria, including readability, detail, specificity, actionability, helpfulness, and overall quality. The analysis reveals that in the larger upper-year operating systems course ($N=80$), SLMs and LLMs are perceived to deliver clear, actionable, and well-structured feedback, while humans provide more contextually nuanced guidance. As for the high-enrollment CS2 course ($N=176$) showed the same preference for the AI tools' clarity and breadth, but students noted that AI feedback sometimes lacked the concise, straight-to-the-point, guidance offered by humans. Conversely, in the smaller upper-year technical writing course on AI topics ($N=7$), all students preferred feedback from the course instructor, who was able to provide clear, specific, and personalized feedback, compared to the more general and less targeted AI-based feedback. We also highlight the scalability of AI-based feedback by focusing on its effectiveness at large scale. Our findings underscore the potential of hybrid approaches that combine AI and human feedback to achieve efficient and high-quality feedback at scale.</description>

      <title>Medication counseling with large language models: balancing flexibility and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of large language models (LLMs) has greatly enhanced the capabilities of software agents. Instead of relying on rule-based interactions, agents can now interact in flexible ways akin to humans. However, this flexibility quickly becomes a problem in fields where errors can be disastrous, such as in a pharmacy context, but the opposite also holds true; a system that is too inflexible will also lead to errors, as it can become too rigid to handle situations that are not accounted for. Work using LLMs in a pharmacy context have adopted a wide scope, accounting for many different medications in brief interactions -- our strategy is the opposite: focus on a more narrow and long task. This not only enables a greater understanding of the task at hand, but also provides insight into what challenges are present in an interaction of longer nature. The main challenge, however, remains the same for a narrow and wide system: it needs to strike a balance between adherence to conversational requirements and flexibility. In an effort to strike such a balance, we present a prototype system meant to provide medication counseling while juggling these two extremes. We also cover our design in constructing such a system, with a focus on methods aiming to fulfill conversation requirements, reduce hallucinations and promote high-quality responses. The methods used have the potential to increase the determinism of the system, while simultaneously not removing the dynamic conversational abilities granted by the usage of LLMs. However, a great deal of work remains ahead, and the development of this kind of system needs to involve continuous testing and a human-in-the-loop. It should also be evaluated outside of commonly used benchmarks for LLMs, as these do not adequately capture the complexities of this kind of conversational system.</description>

      <title>CSyMR: Benchmarking Compositional Symbolic Muisc Reasoning With MIR Tool Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are leveraged in symbolic music reasoning, yet existing benchmarks emphasize isolated knowledge or atomic analyses rather than the integrative compositional reasoning needed to connect musical structures. To address this, we present the Compositional Symbolic Music Reasoning Benchmark (CSyMR-Bench), a curated multiple-choice dataset of 126 questions derived from expert forums and professional examinations. Each item involves combining several atomic analyses to arrive at the final answer. Furthermore, we introduce a tool-augmented agent framework that leverages symbolic music analysis tools from the music21 library to address the challenges posed by CSyMR-Bench. Experiments validate that CSyMR-Bench poses a non-trivial challenge across both community-sourced and exam-style questions, while our tool-augmented agent consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving 5-7% absolute accuracy gains.</description>

      <title>DeepEvidence: Empowering Biomedical Discovery with Deep Knowledge Graph Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) encode vast, heterogeneous information spanning literature, genes, pathways, drugs, diseases, and clinical trials, but leveraging them collectively for scientific discovery remains difficult. Their structural differences, continual evolution, and limited cross-resource alignment require substantial manual integration, limiting the depth and scale of knowledge exploration. We introduce DeepEvidence, an AI-agent framework designed to perform Deep Research across various heterogeneous biomedical KGs. Unlike generic Deep Research systems that rely primarily on internet-scale text, DeepEvidence incorporates specialized knowledge-graph tooling and coordinated exploration strategies to systematically bridge heterogeneous resources. At its core is an orchestrator that directs two complementary agents: Breadth-First ReSearch (BFRS) for broad, multi-graph entity search, and Depth-First ReSearch (DFRS) for multi-hop, evidence-focused reasoning. An internal, incrementally built evidence graph provides a structured record of retrieved entities, relations, and supporting evidence. To operate at scale, DeepEvidence includes unified interfaces for querying diverse biomedical APIs and an execution sandbox that enables programmatic data retrieval, extraction, and analysis. Across established deep-reasoning benchmarks and four key stages of the biomedical discovery lifecycle: drug discovery, pre-clinical experimentation, clinical trial development, and evidence-based medicine, DeepEvidence demonstrates substantial gains in systematic exploration and evidence synthesis. These results highlight the potential of knowledge-graph-driven Deep Research to accelerate biomedical discovery.</description>

      <title>Context Discipline and Performance Correlation: Analyzing LLM Performance and Quality Degradation Under Varying Context Lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling trend in Large Language Models (LLMs) has prioritized increasing the maximum context window to facilitate complex, long-form reasoning and document analysis. However, managing this expanded context introduces severe computational overhead. This paper investigates the critical trade-off between system performance and model quality when dense transformer architectures--specifically Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen1.5-14B--are exposed to large volumes of irrelevant and distracting context. The research identifies a non-linear performance degradation tied to the growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Furthermore, an extended analysis of the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture reveals unique behavioral anomalies at varying context scales, suggesting that architectural benefits may be masked by infrastructure bottlenecks at high token volumes.</description>

      <title>Compass-Embedding v4: Robust Contrastive Learning for Multilingual E-commerce Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As global e-commerce rapidly expands into emerging markets, the lack of high-quality semantic representations for low-resource languages has become a decisive bottleneck for retrieval, recommendation, and search systems. In this work, we present Compass-Embedding v4, a high-efficiency multilingual embedding framework specifically optimized for Southeast Asian (SEA) e-commerce scenarios, where data scarcity, noisy supervision, and strict production constraints jointly challenge representation learning. Compass-Embedding v4 addresses three core challenges. First, large-batch contrastive training under mixed task supervision introduces systematic false negatives that degrade semantic alignment. We propose Class-Aware Masking (CAM), a lightweight modification to the InfoNCE objective that suppresses invalid in-batch negatives and improves semantic discrimination without altering training efficiency. Second, low-resource SEA languages suffer from limited and uneven data coverage. We construct a diversified training corpus through context-grounded synthetic data generation, cross-lingual translation, and structured e-commerce data construction, enabling robust multilingual and domain-specific learning. Third, production deployment requires high-throughput inference while preserving embedding quality. We combine robustness-driven large-batch training with spherical model merging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and optimize inference via vLLM and FP8 quantization. Extensive evaluations across multilingual benchmarks and proprietary e-commerce tasks show that Compass-Embedding v4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major SEA languages, significantly outperforming general-purpose embedding models in domain-specific retrieval and classification, while maintaining competitive performance on high-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Measuring Stability Beyond Accuracy in Small Open-Source Medical Large Language Models for Pediatric Endocrinology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small open-source medical large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for low-resource deployment and broader accessibility. However, their evaluation is often limited to accuracy on medical multiple choice question (MCQ) benchmarks, and lacks evaluation of consistency, robustness, or reasoning behavior. We use MCQ coupled to human evaluation and clinical review to assess six small open-source medical LLMs (HuatuoGPT-o1 (Chen 2024), Diabetica-7B, Diabetica-o1 (Wei 2024), Meditron3-8B (Sallinen2025), MedFound-7B (Liu 2025), and ClinicaGPT-base-zh (Wang 2023)) in pediatric endocrinology. In deterministic settings, we examine the effect of prompt variation on models' output and self-assessment bias. In stochastic settings, we evaluate output variability and investigate the relationship between consistency and correctness. HuatuoGPT-o1-8B achieved the highest performance. The results show that high consistency across the model response is not an indicator of correctness, although HuatuoGPT-o1-8B showed the highest consistency rate. When tasked with selecting correct reasoning, both HuatuoGPT-o1-8B and Diabetica-o1 exhibit self-assessment bias and dependency on the order of the candidate explanations. Expert review of incorrect reasoning rationales identified a mix of clinically acceptable responses and clinical oversight. We further show that system-level perturbations, such as differences in CUDA builds, can yield statistically significant shifts in model output despite stable accuracy. This work demonstrates that small, semantically negligible prompt perturbations lead to divergent outputs, raising concerns about reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations and highlights the output variability under different stochastic regimes, emphasizing the need of a broader diagnostic framework to understand potential pitfalls in real-world clinical decision support scenarios.</description>

      <title>AdaFRUGAL: Adaptive Memory-Efficient Training with Dynamic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly memory-intensive due to optimizer state overhead. The FRUGAL framework mitigates this with gradient splitting, but its static hyperparameters -- the subspace ratio ($\rho$) and update frequency ($T$) -- require costly manual tuning, limiting adaptability. We present AdaFRUGAL, which automates this process by introducing two dynamic controls: (i) a linear decay for $\rho$ to progressively reduce memory, and (ii) a loss-aware schedule for $T$ to lower computational overhead. Experiments across large-scale pre-training (English C4, Vietnamese VietVault) and fine-tuning (GLUE) demonstrate that AdaFRUGAL achieves a compelling trade-off. It maintains competitive performance against AdamW and static FRUGAL while significantly reducing both GPU memory and training time, offering a more practical, autonomous solution for resource-constrained LLM training.</description>

      <title>Discrete Semantic States and Hamiltonian Dynamics in LLM Embedding Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of Large Language Model (LLM) embedding spaces using mathematical concepts, particularly linear algebra and the Hamiltonian formalism, drawing inspiration from analogies with quantum mechanical systems. Motivated by the observation that LLM embeddings exhibit distinct states, suggesting discrete semantic representations, we explore the application of these mathematical tools to analyze semantic relationships. We demonstrate that the L2 normalization constraint, a characteristic of many LLM architectures, results in a structured embedding space suitable for analysis using a Hamiltonian formalism. We derive relationships between cosine similarity and perturbations of embedding vectors, and explore direct and indirect semantic transitions. Furthermore, we explore a quantum-inspired perspective, deriving an analogue of zero-point energy and discussing potential connections to Koopman-von Neumann mechanics. While the interpretation warrants careful consideration, our results suggest that this approach offers a promising avenue for gaining deeper insights into LLMs and potentially informing new methods for mitigating hallucinations.</description>

      <title>GRADE: Replacing Policy Gradients with Backpropagation for LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant paradigm for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, policy gradient methods such as PPO suffer from high variance gradient estimates, requiring careful hyperparameter tuning and extensive computational resources. We introduce GRADE (Gumbel-softmax Relaxation for Alignment via Differentiable Estimation), a method that replaces high-variance policy gradient estimation with direct backpropagation through a differentiable relaxation of the discrete token sampling process. Using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization with straight-through estimation (GRADE-STE), we enable end-to-end gradient flow from reward signals through generated tokens to model parameters. On sentiment-controlled text generation using the IMDB dataset, GRADE-STE achieves a test reward of 0.763 +- 0.344 compared to PPO's 0.510 +- 0.313 and REINFORCE's 0.617 +- 0.378, representing a 50% relative improvement over PPO. Critically, GRADE-STE exhibits gradient variance over 14 times lower than REINFORCE and maintains stable training dynamics throughout optimization. Our rigorous evaluation with proper train/validation/test splits demonstrates that these improvements generalize to held-out data, with GRADE-STE showing the best generalization characteristics among all methods tested. GRADE offers a simpler, more stable, and more effective alternative to reinforcement learning for LLM alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often map semantically related prompts to similar internal representations at specific layers, even when their surface forms differ widely. We show that this behavior can be explained through Iterated Function Systems (IFS), where layers act as contractive mappings toward concept-specific Attractors. We leverage this insight and develop simple, training-free methods that operate directly on these Attractors to solve a wide range of practical tasks, including language translation, hallucination reduction, guardrailing, and synthetic data generation. Despite their simplicity, these Attractor-based interventions match or exceed specialized baselines, offering an efficient alternative to heavy fine-tuning, generalizable in scenarios where baselines underperform.</description>

      <title>LimAgents: Multi-Agent LLMs for Generating Research Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and articulating limitations is essential for transparent and rigorous scientific research. However, zero-shot large language models (LLMs) approach often produce superficial or general limitation statements (e.g., dataset bias or generalizability). They usually repeat limitations reported by authors without looking at deeper methodological issues and contextual gaps. This problem is made worse because many authors disclose only partial or trivial limitations. We propose LimAgents, a multi-agent LLM framework for generating substantive limitations. LimAgents integrates OpenReview comments and author-stated limitations to provide stronger ground truth. It also uses cited and citing papers to capture broader contextual weaknesses. In this setup, different agents have specific roles as sequential role: some extract explicit limitations, others analyze methodological gaps, some simulate the viewpoint of a peer reviewer, and a citation agent places the work within the larger body of literature. A Judge agent refines their outputs, and a Master agent consolidates them into a clear set. This structure allows for systematic identification of explicit, implicit, peer review-focused, and literature-informed limitations. Moreover, traditional NLP metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and cosine similarity rely heavily on n-gram or embedding overlap. They often overlook semantically similar limitations. To address this, we introduce a pointwise evaluation protocol that uses an LLM-as-a-Judge to measure coverage more accurately. Experiments show that LimAgents substantially improve performance. The RAG + multi-agent GPT-4o mini configuration achieves a +15.51% coverage gain over zero-shot baselines, while the Llama 3 8B multi-agent setup yields a +4.41% improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Bielik 11B v3, a state-of-the-art language model highly optimized for the Polish language, while also maintaining strong capabilities in other European languages. This model extends the Mistral 7B v0.2 architecture, scaled to 11B parameters via depth up-scaling. Its development involved a comprehensive four-stage training pipeline: continuous pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and reinforcement learning.
  Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Bielik 11B v3 achieves exceptional performance. It significantly surpasses other specialized Polish language models and outperforms many larger models (with 2-6 times more parameters) on a wide range of tasks, from basic linguistic understanding to complex reasoning.
  The model's parameter efficiency, combined with extensive quantization options, allows for effective deployment across diverse hardware configurations. Bielik 11B v3 not only advances AI capabilities for the Polish language but also establishes a new benchmark for developing resource-efficient, high-performance models for less-represented languages.</description>

      <title>Speculative Decoding: Performance or Illusion?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has become a popular technique to accelerate Large Language Model (LLM) inference, yet its real-world effectiveness remains unclear as prior evaluations rely on research prototypes and unrealistically small batch sizes. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic study of SD on a production-grade and widely deployed inference engine (vLLM), covering multiple SD variants ($n$-gram, EAGLE/EAGLE-3, Draft-Model, Multi-Token Prediction) across diverse workloads, model scales, and batch sizes. We analyze key factors governing SD performance, and quantify a theoretical upper bound on SD speedup. Our results show that verification by the target model dominates the execution, while acceptance length varies markedly across output token positions, requests, and datasets. Comparing measured performance with theoretical bounds reveals substantial gaps between observed and theoretical upper bounds, and we leverage this observation to highlight new research opportunities that our study opens up in improving SD.</description>

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) models have advanced significantly in machine reading comprehension but often exhibit biases that hinder their performance, particularly with complex queries in adversarial conditions. This study evaluates the ELECTRA-small model on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) v1.1 and adversarial datasets AddSent and AddOneSent. By identifying errors related to lexical bias, numerical reasoning, and entity recognition, we develop a multi-domain debiasing framework incorporating knowledge distillation, debiasing techniques, and domain expansion. Our results demonstrate up to 2.6 percentage point improvements in Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores across all test sets, with gains in adversarial contexts. These findings highlight the potential of targeted bias mitigation strategies to enhance the robustness and reliability of natural language understanding systems.</description>

      <title>Overview of the SciHigh Track at FIRE 2025: Research Highlight Generation from Scientific Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: `SciHigh: Research Highlight Generation from Scientific Papers' focuses on the task of automatically generating concise, informative, and meaningful bullet-point highlights directly from scientific abstracts. The goal of this task is to evaluate how effectively computational models can generate highlights that capture the key contributions, findings, and novelty of a paper in a concise form. Highlights help readers grasp essential ideas quickly and are often easier to read and understand than longer paragraphs, especially on mobile devices. The track uses the MixSub dataset \cite{10172215}, which provides pairs of abstracts and corresponding author-written highlights.
  In this inaugural edition of the track, 12 teams participated, exploring various approaches, including pre-trained language models, to generate highlights from this scientific dataset. All submissions were evaluated using established metrics such as ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore to measure both alignment with author-written highlights and overall informativeness. Teams were ranked based on ROUGE-L scores. The findings suggest that automatically generated highlights can reduce reading effort, accelerate literature reviews, and enhance metadata for digital libraries and academic search platforms. SciHigh provides a dedicated benchmark for advancing methods aimed at concise and accurate highlight generation from scientific writing.</description>

      <title>Bit-politeia: An AI Agent Community in Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current resource allocation paradigms, particularly in academic evaluation, are constrained by inherent limitations such as the Matthew Effect, reward hacking driven by Goodhart's Law, and the trade-off between efficiency and fairness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes "Bit-politeia", an AI agent community on blockchain designed to construct a fair, efficient, and sustainable resource allocation system. In this virtual community, residents interact via AI agents serving as their exclusive proxies, which are optimized for impartiality and value alignment. The community adopts a "clustered grouping + hierarchical architecture" that integrates democratic centralism to balance decision-making efficiency and trust mechanisms. Agents engage through casual chat and deliberative interactions to evaluate research outputs and distribute a virtual currency as rewards. This incentive mechanism aims to achieve incentive compatibility through consensus-driven evaluation, while blockchain technology ensures immutable records of all transactions and reputation data. By leveraging AI for objective assessment and decentralized verification, Bit-politeia minimizes human bias and mitigates resource centralization issues found in traditional peer review. The proposed framework provides a novel pathway for optimizing scientific innovation through a fair and automated resource configuration process.</description>

      <title>Let Me Try Again: Examining Replay Behavior by Tracing Students' Latent Problem-Solving Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior research has shown that students' problem-solving pathways in game-based learning environments reflect their conceptual understanding, procedural knowledge, and flexibility. Replay behaviors, in particular, may indicate productive struggle or broader exploration, which in turn foster deeper learning. However, little is known about how these pathways unfold sequentially across problems or how the timing of replays and other problem-solving strategies relates to proximal and distal learning outcomes. This study addresses these gaps using Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on log data from 777 seventh graders playing the game-based learning platform of From Here to There!. Results show that within problem sequences, students often persisted in states or engaged in immediate replay after successful completions, while across problems, strong self-transitions indicated stable strategic pathways. Four latent states emerged from HMMs: Incomplete-dominant, Optimal-ending, Replay, and Mixed. Regression analyses revealed that engagement in replay-dominant and optimal-ending states predicted higher conceptual knowledge, flexibility, and performance compared with the Incomplete-dominant state. Immediate replay consistently supported learning outcomes, whereas delayed replay was weakly or negatively associated in relation to Non-Replay. These findings suggest that replay in digital learning is not uniformly beneficial but depends on timing, with immediate replay supporting flexibility and more productive exploration.</description>

      <title>PLA-Serve: A Prefill-Length-Aware LLM Serving System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PLA-Serve identifies and disaggregates requests with different prompt lengths in LLM serving to reduce TTFT latency. While recent systems have decoupled the prefill and decode stages to improve throughput, they still rely on unified scheduling policies that fail to adapt to heterogeneous workload characteristics. We observe that prompt-length variations lead to distinct performance bottlenecks, motivating an adaptive scheduling strategy. PLA-Serve disaggregates multi-turn long-prefill requests from short-prefill ones and introduces a length-aware smart batching mechanism for short-prefill workloads. It adopts a dual-queue design that supports temporal disaggregation on a single prefill instance or spatial disaggregation across multiple instances. For short-prefill batches, a batch waiting window and CUDA Graph-based clustering mitigate interference from heterogeneous computation, reducing batching delay and lowering average latency. In real multi-turn workloads, PLA-Serve reduces prefill latency by over 30% compared to vanilla SGLang under prefill**--**decode disaggregation, and further decreases SLO violations by 28% in multi-instance deployments with vanilla data-parallel configuration. Compared to the SGLang router with load balancing, it further lowers SLO violations by 12% in multi-GPU settings. Under high concurrency and mixed-request scenarios, PLA-Serve improves request throughput by 35% serving Qwen2.5-32B model for prefill instance, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing heterogeneous LLM serving workloads.</description>

      <title>EPD-Serve: A Flexible Multimodal EPD Disaggregation Inference Serving System On Ascend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large multimodal models, efficient inference across text, image, audio, and video modalities has become critical. However, existing multimodal inference systems typically employ monolithic architectures that tightly couple the Encode, Prefill, and Decode stages on homogeneous hardware, neglecting the heterogeneous computational characteristics of each stage. This design leads to inefficient resource utilization and limited system throughput. To address these issues, we propose EPD-Serve, a stage-level disaggregated inference serving system for multimodal models. EPD-Serve decouples the inference pipeline into independent Encode, Prefill, and Decode stages, enabling logical isolation and flexible co-located deployment through dynamic orchestration. Leveraging the Ascend interconnect topology, EPD-Serve introduces asynchronous feature prefetching between Encode and Prefill stages and a hierarchical grouped KV cache transmission mechanism between Prefill and Decode stages to improve cross-node communication efficiency. In addition, EPD-Serve incorporates multi-route scheduling, instance-level load balancing, and multi-stage hardware co-location with spatial multiplexing to better support diverse multimodal workloads. Comprehensive experiments on multimodal understanding models demonstrate that, under high-concurrency scenarios, EPD-Serve improves end-to-end throughput by 57.37-69.48% compared to PD-disaggregated deployment, while satisfying strict SLO constraints, including TTFT below 2000 ms and TPOT below 50 ms. These results highlight the effectiveness of stage-level disaggregation for optimizing multimodal large model inference systems.</description>

      <title>Toward Youth-Centered Privacy-by-Design in Smart Devices: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This literature review evaluates privacy-by-design frameworks, tools, and policies intended to protect youth in AI-enabled smart devices using a PRISMA-guided workflow. Sources from major academic and grey-literature repositories from the past decade were screened. The search identified 2,216 records; after deduplication and screening, 645 articles underwent eligibility assessment, and 122 were included for analysis. The corpus was organized along three thematic categories: technical solutions, policy/regulatory measures, and education/awareness strategies. Findings reveal that while technical interventions such as on-device processing, federated learning, and lightweight encryption significantly reduce data exposure, their adoption remains limited. Policy frameworks, including the EU's GDPR, the UK Age-Appropriate Design Code, and Canada's PIPEDA, provide important baselines but are hindered by gaps in enforcement and age-appropriate design obligations, while educational initiatives are rarely integrated systematically into curricula. Overall, the corpus skews toward technical solutions (67%) relative to policy (21%) and education (12%), indicating an implementation gap outside the technical domain. To address these challenges, we recommend a multi-stakeholder model in which policymakers, manufacturers, and educators co-develop inclusive, transparent, and context-sensitive privacy ecosystems. This work advances discourse on youth data protection by offering empirically grounded insights and actionable recommendations for the design of ethical, privacy-preserving AI systems tailored to young users.</description>

      <title>Hindsight Preference Replay Improves Preference-Conditioned Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) enables agents to optimize vector-valued rewards while respecting user preferences. CAPQL, a preference-conditioned actor-critic method, achieves this by conditioning on weight vectors w and restricts data usage to the specific preferences under which it was collected, leaving off-policy data from other preferences unused. We introduce Hindsight Preference Replay (HPR), a simple and general replay augmentation strategy that retroactively relabels stored transitions with alternative preferences. This densifies supervision across the preference simplex without altering the CAPQL architecture or loss functions. Evaluated on six MO-Gymnasium locomotion tasks at a fixed 300000-step budget using expected utility (EUM), hypervolume (HV), and sparsity, HPR-CAPQL improves HV in five of six environments and EUM in four of six. On mo-humanoid-v5, for instance, EUM rises from $323\!\pm\!125$ to $1613\!\pm\!464$ and HV from 0.52M to 9.63M, with strong statistical support. mo-halfcheetah-v5 remains a challenging exception where CAPQL attains higher HV at comparable EUM. We report final summaries and Pareto-front visualizations across all tasks.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Aware Reformulation of Convolutions for Efficient Execution on Specialized AI Hardware: A Case Study on NVIDIA Tensor Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are central to modern AI, but their performance is often limited by hardware constraints. NVIDIA Tensor Cores, for instance, require input channels to be multiples of 8 and sometimes 512 for efficient execution. {\em oneDNN} framework for CPU imposes such a requirement for the blocked format. Traditional approaches address such alignment issue using zero-padding, which can be inefficient. In this work, we present a first-step, hardware-aware reformulation of CNN computations using rewrite rules, restructuring the underlying math to satisfy hardware alignment entirely {\bf post-training} without modifying network weights. While our current implementation focuses on a single transformation for Tensor Cores, this approach is generalizable, laying the foundation to explore additional transformations for CPU and accelerators. This study represents an initial step toward {\em semantic tuning}, a systematic, hardware-aware optimization strategy for efficient deployment of CNN models on specialized AI hardware.</description>

      <title>Multifaceted Scenario-Aware Hypergraph Learning for Next POI Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the diverse services provided by Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation plays a crucial role in inferring user preferences from historical check-in trajectories. However, existing sequential and graph-based methods frequently neglect significant mobility variations across distinct contextual scenarios (e.g., tourists versus locals). This oversight results in suboptimal performance due to two fundamental limitations: the inability to capture scenario-specific features and the failure to resolve inherent inter-scenario conflicts. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Multifaceted Scenario-Aware Hypergraph Learning method (MSAHG), a framework that adopts a scenario-splitting paradigm for next POI recommendation.
  Our main contributions are:
  (1) Construction of scenario-specific, multi-view disentangled sub-hypergraphs to capture distinct mobility patterns;
  (2) A parameter-splitting mechanism to adaptively resolve conflicting optimization directions across scenarios while preserving generalization capability.
  Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MSAHG consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenarios, confirming its effectiveness in multi-scenario POI recommendation.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Experts as Soft Clustering: A Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are commonly motivated by efficiency and conditional computation, but their effect on the geometry of learned functions and representations remains poorly characterized. In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance.</description>

      <title>Geometric Attention: A Regime-Explicit Operator Semantics for Transformer Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric Attention (GA) specifies an attention layer by four independent inputs: a finite carrier (what indices are addressable), an evidence-kernel rule (how masked proto-scores and a link induce nonnegative weights), a probe family (which observables are treated as admissible), and an anchor/update rule (which representative kernel is selected and how it is applied). Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime. Fixing the carrier and extensionalizing the update yields the standard fixed-token Transformer attention operator; allowing carrier updates yields adaptive-carrier and staged-depth regimes. The operator language also supports multihead/mixed kernels, plan-based anchors (e.g., entropic OT/Sinkhorn), and unary operators (e.g., FFN-style fields) as explicit regime choices. This separates invariant structure from modeling choice, enabling principled comparison and extension of attention mechanisms, and attention-based architectures.</description>

      <title>NoiseFormer -- Noise Diffused Symmetric Attention Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer architecture has been very successful long runner in the field of Deep Learning (DL) and Large Language Models (LLM) because of its powerful attention-based learning and parallel-natured architecture. As the models grow gigantic in terms of memory footprint, difficulties in fitting the model on a device like a GPU or an AI accelerator give rise to the need for multiple computing devices thereby escalating the computing cost. This increased training/inference cost paved the way for efficient model size reduction/parametric reduction deploying Sparse Attention techniques. In this paper, we start analyzing one of the techniques of Sparse Attention called Symmetric Dot-Product Attention (referred to as Symmetric Attention) and propose a novel unified model architecture called Noise Diffused Symmetric Attention Transformer to enhance the model's performance. While maintaining the memory gains of Symmetric Attention, with minute overhead in terms of model parameters and computational overhead, the proposed model brings in enhanced performance in terms of accuracy and inference-time sampling. The proposed model is validated upon GPT2 base model and the results reflect the performance gains falling between plain Symmetric attention and GPT2 base model on a variety of GLUE benchmark tasks in terms of accuracy, with significant model size reduction with respect to the base model.</description>

      <title>Syllabic Agglutinative Tokenizations for Indonesian LLM: A Study from Gasing Literacy Learning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel syllable-based tokenization approach for Indonesian large language models, inspired by the Gasing Literacy Learning System's pedagogical methodology. Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we develop a tokenization framework that segments Indonesian text at syllable boundaries before applying byte-pair encoding, creating a vocabulary that aligns with the language's morphophonological structure. Our approach first identifies high-frequency syllables through rule-based segmentation, then constructs a compact vocabulary of 3,500 tokens that preserves meaningful linguistic units while maintaining coverage through character-level fallback. Empirical evaluation on Indonesian Wikipedia and folklore corpora from Indonesian Culture Digital Library (PDBI) demonstrates substantial improvements over conventional tokenization methods: the syllable-based approach achieves R\'enyi efficiency of 0.74 compared to 0.50-0.64 for pretrained multilingual tokenizers, while maintaining higher average token lengths (3.67 characters versus 2.72 for GPT-2) despite using a vocabulary an order of magnitude smaller. These gains emerge from the method's ability to internalize character-level dependencies within syllable units, reducing the computational burden on language models while respecting Indonesian's agglutinative morphology. We call the LLM built upon this principle, TOBA LLM (Tokenisasi Optimum Berbasis Aglutinasi), the convergence of human literacy pedagogy with computational optimization principles offers a promising paradigm for developing linguistically-informed tokenization strategies, particularly for morphologically rich and underrepresented languages in natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Predicting When to Trust Vision-Language Models for Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across multimodal tasks, yet exhibit systematic spatial reasoning failures, achieving only 49% (CLIP) to 54% (BLIP-2) accuracy on basic directional relationships. For safe deployment in robotics and autonomous systems, we need to predict when to trust VLM spatial predictions rather than accepting all outputs. We propose a vision-based confidence estimation framework that validates VLM predictions through independent geometric verification using object detection. Unlike text-based approaches relying on self-assessment, our method fuses four signals via gradient boosting: geometric alignment between VLM claims and coordinates, spatial ambiguity from overlap, detection quality, and VLM internal uncertainty. We achieve 0.674 AUROC on BLIP-2 (34.0% improvement over text-based baselines) and 0.583 AUROC on CLIP (16.1% improvement), generalizing across generative and classification architectures. Our framework enables selective prediction: at 60% target accuracy, we achieve 61.9% coverage versus 27.6% baseline (2.2x improvement) on BLIP-2. Feature analysis reveals vision-based signals contribute 87.4% of model importance versus 12.7% from VLM confidence, validating that external geometric verification outperforms self-assessment. We demonstrate reliable scene graph construction where confidence-based pruning improves precision from 52.1% to 78.3% while retaining 68.2% of edges.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Workflow Optimization in CI/CD Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are central to modern software delivery, yet their static workflows often introduce inefficiencies as systems scale. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to dynamically optimize CI/CD pipeline workflows. The pipeline is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, and an RL agent is trained to make runtime decisions such as selecting full, partial, or no test execution in order to maximize throughput while minimizing testing overhead.
  A configurable CI/CD simulation environment is developed to evaluate the approach across build, test, and deploy stages. Experimental results show that the RL optimized pipeline achieves up to a 30 percent improvement in throughput and approximately a 25 percent reduction in test execution time compared to static baselines, while maintaining a defect miss rate below 5 percent. The agent learns to selectively skip or abbreviate tests for low risk commits, accelerating feedback cycles without significantly increasing failure risk.
  These results demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning to enable adaptive and intelligent DevOps workflows, providing a practical pathway toward more efficient, resilient, and sustainable CI/CD automation.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agent for User-friendly Chemical Process Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern process simulators enable detailed process design, simulation, and optimization; however, constructing and interpreting simulations is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This limits early exploration by inexperienced users. To address this, a large language model (LLM) agent is integrated with AVEVA Process Simulation (APS) via Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing natural language interaction with rigorous process simulations. An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions. Two water-methanol separation case studies assess the framework across different task complexities and interaction modes. The first shows the agent autonomously analyzing flowsheets, finding improvement opportunities, and iteratively optimizing, extracting data, and presenting results clearly. The framework benefits both educational purposes, by translating technical concepts and demonstrating workflows, and experienced practitioners by automating data extraction, speeding routine tasks, and supporting brainstorming. The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement. While current limitations such as oversimplification, calculation errors, and technical hiccups mean expert oversight is still needed, the framework's capabilities in analysis, optimization, and guided construction suggest LLM-based agents can become valuable collaborators.</description>

      <title>Aesthetics as Structural Harm: Algorithmic Lookism Across Text-to-Image Generation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines algorithmic lookism-the systematic preferential treatment based on physical appearance-in text-to-image (T2I) generative AI and a downstream gender classification task. Through the analysis of 26,400 synthetic faces created with Stable Diffusion 2.1 and 3.5 Medium, we demonstrate how generative AI models systematically associate facial attractiveness with positive attributes and vice-versa, mirroring socially constructed biases rather than evidence-based correlations. Furthermore, we find significant gender bias in three gender classification algorithms depending on the attributes of the input faces. Our findings reveal three critical harms: (1) the systematic encoding of attractiveness-positive attribute associations in T2I models; (2) gender disparities in classification systems, where women's faces, particularly those generated with negative attributes, suffer substantially higher misclassification rates than men's; and (3) intensifying aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, gendered exposure patterns, and geographic reductionism. These convergent patterns reveal algorithmic lookism as systematic infrastructure operating across AI vision systems, compounding existing inequalities through both representation and recognition.
  Disclaimer: This work includes visual and textual content that reflects stereotypical associations between physical appearance and socially constructed attributes, including gender, race, and traits associated with social desirability. Any such associations found in this study emerge from the biases embedded in generative AI systems-not from empirical truths or the authors' views.</description>

      <title>WISP: Waste- and Interference-Suppressed Distributed Speculative LLM Serving at the Edge via Dynamic Drafting and SLO-Aware Batching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly accessible to end users, an ever-growing number of inference requests are initiated from edge devices and computed on centralized GPU clusters. However, the resulting exponential growth in computation workload is placing significant strain on data centers, while edge devices remain largely underutilized, leading to imbalanced workloads and resource inefficiency across the network. Integrating edge devices into the LLM inference process via speculative decoding helps balance the workload between the edge and the cloud, while maintaining lossless prediction accuracy. In this paper, we identify and formalize two critical bottlenecks that limit the efficiency and scalability of distributed speculative LLM serving: Wasted Drafting Time and Verification Interference. To address these challenges, we propose WISP, an efficient and SLO-aware distributed LLM inference system that consists of an intelligent speculation controller, a verification time estimator, and a verification batch scheduler. These components collaboratively enhance drafting efficiency and optimize verification request scheduling on the server. Extensive numerical results show that WISP improves system capacity by up to 2.1x and 4.1x, and increases system goodput by up to 1.94x and 3.7x, compared to centralized serving and SLED, respectively.</description>

      <title>Size is Not the Solution: Deformable Convolutions for Effective Physics Aware Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) enables rapid prediction of complex physical systems, yet current convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures struggle with highly nonlinear flows. While scaling model size addresses complexity in broader AI, this approach yields diminishing returns for physics modeling. Drawing inspiration from Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian (HLE) numerical methods, we introduce deformable physics-aware recurrent convolutions (D-PARC) to overcome the rigidity of CNNs. Across Burgers' equation, Navier-Stokes, and reactive flows, D-PARC achieves superior fidelity compared to substantially larger architectures. Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned "active filtration" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics. This demonstrates that physically intuitive architectural design can outperform parameter scaling, establishing that strategic learning in lean networks offers a more effective path forward for PADL than indiscriminate network expansion.</description>

      <title>Towards AGI A Pragmatic Approach Towards Self Evolving Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents are powerful yet fundamentally static after deployment, lacking the ability to autonomously expand capabilities, generate new tools, or evolve their reasoning. This work introduces a hierarchical self-evolving multi-agent framework that integrates a Base LLM, an operational SLM agent, a Code-Generation LLM, and a Teacher-LLM to enable continuous adaptation. The workflow begins with the agent attempting a task using reasoning and existing tools; if unsuccessful, it escalates to tool synthesis through the Code-Gen LLM, and when failures persist, it triggers an evolution phase using Curriculum Learning (CL), Reward-Based Learning (RL), or Genetic Algorithm (GA) evolution. Using the TaskCraft dataset rich in hierarchical tasks, tool-use traces, and difficulty scaling we evaluate these paradigms. CL delivers fast recovery and strong generalization, RL excels on high-difficulty tasks, and GA offers high behavioral diversity. Across all settings, evolved agents outperform their originals, demonstrating robust, autonomous, self-improving agentic evolution.</description>

      <title>Activation Sensitivity as a Unifying Principle for Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) methods for large language models rely on heuristics that implicitly estimate which weight channels most strongly influence model behavior. Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon. Rather than proposing a new quantization algorithm, this work provides a conceptual foundation for understanding and comparing post-training quantization methods through the lens of sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Serverless AI Security: Attack Surface Analysis and Runtime Protection Mechanisms for FaaS-Based Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serverless computing has achieved widespread adoption, with over 70% of AWS organizations using serverless solutions [1]. Meanwhile, machine learning inference workloads increasingly migrate to Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms for their scalability and cost-efficiency [2], [3], [4]. However, this convergence introduces critical security challenges, with recent reports showing a 220% increase in AI/ML vulnerabilities [5] and serverless computing's fragmented architecture raises new security concerns distinct from traditional cloud deployments [6], [7]. This paper presents the first comprehensive security analysis of machine learning workloads in serverless environments. We systematically characterize the attack surface across five categories: function-level vulnerabilities (cold start exploitation, dependency poisoning), model-specific threats (API-based extraction, adversarial inputs), infrastructure attacks (cross-function contamination, privilege escalation), supply chain risks (malicious layers, backdoored libraries), and IAM complexity (ephemeral nature, serverless functions). Through empirical assessments across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, we demonstrate real-world attack scenarios and quantify their security impact. We propose Serverless AI Shield (SAS), a multi-layered defense framework providing pre-deployment validation, runtime monitoring, and post-execution forensics. Our evaluation shows SAS achieves 94% detection rates while maintaining performance overhead below 9% for inference latency. We release an open-source security toolkit to enable practitioners to assess and harden their serverless AI deployments, advancing the field toward more resilient cloud-native machine learning systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MATEX (Multi-scale Attention and Text-guided Explainability), a novel framework that advances interpretability in medical vision-language models by incorporating anatomically informed spatial reasoning. MATEX synergistically combines multi-layer attention rollout, text-guided spatial priors, and layer consistency analysis to produce precise, stable, and clinically meaningful gradient attribution maps. By addressing key limitations of prior methods, such as spatial imprecision, lack of anatomical grounding, and limited attention granularity, MATEX enables more faithful and interpretable model explanations. Evaluated on the MS-CXR dataset, MATEX outperforms the state-of-the-art M2IB approach in both spatial precision and alignment with expert-annotated findings. These results highlight MATEX's potential to enhance trust and transparency in radiological AI applications.</description>

      <title>Distill-then-Replace: Efficient Task-Specific Hybrid Attention Model Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer architectures deliver state-of-the-art accuracy via dense full-attention, but their quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to sequence length limits practical deployment. Linear attention mechanisms offer linear or near-linear scaling yet often incur performance degradation. Hybrid models that integrate full and linear attention layers promise a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but face two major challenges: training such hybrid models from scratch is computationally expensive, and manually designing the optimal placement of attention types is highly nontrivial. We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>A Confidence-Variance Theory for Pseudo-Label Selection in Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most pseudo-label selection strategies in semi-supervised learning rely on fixed confidence thresholds, implicitly assuming that prediction confidence reliably indicates correctness. In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

      <title>Pigment Network Detection and Classification in Dermoscopic Images Using Directional Imaging Algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of melanoma, which can save thousands of lives, relies heavily on the analysis of dermoscopic images. One crucial diagnostic criterion is the identification of unusual pigment network (PN). However, distinguishing between regular (typical) and irregular (atypical) PN is challenging. This study aims to automate the PN detection process using a directional imaging algorithm and classify PN types using machine learning classifiers. The directional imaging algorithm incorporates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), contrast enhancement, filtering, and noise reduction. Applied to the PH2 dataset, this algorithm achieved a 96% success rate, which increased to 100% after pixel intensity adjustments. We created a new dataset containing only PN images from these results. We then employed two classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bag of Features (BoF), to categorize PN into atypical and typical classes. Given the limited dataset of 200 images, a simple and effective CNN was designed, featuring two convolutional layers and two batch normalization layers. The proposed CNN achieved 90% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 89% specificity. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, our CNN demonstrated superior performance. Our study highlights the potential of the proposed CNN model for effective PN classification, suggesting future research should focus on expanding datasets and incorporating additional dermatological features to further enhance melanoma diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Generating metamers of human scene understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human vision combines low-resolution "gist" information from the visual periphery with sparse but high-resolution information from fixated locations to construct a coherent understanding of a visual scene. In this paper, we introduce MetamerGen, a tool for generating scenes that are aligned with latent human scene representations. MetamerGen is a latent diffusion model that combines peripherally obtained scene gist information with information obtained from scene-viewing fixations to generate image metamers for what humans understand after viewing a scene. Generating images from both high and low resolution (i.e. "foveated") inputs constitutes a novel image-to-image synthesis problem, which we tackle by introducing a dual-stream representation of the foveated scenes consisting of DINOv2 tokens that fuse detailed features from fixated areas with peripherally degraded features capturing scene context. To evaluate the perceptual alignment of MetamerGen generated images to latent human scene representations, we conducted a same-different behavioral experiment where participants were asked for a "same" or "different" response between the generated and the original image. With that, we identify scene generations that are indeed metamers for the latent scene representations formed by the viewers. MetamerGen is a powerful tool for understanding scene understanding. Our proof-of-concept analyses uncovered specific features at multiple levels of visual processing that contributed to human judgments. While it can generate metamers even conditioned on random fixations, we find that high-level semantic alignment most strongly predicts metamerism when the generated scenes are conditioned on viewers' own fixated regions.</description>

      <title>HALO: Semantic-Aware Distributed LLM Inference in Lossy Edge Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models' (LLMs) inference at the edge can facilitate prompt service responsiveness while protecting user privacy. However, it is critically challenged by the resource constraints of a single edge node. Distributed inference has emerged to aggregate and leverage computational resources across multiple devices. Yet, existing methods typically require strict synchronization, which is often infeasible due to the unreliable network conditions. In this paper, we propose HALO, a novel framework that can boost the distributed LLM inference in lossy edge network. The core idea is to enable a relaxed yet effective synchronization by strategically allocating less critical neuron groups to unstable devices, thus avoiding the excessive waiting time incurred by delayed packets. HALO introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a semantic-aware predictor to assess the significance of neuron groups prior to activation. (2) a parallel execution scheme of neuron group loading during the model inference. (3) a load-balancing scheduler that efficiently orchestrates multiple devices with heterogeneous resources. Experimental results from a Raspberry Pi cluster demonstrate that HALO achieves a 3.41x end-to-end speedup for LLaMA-series LLMs under unreliable network conditions. It maintains performance comparable to optimal conditions and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Attesting Model Lineage by Consisted Knowledge Evolution with Fine-Tuning Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fine-tuning technique in deep learning gives rise to an emerging lineage relationship among models. This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of our approach in a variety of adversarial scenarios in the real world. Our method consistently achieves reliable lineage verification across a broad spectrum of model types, including classifiers, diffusion models, and large language models.</description>

      <title>Mobile-friendly Image de-noising: Hardware Conscious Optimization for Edge Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image enhancement is a critical task in computer vision and photography that is often entangled with noise. This renders the traditional Image Signal Processing (ISP) ineffective compared to the advances in deep learning. However, the success of such methods is increasingly associated with the ease of their deployment on edge devices, such as smartphones. This work presents a novel mobile-friendly network for image de-noising obtained with Entropy-Regularized differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) on a hardware-aware search space for a U-Net architecture, which is first-of-its-kind. The designed model has 12% less parameters, with ~2-fold improvement in ondevice latency and 1.5-fold improvement in the memory footprint for a 0.7% drop in PSNR, when deployed and profiled on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Compared to the SOTA Swin-Transformer for Image Restoration, the proposed network had competitive accuracy with ~18-fold reduction in GMACs. Further, the network was tested successfully for Gaussian de-noising with 3 intensities on 4 benchmarks and real-world de-noising on 1 benchmark demonstrating its generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Image Deblurring for Edge Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image deblurring is a critical stage in mobile image signal processing pipelines, where the ability to restore fine structures and textures must be balanced with real-time constraints on edge devices. While recent deep networks such as transformers and activation-free architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy, their efficiency is typically measured in FLOPs or parameters, which do not correlate with latency on embedded hardware. We propose a hardware-aware adaptation framework that restructures existing models through sensitivity-guided block substitution, surrogate distillation, and training-free multi-objective search driven by device profiling. Applied to the 36-block NAFNet baseline, the optimized variants achieve up to 55% reduction in GMACs compared to the recent transformer-based SOTA while maintaining competitive accuracy. Most importantly, on-device deployment yields a 1.25X latency improvement over the baseline. Experiments on motion deblurring (GoPro), defocus deblurring (DPDD), and auxiliary benchmarks (RealBlur-J/R, HIDE) demonstrate the generality of the approach, while comparisons with prior efficient baselines confirm its accuracy-efficiency trade-off. These results establish feedback-driven adaptation as a principled strategy for bridging the gap between algorithmic design and deployment-ready deblurring models.</description>

      <title>Proof of Concept: Multi-Target Wildfire Risk Prediction and Large Language Model Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art approaches to wildfire risk assessment often overlook operational needs, limiting their practical value for first responders and firefighting services. Effective wildfire management requires a multi-target analysis that captures the diverse dimensions of wildfire risk, including meteorological danger, ignition activity, intervention complexity, and resource mobilization, rather than relying on a single predictive indicator. In this proof of concept, we propose the development of a hybrid framework that combines predictive models for each risk dimension with large language models (LLMs) to synthesize heterogeneous outputs into structured, actionable reports.</description>

      <title>Semantic Caching and Intent-Driven Context Optimization for Multi-Agent Natural Language to Code Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a production-optimized multi-agent system designed to translate natural language queries into executable Python code for structured data analytics. Unlike systems that rely on expensive frontier models, our approach achieves high accuracy and cost efficiency through three key innovations: (1) a semantic caching system with LLM-based equivalence detection and structured adaptation hints that provides cache hit rates of 67% on production queries; (2) a dual-threshold decision mechanism that separates exact-match retrieval from reference-guided generation; and (3) an intent-driven dynamic prompt assembly system that reduces token consumption by 40-60% through table-aware context filtering. The system has been deployed in production for enterprise inventory management, processing over 10,000 queries with an average latency of 8.2 seconds and 94.3% semantic accuracy. We describe the architecture, present empirical results from production deployment, and discuss practical considerations for deploying LLM-based analytics systems at scale.</description>

      <title>SpecMap: Hierarchical LLM Agent for Datasheet-to-Code Traceability Link Recovery in Systems Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing precise traceability between embedded systems datasheets and their corresponding code implementations remains a fundamental challenge in systems engineering, particularly for low-level software where manual mapping between specification documents and large code repositories is infeasible. Existing Traceability Link Recovery approaches primarily rely on lexical similarity and information retrieval techniques, which struggle to capture the semantic, structural, and symbol level relationships prevalent in embedded systems software. We present a hierarchical datasheet-to-code mapping methodology that employs large language models for semantic analysis while explicitly structuring the traceability process across multiple abstraction levels. Rather than performing direct specification-to-code matching, the proposed approach progressively narrows the search space through repository-level structure inference, file-level relevance estimation, and fine-grained symbollevel alignment. The method extends beyond function-centric mapping by explicitly covering macros, structs, constants, configuration parameters, and register definitions commonly found in systems-level C/C++ codebases. We evaluate the approach on multiple open-source embedded systems repositories using manually curated datasheet-to-code ground truth. Experimental results show substantial improvements over traditional information-retrieval-based baselines, achieving up to 73.3% file mapping accuracy. We significantly reduce computational overhead, lowering total LLM token consumption by 84% and end-to-end runtime by approximately 80%. This methodology supports automated analysis of large embedded software systems and enables downstream applications such as training data generation for systems-aware machine learning models, standards compliance verification, and large-scale specification coverage analysis.</description>

      <title>Telling Human and Machine Handwriting Apart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handwriting movements can be leveraged as a unique form of behavioral biometrics, to verify whether a real user is operating a device or application. This task can be framed as a reverse Turing test in which a computer has to detect if an input instance has been generated by a human or artificially. To tackle this task, we study ten public datasets of handwritten symbols (isolated characters, digits, gestures, pointing traces, and signatures) that are artificially reproduced using seven different synthesizers, including, among others, the Kinematic Theory (Sigma h model), generative adversarial networks, Transformers, and Diffusion models. We train a shallow recurrent neural network that achieves excellent performance (98.3 percent Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score and 1.4 percent equal error rate on average across all synthesizers and datasets) using nonfeaturized trajectory data as input. In few-shot settings, we show that our classifier achieves such an excellent performance when trained on just 10 percent of the data, as evaluated on the remaining 90% of the data as a test set. We further challenge our classifier in out-of-domain settings, and observe very competitive results as well. Our work has implications for computerized systems that need to verify human presence, and adds an additional layer of security to keep attackers at bay.</description>

      <title>PASTA: A Scalable Framework for Multi-Policy AI Compliance Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI compliance is becoming increasingly critical as AI systems grow more powerful and pervasive. Yet the rapid expansion of AI policies creates substantial burdens for resource-constrained practitioners lacking policy expertise. Existing approaches typically address one policy at a time, making multi-policy compliance costly. We present PASTA, a scalable compliance tool integrating four innovations: (1) a comprehensive model-card format supporting descriptive inputs across development stages; (2) a policy normalization scheme; (3) an efficient LLM-powered pairwise evaluation engine with cost-saving strategies; and (4) an interface delivering interpretable evaluations via compliance heatmaps and actionable recommendations. Expert evaluation shows PASTA's judgments closely align with human experts ($\rho \geq .626$). The system evaluates five major policies in under two minutes at approximately \$3. A user study (N = 12) confirms practitioners found outputs easy-to-understand and actionable, introducing a novel framework for scalable automated AI governance.</description>

      <title>Inter-Cell Interference Rejection Based on Ultrawideband Walsh-Domain Wireless Autoencoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel technique for rejecting partial-in-band inter-cell interference (ICI) in ultrawideband communication systems. We present the design of an end-to-end wireless autoencoder architecture that jointly optimizes the transmitter and receiver encoding/decoding in the Walsh domain to mitigate interference from coexisting narrower-band 5G base stations. By exploiting the orthogonality and self-inverse properties of Walsh functions, the system distributes and learns to encode bit-words across parallel Walsh branches. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we characterize how 5G CPOFDM interference maps into the Walsh domain and identify optimal ratios of transmission frequencies and sampling rate where the end-to-end autoencoder achieves the highest rejection. Experimental results show that the proposed autoencoder achieves up to 12 dB of ICI rejection while maintaining a low block error rate (BLER) for the same baseline channel noise, i.e., baseline Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) without the interference.</description>

      <title>LIME-LLM: Probing Models with Fluent Counterfactuals, Not Broken Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local explanation methods such as LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) remain fundamental to trustworthy AI, yet their application to NLP is limited by a reliance on random token masking. These heuristic perturbations frequently generate semantically invalid, out-of-distribution inputs that weaken the fidelity of local surrogate models. While recent generative approaches such as LLiMe (Angiulli et al., 2025b) attempt to mitigate this by employing Large Language Models for neighborhood generation, they rely on unconstrained paraphrasing that introduces confounding variables, making it difficult to isolate specific feature contributions. We introduce LIME-LLM, a framework that replaces random noise with hypothesis-driven, controlled perturbations. By enforcing a strict "Single Mask-Single Sample" protocol and employing distinct neutral infill and boundary infill strategies, LIME-LLM constructs fluent, on-manifold neighborhoods that rigorously isolate feature effects. We evaluate our method against established baselines (LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and the generative LLiMe baseline across three diverse benchmarks: CoLA, SST-2, and HateXplain using human-annotated rationales as ground truth. Empirical results demonstrate that LIME-LLM establishes a new benchmark for black-box NLP explainability, achieving significant improvements in local explanation fidelity compared to both traditional perturbation-based methods and recent generative alternatives.</description>

      <title>Early Linguistic Pattern of Anxiety from Social Media Using Interpretable Linguistic Features: A Multi-Faceted Validation Study with Author-Disjoint Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anxiety affects hundreds of millions of individuals globally, yet large-scale screening remains limited. Social media language provides an opportunity for scalable detection, but current models often lack interpretability, keyword-robustness validation, and rigorous user-level data integrity. This work presents a transparent approach to social media-based anxiety detection through linguistically interpretable feature-grounded modeling and cross-domain validation. Using a substantial dataset of Reddit posts, we trained a logistic regression classifier on carefully curated subreddits for training, validation, and test splits. Comprehensive evaluation included feature ablation, keyword masking experiments, and varying-density difference analyses comparing anxious and control groups, along with external validation using clinically interviewed participants with diagnosed anxiety disorders. The model achieved strong performance while maintaining high accuracy even after sentiment removal or keyword masking. Early detection using minimal post history significantly outperformed random classification, and cross-domain analysis demonstrated strong consistency with clinical interview data. Results indicate that transparent linguistic features can support reliable, generalizable, and keyword-robust anxiety detection. The proposed framework provides a reproducible baseline for interpretable mental health screening across diverse online contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topic modeling has extensive applications in text mining and data analysis across various industrial sectors. Although the concept of granularity holds significant value for business applications by providing deeper insights, the capability of topic modeling methods to produce granular topics has not been thoroughly explored. In this context, this paper introduces a framework called TIDE, which primarily provides a novel granular topic modeling method based on large language models (LLMs) as a core feature, along with other useful functionalities for business applications, such as summarizing long documents, topic parenting, and distillation. Through extensive experiments on a variety of public and real-world business datasets, we demonstrate that TIDE's topic modeling approach outperforms modern topic modeling methods, and our auxiliary components provide valuable support for dealing with industrial business scenarios. The TIDE framework is currently undergoing the process of being open sourced.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Self-Supervised Detection of Fundamental Frequency and Accurate Probability of Voicing in Monophonic Music</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable fundamental frequency (F 0) and voicing estimation is essential for neural synthesis, yet many pitch extractors depend on large labeled corpora and degrade under realistic recording artifacts. We propose a lightweight, fully self-supervised framework for joint F 0 estimation and voicing inference, designed for rapid single-instrument training from limited audio. Using transposition-equivariant learning on CQT features, we introduce an EM-style iterative reweighting scheme that uses Shift Cross-Entropy (SCE) consistency as a reliability signal to suppress uninformative noisy/unvoiced frames. The resulting weights provide confidence scores that enable pseudo-labeling for a separate lightweight voicing classifier without manual annotations. Trained on MedleyDB and evaluated on MDB-stem-synth ground truth, our method achieves competitive cross-corpus performance (RPA 95.84, RCA 96.24) and demonstrates cross-instrument generalization.</description>

      <title>Cleansing the Artificial Mind: A Self-Reflective Detoxification Framework for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed remarkable generative capabilities and emerging self-regulatory mechanisms, including self-correction and self-rewarding. However, current detoxification techniques rarely exploit these built-in abilities; instead, they rely on external modules, labor-intensive data annotation, or human intervention --factors that hinder scalability and consistency. In this paper, we introduce a fully self-reflective detoxification framework that harnesses the inherent capacities of LLMs to detect, correct toxic content, and refine LLMs without external modules and data annotation. Specifically, we propose a Toxic Signal Detector --an internal self-identification mechanism, coupled with a systematic intervention process to transform toxic text into its non-toxic counterpart. This iterative procedure yields a contrastive detoxification dataset used to fine-tune the model, enhancing its ability for safe and coherent text generation. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as DetoxLLM and ParaDetox show that our method achieves better detoxification performance than state-of-the-art methods while preserving semantic fidelity. By obviating the need for human intervention or external components, this paper reveals the intrinsic self-detoxification ability of LLMs, offering a consistent and effective approach for mitigating harmful content generation. Ultimately, our findings underscore the potential for truly self-regulated language models, paving the way for more responsible and ethically guided text generation systems.</description>

      <title>Translation as a Scalable Proxy for Multilingual Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of LLMs has created a critical evaluation paradox: while LLMs claim multilingual proficiency, comprehensive non-machine-translated benchmarks exist for fewer than 30 languages, leaving &gt;98% of the world's 7,000 languages in an empirical void. Traditional benchmark construction faces scaling challenges such as cost, scarcity of domain experts, and data contamination. We evaluate the validity of a simpler alternative: can translation quality alone indicate a model's broader multilingual capabilities? Through systematic evaluation of 14 models (1B-72B parameters) across 9 diverse benchmarks and 7 translation metrics, we find that translation performance is a good indicator of downstream task success (e.g., Phi-4, median Pearson r: MetricX = 0.89, xCOMET = 0.91, SSA-COMET = 0.87). These results suggest that the representational abilities supporting faithful translation overlap with those required for multilingual understanding. Translation quality, thus emerges as a strong, inexpensive first-pass proxy of multilingual performance, enabling a translation-first screening with targeted follow-up for specific tasks.</description>

      <title>RobotDesignGPT: Automated Robot Design Synthesis using Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot design is a nontrivial process that involves careful consideration of multiple criteria, including user specifications, kinematic structures, and visual appearance. Therefore, the design process often relies heavily on domain expertise and significant human effort. The majority of current methods are rule-based, requiring the specification of a grammar or a set of primitive components and modules that can be composed to create a design. We propose a novel automated robot design framework, RobotDesignGPT, that leverages the general knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large pre-trained vision-language models to automate the robot design synthesis process. Our framework synthesizes an initial robot design from a simple user prompt and a reference image. Our novel visual feedback approach allows us to greatly improve the design quality and reduce unnecessary manual feedback. We demonstrate that our framework can design visually appealing and kinematically valid robots inspired by nature, ranging from legged animals to flying creatures. We justify the proposed framework by conducting an ablation study and a user study.</description>

      <title>ATOD: An Evaluation Framework and Benchmark for Agentic Task-Oriented Dialogue System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, driven by large language models (LLMs) with extensive API and tool integration, have enabled conversational agents to coordinate interleaved goals, maintain long-horizon context, and act proactively through asynchronous execution. These capabilities extend beyond traditional TOD systems, yet existing benchmarks lack systematic support for evaluating such agentic behaviors. To address this gap, we introduce ATOD, a benchmark and synthetic dialogue generation pipeline that produces richly annotated conversations requiring long-term reasoning. ATOD captures key characteristics of advanced TOD, including multi-goal coordination, dependency management, memory, adaptability, and proactivity. Building on ATOD, we propose ATOD-Eval, a holistic evaluation framework that translates these dimensions into fine-grained metrics and supports reproducible offline and online evaluation. We further present a strong agentic memory-based evaluator for benchmarking on ATOD. Experiments show that ATOD-Eval enables comprehensive assessment across task completion, agentic capability, and response quality, and that the proposed evaluator offers a better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to existing memory- and LLM-based approaches under this evaluation setting.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Transformer for Robust and Scalable SLA Decomposition via Amortized Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks increasingly relies on network slicing to provide tailored, End-to-End (E2E) logical networks over shared physical infrastructures. A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Metadata for Better Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems depend on retrieving semantically relevant document chunks to support accurate, grounded outputs from large language models. In structured and repetitive corpora such as regulatory filings, chunk similarity alone often fails to distinguish between documents with overlapping language. Practitioners often flatten metadata into input text as a heuristic, but the impact and trade-offs of this practice remain poorly understood. We present a systematic study of metadata-aware retrieval strategies, comparing plain-text baselines with approaches that embed metadata directly. Our evaluation spans metadata-as-text (prefix and suffix), a dual-encoder unified embedding that fuses metadata and content in a single index, dual-encoder late-fusion retrieval, and metadata-aware query reformulation. Across multiple retrieval metrics and question types, we find that prefixing and unified embeddings consistently outperform plain-text baselines, with the unified at times exceeding prefixing while being easier to maintain. Beyond empirical comparisons, we analyze embedding space, showing that metadata integration improves effectiveness by increasing intra-document cohesion, reducing inter-document confusion, and widening the separation between relevant and irrelevant chunks. Field-level ablations show that structural cues provide strong disambiguating signals. Our code, evaluation framework, and the RAGMATE-10K dataset are publicly hosted.</description>

      <title>Terminal-Bench: Benchmarking Agents on Hard, Realistic Tasks in Command Line Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents may soon become capable of autonomously completing valuable, long-horizon tasks in diverse domains. Current benchmarks either do not measure real-world tasks, or are not sufficiently difficult to meaningfully measure frontier models. To this end, we present Terminal-Bench 2.0: a carefully curated hard benchmark composed of 89 tasks in computer terminal environments inspired by problems from real workflows. Each task features a unique environment, human-written solution, and comprehensive tests for verification. We show that frontier models and agents score less than 65\% on the benchmark and conduct an error analysis to identify areas for model and agent improvement. We publish the dataset and evaluation harness to assist developers and researchers in future work at https://www.tbench.ai/ .</description>

      <title>AI for Green Spaces: Leveraging Autonomous Navigation and Computer Vision for Park Litter Removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are 50 billion pieces of litter in the U.S. alone. Grass fields contribute to this problem because picnickers tend to leave trash on the field. We propose building a robot that can autonomously navigate, identify, and pick up trash in parks. To autonomously navigate the park, we used a Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) algorithm to generate a coverage path the robot could follow. To navigate this path, we successfully used Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS, which provides a centimeter-level reading every second. For computer vision, we utilized the ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which detects trash with 94.52% accuracy. For trash pickup, we tested multiple design concepts. We select a new pickup mechanism that specifically targets the trash we encounter on the field. Our solution achieved an overall success rate of 80%, demonstrating that autonomous trash pickup robots on grass fields are a viable solution.</description>

      <title>TF-CoDiT: Conditional Time Series Synthesis with Diffusion Transformers for Treasury Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have achieved milestones in synthesizing financial time-series data, such as stock prices and order flows. However, their performance in synthesizing treasury futures data is still underexplored. This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth. Further studies evidence the robustness of TF-CoDiT across contracts and temporal horizons.</description>

Abstract: DevBench is a telemetry-driven benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on realistic code completion tasks. It includes 1,800 evaluation instances across six programming languages and six task categories derived from real developer telemetry, such as API usage and code purpose understanding. Unlike prior benchmarks, it emphasizes ecological validity, avoids training data contamination, and enables detailed diagnostics. The evaluation combines functional correctness, similarity-based metrics, and LLM-judge assessments focused on usefulness and contextual relevance. 9 state-of-the-art models were assessed, revealing differences in syntactic precision, semantic reasoning, and practical utility. Our benchmark provides actionable insights to guide model selection and improvement-detail that is often missing from other benchmarks but is essential for both practical deployment and targeted model development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of airborne platforms, including commercial aircraft, drones, and UAVs, has intensified the need for real-time, automated threat assessment systems. Current approaches depend heavily on manual monitoring, resulting in limited scalability and operational inefficiencies. This work introduces a dual-task model based on EfficientNetB4 capable of performing airborne object classification and threat-level prediction simultaneously. To address the scarcity of clean, balanced training data, we constructed the AODTA Dataset by aggregating and refining multiple public sources. We benchmarked our approach on both the AVD Dataset and the newly developed AODTA Dataset and further compared performance against a ResNet-50 baseline, which consistently underperformed EfficientNetB4. Our EfficientNetB4 model achieved 96% accuracy in object classification and 90% accuracy in threat-level prediction, underscoring its promise for applications in surveillance, defense, and airspace management. Although the title references detection, this study focuses specifically on classification and threat-level inference using pre-localized airborne object images provided by existing datasets.</description>

      <title>LSTM-MAS: A Long Short-Term Memory Inspired Multi-Agent System for Long-Context Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts remains a fundamental yet unsolved challenge for large language models (LLMs). Existing single-LLM-based methods primarily reduce the context window or optimize the attention mechanism, but they often encounter additional computational costs or constrained expanded context length. While multi-agent-based frameworks can mitigate these limitations, they remain susceptible to the accumulation of errors and the propagation of hallucinations. In this work, we draw inspiration from the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to design a Multi-Agent System called LSTM-MAS, emulating LSTM's hierarchical information flow and gated memory mechanisms for long-context understanding. Specifically, LSTM-MAS organizes agents in a chained architecture, where each node comprises a worker agent for segment-level comprehension, a filter agent for redundancy reduction, a judge agent for continuous error detection, and a manager agent for globally regulates information propagation and retention, analogous to LSTM and its input gate, forget gate, constant error carousel unit, and output gate. These novel designs enable controlled information transfer and selective long-term dependency modeling across textual segments, which can effectively avoid error accumulation and hallucination propagation. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our method. Compared with the previous best multi-agent approach, CoA, our model achieves improvements of 40.93%, 43.70%,121.57% and 33.12%, on NarrativeQA, Qasper, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue, respectively.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM-Based Data Annotation with Error Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models offer a scalable alternative to human coding for data annotation tasks, enabling the scale-up of research across data-intensive domains. While LLMs are already achieving near-human accuracy on objective annotation tasks, their performance on subjective annotation tasks, such as those involving psychological constructs, is less consistent and more prone to errors. Standard evaluation practices typically collapse all annotation errors into a single alignment metric, but this simplified approach may obscure different kinds of errors that affect final analytical conclusions in different ways. Here, we propose a diagnostic evaluation paradigm that incorporates a human-in-the-loop step to separate task-inherent ambiguity from model-driven inaccuracies and assess annotation quality in terms of their potential downstream impacts. We refine this paradigm on ordinal annotation tasks, which are common in subjective annotation. The refined paradigm includes: (1) a diagnostic taxonomy that categorizes LLM annotation errors along two dimensions: source (model-specific vs. task-inherent) and type (boundary ambiguity vs. conceptual misidentification); (2) a lightweight human annotation test to estimate task-inherent ambiguity from LLM annotations; and (3) a computational method to decompose observed LLM annotation errors following our taxonomy. We validate this paradigm on four educational annotation tasks, demonstrating both its conceptual validity and practical utility. Theoretically, our work provides empirical evidence for why excessively high alignment is unrealistic in specific annotation tasks and why single alignment metrics inadequately reflect the quality of LLM annotations. In practice, our paradigm can be a low-cost diagnostic tool that assesses the suitability of a given task for LLM annotation and provides actionable insights for further technical optimization.</description>

      <title>Big Data Workload Profiling for Energy-Aware Cloud Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud data centers face increasing pressure to reduce operational energy consumption as big data workloads continue to grow in scale and complexity. This paper presents a workload aware and energy efficient scheduling framework that profiles CPU utilization, memory demand, and storage IO behavior to guide virtual machine placement decisions. By combining historical execution logs with real time telemetry, the proposed system predicts the energy and performance impact of candidate placements and enables adaptive consolidation while preserving service level agreement compliance. The framework is evaluated using representative Hadoop MapReduce, Spark MLlib, and ETL workloads deployed on a multi node cloud testbed. Experimental results demonstrate consistent energy savings of 15 to 20 percent compared to a baseline scheduler, with negligible performance degradation. These findings highlight workload profiling as a practical and scalable strategy for improving the sustainability of cloud based big data processing environments.</description>

      <title>Double-Calibration: Towards Trustworthy LLMs via Calibrating Knowledge and Reasoning Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by their propensity for hallucination. While augmenting LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) improves factual accuracy, existing KG-augmented methods fail to quantify epistemic uncertainty in both the retrieved evidence and LLMs' reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce DoublyCal, a framework built on a novel double-calibration principle. DoublyCal employs a lightweight proxy model to first generate KG evidence alongside a calibrated evidence confidence. This calibrated supporting evidence then guides a black-box LLM, yielding final predictions that are not only more accurate but also well-calibrated, with confidence scores traceable to the uncertainty of the supporting evidence. Experiments on knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that DoublyCal significantly improves both the accuracy and confidence calibration of black-box LLMs with low token cost.</description>

      <title>R$^2$PO: Decoupling Training Trajectories from Inference Responses for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become a central paradigm for improving LLM reasoning. However, existing methods use a single policy to produce both inference responses and training optimization trajectories. The objective conflict between generating stable inference responses and diverse training trajectories leads to insufficient exploration, which harms reasoning capability. In this paper, to address the problem, we propose R$^2$PO (Residual Rollout Policy Optimization), which introduces a lightweight Residual Rollout-Head atop the policy to decouple training trajectories from inference responses, enabling controlled trajectory diversification during training while keeping inference generation stable. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving average accuracy gains of 3.1% on MATH-500 and 2.4% on APPS, while also reducing formatting errors and mitigating length bias for stable optimization. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RRPO-ARR/Code.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{MemoryRewardBench}$: Benchmarking Reward Models for Long-Term Memory Management in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing works increasingly adopt memory-centric mechanisms to process long contexts in a segment manner, and effective memory management is one of the key capabilities that enables large language models to effectively propagate information across the entire sequence. Therefore, leveraging reward models (RMs) to automatically and reliably evaluate memory quality is critical. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{MemoryRewardBench}$, the first benchmark to systematically study the ability of RMs to evaluate long-term memory management processes. $\texttt{MemoryRewardBench}$ covers both long-context comprehension and long-form generation tasks, featuring 10 distinct settings with different memory management patterns, with context length ranging from 8K to 128K tokens. Evaluations on 13 cutting-edge RMs indicate a diminishing performance gap between open-source and proprietary models, with newer-generation models consistently outperforming their predecessors regardless of parameter count. We further expose the capabilities and fundamental limitations of current RMs in evaluating LLM memory management across diverse settings.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Price Forecasting with Covariate-Guided Experts under Privacy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting in power systems often involves multivariate time series with complex dependencies and strict privacy constraints across regions. Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models.</description>

      <title>Learning Audio-Visual Embeddings with Inferred Latent Interaction Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning robust audio-visual embeddings requires bringing genuinely related audio and visual signals together while filtering out incidental co-occurrences - background noise, unrelated elements, or unannotated events. Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled "train" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because "motorcycle" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes. This graph highlights directional dependencies (e.g., "Train (visual)" -&gt; "Motorcycle (audio)") that expose likely semantic or conditional relationships between classes; these are interpreted as estimated dependency patterns. (3) Latent Interaction Regularizer (LIR): A student network is trained with both metric loss and a regularizer guided by the ILI graph, pulling together embeddings of dependency-linked but unlabeled pairs in proportion to their soft-label probabilities. Experiments on AVE and VEGAS benchmarks show consistent improvements in mean average precision (mAP), demonstrating that integrating inferred latent interactions into embedding learning enhances robustness and semantic coherence.</description>

      <title>Hybrid IDS Using Signature-Based and Anomaly-Based Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential for protecting computer systems and networks against a wide range of cyber threats that continue to evolve over time. IDS are commonly categorized into two main types, each with its own strengths and limitations, such as difficulty in detecting previously unseen attacks and the tendency to generate high false positive rates. This paper presents a comprehensive survey and a conceptual overview of Hybrid IDS, which integrate signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques to enhance attack detection capabilities. The survey examines recent research on Hybrid IDS, classifies existing models into functional categories, and discusses their advantages, limitations, and application domains, including financial systems, air traffic control, and social networks. In addition, recent trends in Hybrid IDS research, such as machine learning-based approaches and cloud-based deployments, are reviewed. Finally, this work outlines potential future research directions aimed at developing more cost-effective Hybrid IDS solutions with improved ability to detect emerging and sophisticated cyberattacks.</description>

      <title>Robust Verification of Concurrent Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems often operate in multi-agent settings and need to make concurrent, strategic decisions, typically in uncertain environments. Verification and control problems for these systems can be tackled with concurrent stochastic games (CSGs), but this model requires transition probabilities to be precisely specified - an unrealistic requirement in many real-world settings. We introduce *robust CSGs* and their subclass *interval CSGs* (ICSGs), which capture epistemic uncertainty about transition probabilities in CSGs. We propose a novel framework for *robust* verification of these models under worst-case assumptions about transition uncertainty. Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms, for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings, the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a selection of large benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Acting Flatterers via LLMs Sycophancy: Combating Clickbait with LLMs Opposing-Stance Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread proliferation of online content has intensified concerns about clickbait, deceptive or exaggerated headlines designed to attract attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing this issue, their effectiveness is often hindered by Sycophancy, a tendency to produce reasoning that matches users' beliefs over truthful ones, which deviates from instruction-following principles. Rather than treating sycophancy as a flaw to be eliminated, this work proposes a novel approach that initially harnesses this behavior to generate contrastive reasoning from opposing perspectives. Specifically, we design a Self-renewal Opposing-stance Reasoning Generation (SORG) framework that prompts LLMs to produce high-quality agree and disagree reasoning pairs for a given news title without requiring ground-truth labels. To utilize the generated reasoning, we develop a local Opposing Reasoning-based Clickbait Detection (ORCD) model that integrates three BERT encoders to represent the title and its associated reasoning. The model leverages contrastive learning, guided by soft labels derived from LLM-generated credibility scores, to enhance detection robustness. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms LLM prompting, fine-tuned smaller language models, and state-of-the-art clickbait detection baselines.</description>

      <title>Less Is More -- Until It Breaks: Security Pitfalls of Vision Token Compression in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual token compression is widely adopted to improve the inference efficiency of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), enabling their deployment in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained scenarios. However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that visual token compression substantially degrades the robustness of LVLMs: models that are robust under uncompressed inference become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. These vulnerabilities are state-specific; failure modes emerge only in the compressed setting and completely disappear when compression is disabled, making them particularly hidden and difficult to diagnose. By analyzing the key stages of the compression process, we identify instability in token importance ranking as the primary cause of this robustness degradation. Small and imperceptible perturbations can significantly alter token rankings, leading the compression mechanism to mistakenly discard task-critical information and ultimately causing model failure. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Compression-Aware Attack to systematically study and exploit this vulnerability. CAA directly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures exclusively under compressed inference. We further extend this approach to more realistic black-box settings and introduce Transfer CAA, where neither the target model nor the compression configuration is accessible. We further evaluate potential defenses and find that they provide only limited protection. Extensive experiments across models, datasets, and compression methods show that visual token compression significantly undermines robustness, revealing a previously overlooked efficiency-security trade-off.</description>

      <title>\textit{FocaLogic}: Logic-Based Interpretation of Visual Model Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretability of modern visual models is crucial, particularly in high-stakes applications. However, existing interpretability methods typically suffer from either reliance on white-box model access or insufficient quantitative rigor. To address these limitations, we introduce FocaLogic, a novel model-agnostic framework designed to interpret and quantify visual model decision-making through logic-based representations. FocaLogic identifies minimal interpretable subsets of visual regions-termed visual focuses-that decisively influence model predictions. It translates these visual focuses into precise and compact logical expressions, enabling transparent and structured interpretations. Additionally, we propose a suite of quantitative metrics, including focus precision, recall, and divergence, to objectively evaluate model behavior across diverse scenarios. Empirical analyses demonstrate FocaLogic's capability to uncover critical insights such as training-induced concentration, increasing focus accuracy through generalization, and anomalous focuses under biases and adversarial attacks. Overall, FocaLogic provides a systematic, scalable, and quantitative solution for interpreting visual models.</description>

      <title>A New Strategy for Artificial Intelligence: Training Foundation Models Directly on Human Brain Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While foundation models have achieved remarkable results across a diversity of domains, they still rely on human-generated data, such as text, as a fundamental source of knowledge. However, this data is ultimately the product of human brains, the filtered projection of a deeper neural complexity. In this paper, we explore a new strategy for artificial intelligence: moving beyond surface-level statistical regularities by training foundation models directly on human brain data. We hypothesize that neuroimaging data could open a window into elements of human cognition that are not accessible through observable actions, and argue that this additional knowledge could be used, alongside classical training data, to overcome some of the current limitations of foundation models. While previous research has demonstrated the possibility to train classical machine learning or deep learning models on neural patterns, this path remains largely unexplored for high-level cognitive functions. Here, we classify the current limitations of foundation models, as well as the promising brain regions and cognitive processes that could be leveraged to address them, along four levels: perception, valuation, execution, and integration. Then, we propose two methods that could be implemented to prioritize the use of limited neuroimaging data for strategically chosen, high-value steps in foundation model training: reinforcement learning from human brain (RLHB) and chain of thought from human brain (CoTHB). We also discuss the potential implications for agents, artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence, as well as the ethical, social, and technical challenges and opportunities. We argue that brain-trained foundation models could represent a realistic and effective middle ground between continuing to scale current architectures and exploring alternative, neuroscience-inspired solutions.</description>

      <title>Automating Parameter Selection in Deep Image Prior for Fluorescence Microscopy Image Denoising via Similarity-Based Parameter Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised deep image prior (DIP) addresses shortcomings of training data requirements and limited generalization associated with supervised deep learning. The performance of DIP depends on the network architecture and the stopping point of its iterative process. Optimizing these parameters for a new image requires time, restricting DIP application in domains where many images need to be processed. Focusing on fluorescence microscopy data, we hypothesize that similar images share comparable optimal parameter configurations for DIP-based denoising, potentially enabling optimization-free DIP for fluorescence microscopy. We generated a calibration (n=110) and validation set (n=55) of semantically different images from an open-source dataset for a network architecture search targeted towards ideal U-net architectures and stopping points. The calibration set represented our transfer basis. The validation set enabled the assessment of which image similarity criterion yields the best results. We then implemented AUTO-DIP, a pipeline for automatic parameter transfer, and compared it to the originally published DIP configuration (baseline) and a state-of-the-art image-specific variational denoising approach. We show that a parameter transfer from the calibration dataset to a test image based on only image metadata similarity (e.g., microscope type, imaged specimen) leads to similar and better performance than a transfer based on quantitative image similarity measures. AUTO-DIP outperforms the baseline DIP (DIP with original DIP parameters) as well as the variational denoising approaches for several open-source test datasets of varying complexity, particularly for very noisy inputs. Applications to locally acquired fluorescence microscopy images further proved superiority of AUTO-DIP.</description>

      <title>Codebook-Injected Dialogue Segmentation for Multi-Utterance Constructs Annotation: LLM-Assisted and Gold-Label-Free Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dialogue Act (DA) annotation typically treats communicative or pedagogical intent as localized to individual utterances or turns. This leads annotators to agree on the underlying action while disagreeing on segment boundaries, reducing apparent reliability. We propose codebook-injected segmentation, which conditions boundary decisions on downstream annotation criteria, and evaluate LLM-based segmenters against standard and retrieval-augmented baselines. To assess these without gold labels, we introduce evaluation metrics for span consistency, distinctiveness, and human-AI distributional agreement. We found DA-awareness produces segments that are internally more consistent than text-only baselines. While LLMs excel at creating construct-consistent spans, coherence-based baselines remain superior at detecting global shifts in dialogue flow. Across two datasets, no single segmenter dominates. Improvements in within-segment coherence frequently trade off against boundary distinctiveness and human-AI distributional agreement. These results highlight segmentation as a consequential design choice that should be optimized for downstream objectives rather than a single performance score.</description>

This study addresses this gap by developing a comprehensive Bangla symptoms-disease dataset containing 758 unique symptom-disease relationships spanning 85 diseases. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we also make our dataset publicly available. The dataset enables the prediction of diseases based on Bangla symptom inputs, supporting healthcare accessibility for Bengali-speaking populations. Using this dataset, we evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict diseases based on symptoms provided in Bangla and analyzed their performance on our dataset. Both soft and hard voting ensemble approaches combining top-performing models achieved 98\% accuracy, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization. Our work establishes a foundational resource for disease prediction in Bangla, paving the way for future advancements in localized health informatics and diagnostic tools. This contribution aims to enhance equitable access to health information for Bangla-speaking communities, particularly for early disease detection and healthcare interventions.</description>

      <title>Conditional Random Fields for Interactive Refinement of Histopathological Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assisting pathologists in the analysis of histopathological images has high clinical value, as it supports cancer detection and staging. In this context, histology foundation models have recently emerged. Among them, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide strong yet imperfect zero-shot predictions. We propose to refine these predictions by adapting Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to histopathological applications, requiring no additional model training. We present HistoCRF, a CRF-based framework, with a novel definition of the pairwise potential that promotes label diversity and leverages expert annotations. We consider three experiments: without annotations, with expert annotations, and with iterative human-in-the-loop annotations that progressively correct misclassified patches. Experiments on five patch-level classification datasets covering different organs and diseases demonstrate average accuracy gains of 16.0% without annotations and 27.5% with only 100 annotations, compared to zero-shot predictions. Moreover, integrating a human in the loop reaches a further gain of 32.6% with the same number of annotations. The code will be made available on https://github.com/tgodelaine/HistoCRF.</description>

      <title>Neural Isomorphic Fields: A Transformer-based Algebraic Numerical Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network models often face challenges when processing very small or very large numbers due to issues such as overflow, underflow, and unstable output variations. To mitigate these problems, we propose using embedding vectors for numbers instead of directly using their raw values. These embeddings aim to retain essential algebraic properties while preventing numerical instabilities. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a fixed-length number embedding vector that preserves algebraic operations, including addition, multiplication, and comparison, within the field of rational numbers. We propose a novel Neural Isomorphic Field, a neural abstraction of algebraic structures such as groups and fields. The elements of this neural field are embedding vectors that maintain algebraic structure during computations. Our experiments demonstrate that addition performs exceptionally well, achieving over 95 percent accuracy on key algebraic tests such as identity, closure, and associativity. In contrast, multiplication exhibits challenges, with accuracy ranging from 53 percent to 73 percent across various algebraic properties. These findings highlight the model's strengths in preserving algebraic properties under addition while identifying avenues for further improvement in handling multiplication.</description>

      <title>Large language models struggle with ethnographic text annotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated text annotation, raising hopes that they might accelerate cross-cultural research by extracting structured data from ethnographic texts. We evaluated 7 state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to annotate 121 ritual features across 567 ethnographic excerpts. Performance was limited, falling well below levels required for reliable automated annotation. Longer texts, features requiring ordinal distinctions, and ambiguous constructs proved particularly difficult. Human inter-coder reliability set an approximate ceiling on LLM accuracy: features that human coders found difficult to agree upon were also difficult for LLMs. Yet even on features where humans reliably agreed, models fell short of human performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs cannot yet substitute for human expertise in ethnographic annotation.</description>

      <title>Powerful Training-Free Membership Inference Against Autoregressive Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuned language models pose significant privacy risks, as they may memorize and expose sensitive information from their training data. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled framework for auditing these risks, yet existing methods achieve limited detection rates, particularly at the low false-positive thresholds required for practical privacy auditing. We present EZ-MIA, a membership inference attack that exploits a key observation: memorization manifests most strongly at error positions, specifically tokens where the model predicts incorrectly yet still shows elevated probability for training examples. We introduce the Error Zone (EZ) score, which measures the directional imbalance of probability shifts at error positions relative to a pretrained reference model. This principled statistic requires only two forward passes per query and no model training of any kind. On WikiText with GPT-2, EZ-MIA achieves 3.8x higher detection than the previous state-of-the-art under identical conditions (66.3% versus 17.5% true positive rate at 1% false positive rate), with near-perfect discrimination (AUC 0.98). At the stringent 0.1% FPR threshold critical for real-world auditing, we achieve 8x higher detection than prior work (14.0% versus 1.8%), requiring no reference model training. These gains extend to larger architectures: on AG News with Llama-2-7B, we achieve 3x higher detection (46.7% versus 15.8% TPR at 1% FPR). These results establish that privacy risks of fine-tuned language models are substantially greater than previously understood, with implications for both privacy auditing and deployment decisions.

      <title>SynQP: A Framework and Metrics for Evaluating the Quality and Privacy Risk of Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of synthetic data in health applications raises privacy concerns, yet the lack of open frameworks for privacy evaluations has slowed its adoption. A major challenge is the absence of accessible benchmark datasets for evaluating privacy risks, due to difficulties in acquiring sensitive data. To address this, we introduce SynQP, an open framework for benchmarking privacy in synthetic data generation (SDG) using simulated sensitive data, ensuring that original data remains confidential. We also highlight the need for privacy metrics that fairly account for the probabilistic nature of machine learning models. As a demonstration, we use SynQP to benchmark CTGAN and propose a new identity disclosure risk metric that offers a more accurate estimation of privacy risks compared to existing approaches. Our work provides a critical tool for improving the transparency and reliability of privacy evaluations, enabling safer use of synthetic data in health-related applications. % In our quality evaluations, non-private models achieved near-perfect machine-learning efficacy \(\ge0.97\). Our privacy assessments (Table II) reveal that DP consistently lowers both identity disclosure risk (SD-IDR) and membership-inference attack risk (SD-MIA), with all DP-augmented models staying below the 0.09 regulatory threshold.

      <title>Bengali Text Classification: An Evaluation of Large Language Model Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bengali text classification is a Significant task in natural language processing (NLP), where text is categorized into predefined labels. Unlike English, Bengali faces challenges due to the lack of extensive annotated datasets and pre-trained language models. This study explores the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in classifying Bengali newspaper articles. The dataset used, obtained from Kaggle, consists of articles from Prothom Alo, a major Bangladeshi newspaper. Three instruction-tuned LLMs LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, LLaMA 3.2 3B Instruct, and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct were evaluated for this task under the same classification framework. Among the evaluated models, Qwen 2.5 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 72%, showing particular strength in the "Sports" category. In comparison, LLaMA 3.1 and LLaMA 3.2 attained accuracies of 53% and 56%, respectively. The findings highlight the effectiveness of LLMs in Bengali text classification, despite the scarcity of resources for Bengali NLP. Future research will focus on exploring additional models, addressing class imbalance issues, and refining fine-tuning approaches to improve classification performance.</description>

      <title>Human-Human-AI Triadic Programming: Uncovering the Role of AI Agent and the Value of Human Partner in Collaborative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI assistance becomes embedded in programming practice, researchers have increasingly examined how these systems help learners generate code and work more efficiently. However, these studies often position AI as a replacement for human collaboration and overlook the social and learning-oriented aspects that emerge in collaborative programming. Our work introduces human-human-AI (HHAI) triadic programming, where an AI agent serves as an additional collaborator rather than a substitute for a human partner. Through a within-subjects study with 20 participants, we show that triadic collaboration enhances collaborative learning and social presence compared to the dyadic human-AI (HAI) baseline. In the triadic HHAI conditions, participants relied significantly less on AI-generated code in their work. This effect was strongest in the HHAI-shared condition, where participants had an increased sense of responsibility to understand AI suggestions before applying them. These findings demonstrate how triadic settings activate socially shared regulation of learning by making AI use visible and accountable to a human peer, suggesting that AI systems that augment rather than automate peer collaboration can better preserve the learning processes that collaborative programming relies on.</description>

      <title>Segment and Matte Anything in a Unified Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) has recently pushed the boundaries of segmentation by demonstrating zero-shot generalization and flexible prompting after training on over one billion masks. Despite this, its mask prediction accuracy often falls short of the precision required in real-world applications. While several refinement modules have been proposed to boost SAM's segmentation quality, achieving highly accurate object delineation within a single, unified framework remains an open challenge. Furthermore, interactive image matting, which aims to generate fine-grained alpha mattes guided by diverse user hints, has not yet been explored in the context of SAM. Insights from recent studies highlight strong correlations between segmentation and matting, suggesting the feasibility of a unified model capable of both tasks. In this paper, we introduce Segment And Matte Anything (SAMA), a lightweight extension of SAM that delivers high-quality interactive image segmentation and matting with minimal extra parameters. Our Multi-View Localization Encoder (MVLE) captures detailed features from local views, while the Localization Adapter (Local-Adapter) refines mask outputs by recovering subtle boundary details. We also incorporate two prediction heads for each task into the architecture to generate segmentation and matting masks, simultaneously. Trained on a diverse dataset aggregated from publicly available sources, SAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple segmentation and matting benchmarks, showcasing its adaptability and effectiveness in a wide range of downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Diagnostic Performance via Large-Resolution Inference Optimization for Pathology Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their prominent performance on tasks such as ROI classification and segmentation, many pathology foundation models remain constrained by a specific input size e.g. 224 x 224, creating substantial inefficiencies when applied to whole-slide images (WSIs), which span thousands of resolutions. A naive strategy is to either enlarge inputs or downsample the WSIs. However, enlarging inputs results in prohibitive GPU memory consumption, while downsampling alters the microns-per-pixel resolution and obscures critical morphological details. To overcome these limitations, we propose an space- and time- efficient inference strategy that sparsifies attention using spatially aware neighboring blocks and filters out non-informative tokens through global attention scores. This design substantially reduces GPU memory and runtime during high-resolution WSI inference while preserving and even improving the downstream performance, enabling inference at higher resolutions under the same GPU budget. The experimental results show that our method can achieves up to an 7.67% improvement in the ROI classification and compatible results in segmentation.</description>

      <title>Aletheia: What Makes RLVR For Code Verifiers Tick?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-domain thinking verifiers trained via Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are a prominent fixture of the Large Language Model (LLM) post-training pipeline, owing to their ability to robustly rate and rerank model outputs. However, the adoption of such verifiers towards code generation has been comparatively sparse, with execution feedback constituting the dominant signal. Nonetheless, code verifiers remain valuable toward judging model outputs in scenarios where execution feedback is hard to obtain and are a potentially powerful addition to the code generation post-training toolbox. To this end, we create and open-source Aletheia, a controlled testbed that enables execution-grounded evaluation of code verifiers' robustness across disparate policy models and covariate shifts. We examine components of the RLVR-based verifier training recipe widely credited for its success: (1) intermediate thinking traces, (2) learning from negative samples, and (3) on-policy training. While experiments show the optimality of RLVR, we uncover important opportunities to simplify the recipe. Particularly, despite code verification exhibiting positive training- and inference-time scaling, on-policy learning stands out as the key component at small verifier sizes, and thinking-based training emerges as the most important component at larger scales.</description>

      <title>Do Neural Codecs Generalize? A Controlled Study Across Unseen Languages and Non-Speech Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates three crucial yet underexplored aspects of the generalization capabilities of neural audio codecs (NACs): (i) whether NACs can generalize to unseen languages during pre-training, (ii) whether speech-only pre-trained NACs can effectively generalize to non-speech applications such as environmental sounds, music, and animal vocalizations, and (iii) whether incorporating non-speech data during pre-training can improve performance on both speech and non-speech tasks. Existing studies typically rely on off-the-shelf NACs for comparison, which limits insight due to variations in implementation. In this work, we train NACs from scratch using strictly controlled configurations and carefully curated pre-training data to enable fair comparisons. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of NAC performance on both signal reconstruction quality and downstream applications using 11 metrics. Our results show that NACs can generalize to unseen languages during pre-training, speech-only pre-trained NACs exhibit degraded performance on non-speech tasks, and incorporating non-speech data during pre-training improves performance on non-speech tasks while maintaining comparable performance on speech tasks.</description>

      <title>Speculative Sampling with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference time latency has remained an open challenge for real world applications of large language models (LLMs). State-of-the-art (SOTA) speculative sampling (SpS) methods for LLMs, like EAGLE-3, use tree-based drafting to explore multiple candidate continuations in parallel. However, the hyperparameters controlling the tree structure are static, which limits flexibility and efficiency across diverse contexts and domains. We introduce Reinforcement learning for Speculative Sampling (Re-SpS), the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for draft tree hyperparameter optimization. Re-SpS dynamically adjusts draft tree hyperparameters in real-time, learning context-aware policies that maximize generation speed by balancing speculative aggression with computational overhead. It leverages efficient state representations from target model hidden states and introduces multi-step action persistence for better context modeling. Evaluation results across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the SOTA method EAGLE-3, achieving up to 5.45$\times$ speedup over the backbone LLM and up to 1.12$\times$ speedup compared to EAGLE-3 across five diverse benchmarks, with no loss in output fidelity.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Driven Masked Multiscale Reconstruction for PPG Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable foundation models have the potential to transform digital health by learning transferable representations from large-scale biosignals collected in everyday settings. While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features. Together, these results highlight the potential of MMR as a step toward generalizable PPG foundation models.</description>

Abstract: Enabling intuitive, language-driven interaction with surgical scenes is a critical step toward intelligent operating rooms and autonomous surgical robotic assistance. However, the task of referring segmentation, localizing surgical instruments based on natural language descriptions, remains underexplored in surgical videos, with existing approaches struggling to generalize due to reliance on static visual cues and predefined instrument names. In this work, we introduce SurgRef, a novel motion-guided framework that grounds free-form language expressions in instrument motion, capturing how tools move and interact across time, rather than what they look like. This allows models to understand and segment instruments even under occlusion, ambiguity, or unfamiliar terminology. To train and evaluate SurgRef, we present Ref-IMotion, a diverse, multi-institutional video dataset with dense spatiotemporal masks and rich motion-centric expressions. SurgRef achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and generalization across surgical procedures, setting a new benchmark for robust, language-driven surgical video segmentation.</description>

      <title>Proc3D: Procedural 3D Generation and Parametric Editing of 3D Shapes with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating 3D models has traditionally been a complex task requiring specialized expertise. While recent advances in generative AI have sought to automate this process, existing methods produce non-editable representation, such as meshes or point clouds, limiting their adaptability for iterative design. In this paper, we introduce Proc3D, a system designed to generate editable 3D models while enabling real-time modifications. At its core, Proc3D introduces procedural compact graph (PCG), a graph representation of 3D models, that encodes the algorithmic rules and structures necessary for generating the model. This representation exposes key parameters, allowing intuitive manual adjustments via sliders and checkboxes, as well as real-time, automated modifications through natural language prompts using Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate Proc3D's capabilities using two generative approaches: GPT-4o with in-context learning (ICL) and a fine-tuned LLAMA-3 model. Experimental results show that Proc3D outperforms existing methods in editing efficiency, achieving more than 400x speedup over conventional approaches that require full regeneration for each modification. Additionally, Proc3D improves ULIP scores by 28%, a metric that evaluates the alignment between generated 3D models and text prompts. By enabling text-aligned 3D model generation along with precise, real-time parametric edits, Proc3D facilitates highly accurate text-based image editing applications.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Label-Guided Summarization of Procedural and Instructional Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video summarization helps turn long videos into clear, concise representations that are easier to review, document, and analyze, especially in high-stakes domains like surgical training. Prior work has progressed from using basic visual features like color, motion, and structural changes to using pre-trained vision-language models that can better understand what's happening in the video (semantics) and capture temporal flow, resulting in more context-aware video summarization. We propose a three-stage framework, PRISM: Procedural Representation via Integrated Semantic and Multimodal analysis, that produces semantically grounded video summaries. PRISM combines adaptive visual sampling, label-driven keyframe anchoring, and contextual validation using a large language model (LLM). Our method ensures that selected frames reflect meaningful and procedural transitions while filtering out generic or hallucinated content, resulting in contextually coherent summaries across both domain-specific and instructional videos. We evaluate our method on instructional and activity datasets, using reference summaries for instructional videos. Despite sampling fewer than 5% of the original frames, our summaries retain 84% semantic content while improving over baselines by as much as 33%. Our approach generalizes across procedural and domain-specific video tasks, achieving strong performance with both semantic alignment and precision.</description>

      <title>Plan, Verify and Fill: A Structured Parallel Decoding Approach for Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) present a promising non-sequential paradigm for text generation, distinct from standard autoregressive (AR) approaches. However, current decoding strategies often adopt a reactive stance, underutilizing the global bidirectional context to dictate global trajectories. To address this, we propose Plan-Verify-Fill (PVF), a training-free paradigm that grounds planning via quantitative validation. PVF actively constructs a hierarchical skeleton by prioritizing high-leverage semantic anchors and employs a verification protocol to operationalize pragmatic structural stopping where further deliberation yields diminishing returns. Extensive evaluations on LLaDA-8B-Instruct and Dream-7B-Instruct demonstrate that PVF reduces the Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) by up to 65% compared to confidence-based parallel decoding across benchmark datasets, unlocking superior efficiency without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>AQUA-Bench: Beyond Finding Answers to Knowing When There Are None in Audio Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-aware large language models have shown strong performance on audio question answering. However, existing benchmarks mainly cover answerable questions and overlook the challenge of unanswerable ones, where no reliable answer can be inferred from the audio. Such cases are common in real-world settings, where questions may be misleading, ill-posed, or incompatible with the information. To address this gap, we present AQUA-Bench, a benchmark for Audio Question Unanswerability Assessment. It systematically evaluates three scenarios: Absent Answer Detection (the correct option is missing), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (choices are categorically mismatched with the question), and Incompatible Audio Question Detection (the question is irrelevant or lacks sufficient grounding in the audio). By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy. Our experiments suggest that while models excel on standard answerable tasks, they often face notable challenges with unanswerable ones, pointing to a blind spot in current audio-language understanding.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Framework for Breast Cancer Detection Using Pyramid Adaptive Atrous Convolution, Transformer Integration, and Multi-Scale Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, and its accurate and timely diagnosis plays a critical role in improving treatment outcomes. This thesis presents an innovative framework for detecting malignant masses in mammographic images by integrating the Pyramid Adaptive Atrous Convolution (PAAC) and Transformer architectures. The proposed approach utilizes Multi-Scale Feature Fusion to enhance the extraction of features from benign and malignant tissues and combines Dice Loss and Focal Loss functions to improve the model's learning process, effectively reducing errors in binary breast cancer classification and achieving high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, a comprehensive dataset of breast cancer images from INbreast, MIAS, and DDSM was preprocessed through data augmentation and contrast enhancement and resized to 227x227 pixels for model training. Leveraging the Transformer's ability to manage long-range dependencies with Self-Attention mechanisms, the proposed model achieved high accuracy in detecting cancerous masses, outperforming foundational models such as BreastNet, DeepMammo, Multi-Scale CNN, Swin-Unet, and SegFormer. The final evaluation results for the proposed model include an accuracy of 98.5\%, sensitivity of 97.8\%, specificity of 96.3\%, F1-score of 98.2\%, and overall precision of 97.9\%. These metrics demonstrate a significant improvement over traditional methods and confirm the model's effectiveness in identifying cancerous masses in complex scenarios and large datasets. This model shows potential as a reliable and efficient tool for breast cancer diagnosis and can be effectively integrated into medical diagnostic systems.</description>

      <title>Soft Shadow Diffusion (SSD): Physics-inspired Learning for 3D Computational Periscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional imaging requires a line of sight to create accurate visual representations of a scene. In certain circumstances, however, obtaining a suitable line of sight may be impractical, dangerous, or even impossible. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses this challenge by reconstructing the scene from indirect measurements. Recently, passive NLOS methods that use an ordinary photograph of the subtle shadow cast onto a visible wall by the hidden scene have gained interest. These methods are currently limited to 1D or low-resolution 2D color imaging or to localizing a hidden object whose shape is approximately known. Here, we generalize this class of methods and demonstrate a 3D reconstruction of a hidden scene from an ordinary NLOS photograph. To achieve this, we propose a novel reformulation of the light transport model that conveniently decomposes the hidden scene into \textit{light-occluding} and \textit{non-light-occluding} components to yield a separable non-linear least squares (SNLLS) inverse problem. We develop two solutions: A gradient-based optimization method and a physics-inspired neural network approach, which we call Soft Shadow diffusion (SSD). Despite the challenging ill-conditioned inverse problem encountered here, our approaches are effective on numerous 3D scenes in real experimental scenarios. Moreover, SSD is trained in simulation but generalizes well to unseen classes in simulation and real-world NLOS scenes. SSD also shows surprising robustness to noise and ambient illumination.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization: Rank Manipulation for Vision-Language Model Rankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are rapidly replacing unimodal encoders in modern retrieval and recommendation systems. While their capabilities are well-documented, their robustness against adversarial manipulation in competitive ranking scenarios remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we uncover a critical vulnerability in VLM-based product search: multimodal ranking attacks. We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes. Unlike existing attacks that treat modalities in isolation, MGEO employs an alternating gradient-based optimization strategy to exploit the deep cross-modal coupling within the VLM. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets using state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our coordinated attack significantly outperforms text-only and image-only baselines. These findings reveal that multimodal synergy, typically a strength of VLMs, can be weaponized to compromise the integrity of search rankings without triggering conventional content filters.</description>

      <title>Simulated Annealing Enhances Theory-of-Mind Reasoning in Autoregressive Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive language models are next-token predictors and have been criticized for only optimizing surface plausibility (i.e., local coherence) rather than maintaining correct latent-state representations (i.e., global coherence). Because Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks crucially depend on reasoning about latent mental states of oneself and others, such models are therefore often thought to fail at ToM. While post-training methods can improve ToM performance, we show that strong ToM capability can be recovered directly from the base model without any additional weight updates or verifications. Our approach builds on recent power-sampling methods (Karan &amp; Du, 2025) that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from sharpened sequence-level (rather than token-level) probability distributions of autoregressive language models. We further find that incorporating annealing, where the tempered distribution is gradually shifted from high to low temperature, substantially improves ToM performance over fixed-temperature power sampling. Together, these results suggest that sampling-based optimization provides a powerful way to extract latent capabilities from language models without retraining.</description>

      <title>Predictive Prototyping: Evaluating Design Concepts with ChatGPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design-build-test cycle is essential for innovation, but physical prototyping is often slow and expensive. Although physics-based simulation and strategic prototyping can reduce cost, meaningful evaluation is frequently constrained until an integrated prototype is built. This paper investigates whether a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) can predict information typically obtained through prototyping, including cost, performance, and perceived usability. We introduce a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to emulate design feedback using OpenAI GPT-4o, grounded in prototyping data scraped from Instructables.com to increase access to relevant precedent. Two studies are reported. First, a controlled experiment compares GPT-RAG and human designers, who receive design sketches and predict cost, performance, and usability; predictions are evaluated against ground-truth results from physical prototypes. Second, we report an applied demonstration in which a physical prototype is produced from GPT-RAG recommendations and compared with a commercial baseline and a topology-optimized design. Results show that GPT-RAG provides more accurate cost and performance estimates than individual or crowd human estimates, while yielding comparable usability insights; the GPT-RAG-informed prototype also outperforms both comparison prototypes. Repeated querying with response averaging significantly improves accuracy, suggesting that LLMs can emulate crowd aggregation effects consistent with the law of large numbers.</description>

      <title>CytoCLIP: Learning Cytoarchitectural Characteristics in Developing Human Brain Using Contrastive Language Image Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The functions of different regions of the human brain are closely linked to their distinct cytoarchitecture, which is defined by the spatial arrangement and morphology of the cells. Identifying brain regions by their cytoarchitecture enables various scientific analyses of the brain. However, delineating these areas manually in brain histological sections is time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge. An automated approach is necessary to minimize the effort needed from human experts. To address this, we propose CytoCLIP, a suite of vision-language models derived from pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) frameworks to learn joint visual-text representations of brain cytoarchitecture. CytoCLIP comprises two model variants: one is trained using low-resolution whole-region images to understand the overall cytoarchitectural pattern of an area, and the other is trained on high-resolution image tiles for detailed cellular-level representation. The training dataset is created from NISSL-stained histological sections of developing fetal brains of different gestational weeks. It includes 86 distinct regions for low-resolution images and 384 brain regions for high-resolution tiles. We evaluate the model's understanding of the cytoarchitecture and generalization ability using region classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Multiple experiments are performed under various data setups, including data from samples of different ages and sectioning planes. Experimental results demonstrate that CytoCLIP outperforms existing methods. It achieves an F1 score of 0.87 for whole-region classification and 0.91 for high-resolution image tile classification.</description>

      <title>Conversational Context Classification: A Representation Engineering Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demands effective safeguards for their operation, particularly concerning their tendency to generate out-of-context responses. A key challenge is accurately detecting when LLMs stray from expected conversational norms, manifesting as topic shifts, factual inaccuracies, or outright hallucinations. Traditional anomaly detection struggles to directly apply within contextual semantics. This paper outlines our experiment in exploring the use of Representation Engineering (RepE) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to identify subspaces within the internal states of LLMs that represent a specific context. By training OCSVM on in-context examples, we establish a robust boundary within the LLM's hidden state latent space. We evaluate out study with two open source LLMs - Llama and Qwen models in specific contextual domain. Our approach entailed identifying the optimal layers within the LLM's internal state subspaces that strongly associates with the context of interest. Our evaluation results showed promising results in identifying the subspace for a specific context. Aside from being useful in detecting in or out of context conversation threads, this research work contributes to the study of better interpreting LLMs.</description>

      <title>TimeGMM: Single-Pass Probabilistic Forecasting via Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models with Reversible Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic time series forecasting is crucial for quantifying future uncertainty, with significant applications in fields such as energy and finance. However, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive sampling or restrictive parametric assumptions to characterize future distributions, which limits predictive performance and introduces distributional mismatch. To address these challenges, this paper presents TimeGMM, a novel probabilistic forecasting framework based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) that captures complex future distributions in a single forward pass. A key component is GMM-adapted Reversible Instance Normalization (GRIN), a novel module designed to dynamically adapt to temporal-probabilistic distribution shifts. The framework integrates a dedicated Temporal Encoder (TE-Module) with a Conditional Temporal-Probabilistic Decoder (CTPD-Module) to jointly capture temporal dependencies and mixture distribution parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeGMM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving maximum improvements of 22.48\% in CRPS and 21.23\% in NMAE.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Globally-Diverse Adversarial Attack for Vision-Language Pre-training Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, particularly in black-box scenarios. Existing multimodal attacks often suffer from limited perturbation diversity and unstable multi-stage pipelines. To address these challenges, we propose 2S-GDA, a two-stage globally-diverse attack framework. The proposed method first introduces textual perturbations through a globally-diverse strategy by combining candidate text expansion with globally-aware replacement. To enhance visual diversity, image-level perturbations are generated using multi-scale resizing and block-shuffle rotation. Extensive experiments on VLP models demonstrate that 2S-GDA consistently improves attack success rates over state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 11.17\% in black-box settings. Our framework is modular and can be easily combined with existing methods to further enhance adversarial transferability.</description>

Abstract: We present a semantics modulated, multi scale Transformer for 3D gaze estimation. Our model conditions CLIP global features with learnable prototype banks (illumination, head pose, background, direction), fuses these prototype-enriched global vectors with CLIP patch tokens and high-resolution CNN tokens in a unified attention space, and replaces several FFN blocks with routed/shared Mixture of Experts to increase conditional capacity. Evaluated on MPIIFaceGaze, EYEDIAP, Gaze360 and ETH-XGaze, our model achieves new state of the art angular errors of 2.49{\deg}, 3.22{\deg}, 10.16{\deg}, and 1.44{\deg}, demonstrating up to a 64% relative improvement over previously reported results. ablations attribute gains to prototype conditioning, cross scale fusion, MoE and hyperparameter.

Abstract: Automation in data analysis has been a long-time pursuit. Current agentic LLM shows a promising solution towards it. Like DeepAnalyze, DataSage, and Datawise. They are all powerful agentic frameworks for automatic fine-grained analysis and are powered by LLM-based agentic tool calling ability. However, what about powered by a preset AutoML-like workflow? If we traverse all possible exploration, like Xn itself`s statistics, Xn1-Xn2 relationships, Xn to all other, and finally explain? Our Explanova is such an attempt: Cheaper due to a Local Small LLM.</description>

      <title>The Expert Validation Framework (EVF): Enabling Domain Expert Control in AI Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) systems promise to transform knowledge work by automating a range of tasks, yet their deployment in enterprise settings remains hindered by the lack of systematic quality assurance mechanisms. We present an Expert Validation Framework that places domain experts at the center of building software with GenAI components, enabling them to maintain authoritative control over system behavior through structured specification, testing, validation, and continuous monitoring processes. Our framework addresses the critical gap between AI capabilities and organizational trust by establishing a rigorous, expert-driven methodology for ensuring quality across diverse GenAI applications. Through a four-stage implementation process encompassing specification, system creation, validation, and production monitoring, the framework enables organizations to leverage GenAI capabilities while maintaining expert oversight and quality standards.</description>

      <title>IceWatch: Forecasting Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) using Multimodal Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) pose a serious threat in high mountain regions. They are hazardous to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems further downstream. The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities.</description>

      <title>Efficient Privacy-Preserving Retrieval Augmented Generation with Distance-Preserving Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RAG has emerged as a key technique for enhancing response quality of LLMs without high computational cost. In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced cloud storage. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces privacy risks. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed but most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. We propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To mitigate query analysis, we introduce DP by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns. Experimental results show that ppRAG achieves efficient processing throughput, high retrieval accuracy, strong privacy guarantees, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained users seeking secure cloud-augmented LLMs.</description>

      <title>How Well Do LLMs Predict Human Behavior? A Measure of their Pretrained Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to predict human behavior. We propose a measure for evaluating how much knowledge a pretrained LLM brings to such a prediction: its equivalent sample size, defined as the amount of task-specific data needed to match the predictive accuracy of the LLM. We estimate this measure by comparing the prediction error of a fixed LLM in a given domain to that of flexible machine learning models trained on increasing samples of domain-specific data. We further provide a statistical inference procedure by developing a new asymptotic theory for cross-validated prediction error. Finally, we apply this method to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We find that LLMs encode considerable predictive information for some economic variables but much less for others, suggesting that their value as substitutes for domain-specific data differs markedly across settings.</description>

      <title>Zero-Permission Manipulation: Can We Trust Large Multimodal Model Powered GUI Agents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large multimodal model powered GUI agents are emerging as high-privilege operators on mobile platforms, entrusted with perceiving screen content and injecting inputs. However, their design operates under the implicit assumption of Visual Atomicity: that the UI state remains invariant between observation and action. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface.
  We present Action Rebinding, a novel attack that allows a seemingly-benign app with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.
  We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal). Our findings reveal a fundamental architectural flaw in current agent-OS integration and provide critical insights for the secure design of future agent systems.

      <title>SimpleMatch: A Simple and Strong Baseline for Semantic Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in semantic correspondence have been largely driven by the use of pre-trained large-scale models. However, a limitation of these approaches is their dependence on high-resolution input images to achieve optimal performance, which results in considerable computational overhead. In this work, we address a fundamental limitation in current methods: the irreversible fusion of adjacent keypoint features caused by deep downsampling operations. This issue is triggered when semantically distinct keypoints fall within the same downsampled receptive field (e.g., 16x16 patches). To address this issue, we present SimpleMatch, a simple yet effective framework for semantic correspondence that delivers strong performance even at low resolutions. We propose a lightweight upsample decoder that progressively recovers spatial detail by upsampling deep features to 1/4 resolution, and a multi-scale supervised loss that ensures the upsampled features retain discriminative features across different spatial scales. In addition, we introduce sparse matching and window-based localization to optimize training memory usage and reduce it by 51%. At a resolution of 252x252 (3.3x smaller than current SOTA methods), SimpleMatch achieves superior performance with 84.1% PCK@0.1 on the SPair-71k benchmark. We believe this framework provides a practical and efficient baseline for future research in semantic correspondence. Code is available at: https://github.com/hailong23-jin/SimpleMatch.</description>

      <title>From Prompts to Pavement: LMMs-based Agentic Behavior-Tree Generation Framework for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require adaptive behavior planners to navigate unpredictable, real-world environments safely. Traditional behavior trees (BTs) offer structured decision logic but are inherently static and demand labor-intensive manual tuning, limiting their applicability at SAE Level 5 autonomy. This paper presents an agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal vision models (LVMs) to generate and adapt BTs on the fly. A specialized Descriptor agent applies chain-of-symbols prompting to assess scene criticality, a Planner agent constructs high-level sub-goals via in-context learning, and a Generator agent synthesizes executable BT sub-trees in XML format. Integrated into a CARLA+Nav2 simulation, our system triggers only upon baseline BT failure, demonstrating successful navigation around unexpected obstacles (e.g., street blockage) with no human intervention. Compared to a static BT baseline, this approach is a proof-of-concept that extends to diverse driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Entity-Based Framework for Auditing Bias in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches to bias evaluation in large language models (LLMs) trade ecological validity for statistical control, relying on artificial prompts that poorly reflect real-world use, or on naturalistic tasks that lack scale and rigor. We introduce a scalable bias-auditing framework using named entities as probes to measure structural disparities in model behavior. We show that synthetic data reliably reproduces bias patterns observed in natural text, enabling large-scale analysis. Using this approach, we conduct the largest bias audit to date, comprising 1.9 billion data points across multiple entity types, tasks, languages, models, and prompting strategies. Our results reveal systematic biases: models penalize right-wing politicians, favor left-wing politicians, prefer Western and wealthy nations over the Global South, favor Western companies, and penalize firms in the defense and pharmaceutical sectors. While instruction tuning reduces bias, increasing model scale amplifies it, and prompting in Chinese or Russian does not attenuate Western-aligned preferences. These results indicate that LLMs should undergo rigorous auditing before deployment in high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>NADIR: Differential Attention Flow for Non-Autoregressive Transliteration in Indic Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we argue that not all sequence-to-sequence tasks require the strong inductive biases of autoregressive (AR) models. Tasks like multilingual transliteration, code refactoring, grammatical correction or text normalization often rely on local dependencies where the full modeling capacity of AR models can be overkill, creating a trade-off between their high accuracy and high inference latency. While non-autoregressive (NAR) models offer speed, they typically suffer from hallucinations and poor length control. To explore this trade-off, we focus on the multilingual transliteration task in Indic languages and introduce NADIR, a novel NAR architecture designed to strike a balance between speed and accuracy. NADIR integrates a Differential Transformer and a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism, enabling it to robustly model complex character mappings without sequential dependencies. NADIR achieves over a 13x speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art AR baseline. It maintains a competitive mean Character Error Rate of 15.78%, compared to 14.44% for the AR model and 21.88% for a standard NAR equivalent. Importantly, NADIR reduces Repetition errors by 49.53%, Substitution errors by 24.45%, Omission errors by 32.92%, and Insertion errors by 16.87%. This work provides a practical blueprint for building fast and reliable NAR systems, effectively bridging the gap between AR accuracy and the demands of real-time, large-scale deployment.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Dirac Delta: Mitigating Diversity Collapse in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Versatile Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-tuning large-scale generative models, such as diffusion and flow models, to align with complex human preferences and user-specified tasks. A fundamental limitation remains \textit{the curse of diversity collapse}, where the objective formulation and optimization landscape inherently collapse the policy to a Dirac delta distribution. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}ive\textbf{R}sity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Reinforcement \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning for Versatile Image Generation), an innovative framework that systematically incentivizes output diversity throughout the on-policy fine-tuning process, reconciling strong task alignment with high generation diversity to enhance versatility essential for applications that demand diverse candidate generations. We approach the problem across three representative perspectives: i) \textbf{sampling} a reward-concentrated subset that filters out reward outliers to prevent premature collapse; ii) \textbf{prompting} with stochastic variations to expand the conditioning space, and iii) \textbf{optimization} of the intra-group diversity with a potential-based reward shaping mechanism. Experimental results show that DRIFT achieves superior Pareto dominance regarding task alignment and generation diversity, yielding a $ 9.08\%\!\sim\! 43.46\%$ increase in diversity at equivalent alignment levels and a $ 59.65\% \!\sim\! 65.86\%$ increase in alignment at equivalent levels of diversity.</description>

Abstract: Emotion detection from faces is one of the machine learning problems needed for human-computer interaction. The variety of methods used is enormous, which motivated an in-depth review of articles and scientific studies. Three of the most interesting and best solutions are selected, followed by the selection of three datasets that stood out for the diversity and number of images in them. The selected neural networks are trained, and then a series of experiments are performed to compare their performance, including testing on different datasets than a model was trained on. This reveals weaknesses in existing solutions, including differences between datasets, unequal levels of difficulty in recognizing certain emotions and the challenges in differentiating between closely related emotions.</description>

      <title>Explainable Machine Learning for Pediatric Dental Risk Stratification Using Socio-Demographic Determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Pediatric dental disease remains one of the most prevalent and inequitable chronic health conditions worldwide. Although strong epidemiological evidence links oral health outcomes to socio-economic and demographic determinants, most artificial intelligence (AI) applications in dentistry rely on image-based diagnosis and black-box prediction models, limiting transparency and ethical applicability in pediatric populations.
  Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an explainable machine learning framework for pediatric dental risk stratification that prioritizes interpretability, calibration, and ethical deployment over maximal predictive accuracy.
  Methods: A supervised machine learning model was trained using population-level pediatric data including age, income-to-poverty ratio, race/ethnicity, gender, and medical history. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves. Explainability was achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide global and individual-level interpretation of predictions.
  Results: The model achieved modest discrimination (AUC = 0.61) with conservative calibration, underestimating risk at higher probability levels. SHAP analysis identified age and income-to-poverty ratio as the strongest contributors to predicted risk, followed by race/ethnicity and gender.
  Conclusion: Explainable machine learning enables transparent, prevention-oriented pediatric dental risk stratification and supports population screening and equitable resource allocation rather than diagnostic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Orthogonalized Policy Optimization:Decoupling Sampling Geometry from Optimization Geometry in RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent alignment methods for large language models, including PPO, DPO, and IPO, are often presented as distinct algorithms. In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training.</description>

      <title>Purification Before Fusion: Toward Mask-Free Speech Enhancement for Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) typically improves recognition accuracy in noisy environments by integrating noise-immune visual cues with audio signals. Nevertheless, high-noise audio inputs are prone to introducing adverse interference into the feature fusion process. To mitigate this, recent AVSR methods often adopt mask-based strategies to filter audio noise during feature interaction and fusion, yet such methods risk discarding semantically relevant information alongside noise. In this work, we propose an end-to-end noise-robust AVSR framework coupled with speech enhancement, eliminating the need for explicit noise mask generation. This framework leverages a Conformer-based bottleneck fusion module to implicitly refine noisy audio features with video assistance. By reducing modality redundancy and enhancing inter-modal interactions, our method preserves speech semantic integrity to achieve robust recognition performance. Experimental evaluations on the public LRS3 benchmark suggest that our method outperforms prior advanced mask-based baselines under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Aware Neurosymbolic Uncertainty Quantification with Bayesian Deep Learning for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications require models that deliver trustworthy uncertainty estimates while respecting domain constraints. Existing uncertainty quantification methods lack mechanisms to incorporate symbolic scientific knowledge, while neurosymbolic approaches operate deterministically without principled uncertainty modeling. We introduce the Constraint-Aware Neurosymbolic Uncertainty Framework (CANUF), unifying Bayesian deep learning with differentiable symbolic reasoning. The architecture comprises three components: automated constraint extraction from scientific literature, probabilistic neural backbone with variational inference, and differentiable constraint satisfaction layer ensuring physical consistency. Experiments on Materials Project (140,000+ materials), QM9 molecular properties, and climate benchmarks show CANUF reduces Expected Calibration Error by 34.7% versus Bayesian neural networks while maintaining 99.2% constraint satisfaction. Ablations reveal constraint-guided recalibration contributes 18.3% performance gain, with constraint extraction achieving 91.4% precision. CANUF provides the first end-to-end differentiable pipeline simultaneously addressing uncertainty quantification, constraint satisfaction, and interpretable explanations for scientific predictions.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Defense in Vision-Language Models: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of Vision Language Models (VLMs, e.g. CLIP) has raised concerns about their vulnerability to sophisticated and imperceptible adversarial attacks. These attacks could compromise model performance and system security in cross-modal tasks. To address this challenge, three main defense paradigms have been proposed: Training-time Defense, Test-time Adaptation Defense, and Training-free Defense. Training-time Defense involves modifying the training process, typically through adversarial fine-tuning to improve the robustness to adversarial examples. While effective, this approach requires substantial computational resources and may not generalize across all adversarial attacks. Test-time Adaptation Defense focuses on adapting the model at inference time by updating its parameters to handle unlabeled adversarial examples, offering flexibility but often at the cost of increased complexity and computational overhead. Training-free Defense avoids modifying the model itself, instead focusing on altering the adversarial inputs or their feature embeddings, which enforces input perturbations to mitigate the impact of attacks without additional training. This survey reviews the latest advancements in adversarial defense strategies for VLMs, highlighting the strengths and limitations of such approaches and discussing ongoing challenges in enhancing the robustness of VLMs.</description>

      <title>AgenTRIM: Tool Risk Mitigation for Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents are autonomous systems that combine LLMs with external tools to solve complex tasks. While such tools extend capability, improper tool permissions introduce security risks such as indirect prompt injection and tool misuse. We characterize these failures as unbalanced tool-driven agency. Agents may retain unnecessary permissions (excessive agency) or fail to invoke required tools (insufficient agency), amplifying the attack surface and reducing performance. We introduce AgenTRIM, a framework for detecting and mitigating tool-driven agency risks without altering an agent's internal reasoning. AgenTRIM addresses these risks through complementary offline and online phases. Offline, AgenTRIM reconstructs and verifies the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces. At runtime, it enforces per-step least-privilege tool access through adaptive filtering and status-aware validation of tool calls. Evaluating on the AgentDojo benchmark, AgenTRIM substantially reduces attack success while maintaining high task performance. Additional experiments show robustness to description-based attacks and effective enforcement of explicit safety policies. Together, these results demonstrate that AgenTRIM provides a practical, capability-preserving approach to safer tool use in LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing In-depth Reasoning over Long Contexts with Process Advantage Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in enhancing LLMs short-context reasoning, but its performance degrades in long-context scenarios that require both precise grounding and robust long-range reasoning. We identify the "almost-there" phenomenon in long-context reasoning, where trajectories are largely correct but fail at the final step, and attribute this failure to two factors: (1) the lack of high reasoning density in long-context QA data that push LLMs beyond mere grounding toward sophisticated multi-hop reasoning; and (2) the loss of valuable learning signals during long-context RL training due to the indiscriminate penalization of partially correct trajectories with incorrect outcomes. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose DeepReasonQA, a KG-driven synthesis framework that controllably constructs high-difficulty, multi-hop long-context QA pairs with inherent reasoning chains. Building on this, we introduce Long-context Process Advantage Shaping (LongPAS), a simple yet effective method that performs fine-grained credit assignment by evaluating reasoning steps along Validity and Relevance dimensions, which captures critical learning signals from "almost-there" trajectories. Experiments on three long-context reasoning benchmarks show that our approach substantially outperforms RLVR baselines and matches frontier LLMs while using far fewer parameters. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our methods in strengthening long-context reasoning while maintaining stable RL training.</description>

      <title>Patch-Level Tokenization with CNN Encoders and Attention for Improved Transformer Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown strong performance in time-series forecasting by leveraging self-attention to model long-range temporal dependencies. However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines. The results highlight the importance of structured temporal representations and show that decoupling local temporal encoding from global attention-based modelling yields more effective and stable time-series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Knowing When to Abstain: Medical LLMs Under Clinical Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current evaluation of large language models (LLMs) overwhelmingly prioritizes accuracy; however, in real-world and safety-critical applications, the ability to abstain when uncertain is equally vital for trustworthy deployment. We introduce MedAbstain, a unified benchmark and evaluation protocol for abstention in medical multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) -- a discrete-choice setting that generalizes to agentic action selection -- integrating conformal prediction, adversarial question perturbations, and explicit abstention options. Our systematic evaluation of both open- and closed-source LLMs reveals that even state-of-the-art, high-accuracy models often fail to abstain with uncertain. Notably, providing explicit abstention options consistently increases model uncertainty and safer abstention, far more than input perturbations, while scaling model size or advanced prompting brings little improvement. These findings highlight the central role of abstention mechanisms for trustworthy LLM deployment and offer practical guidance for improving safety in high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing the Arabic Audio Space with Data Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio large language models (LLMs) enable unified speech understanding and generation, yet their adaptation to linguistically complex, dialect-rich settings remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of multi-task instruction tuning for an Arabic-centric audio LLM, covering a hierarchy of generative tasks (ASR, speech summarization) and discriminative tasks (dialect and emotion identification). To support this study, we introduce AraMega-SSum, a novel dataset for Arabic speech summarization. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Omni (7B) and propose Task-Progressive Curriculum (TPC) along with Aligner-Based Diverse Sampling (ADS), a strategy that constructs information-dense batches by selecting task- and label-balanced examples. Our results reveal a critical efficiency, robustness trade-off: while ADS accelerates initial convergence and boosts paralinguistic F1-scores, its inherent gradient volatility can destabilize generative decoding under prolonged training. Furthermore, while the TPC stabilizes core acoustic mapping, it often induces negative transfer in downstream tasks. We demonstrate that a Hybrid TPC+ADS Strategy provides an optimal training ``recipe'', first establishing a robust representative foundation before employing diversity-aware refinement to capture fine-grained nuances. These findings offer practical guidance for the efficient adaptation of Omni-models in complex, low-resource multimodal environments.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Multi-agent RL with Communication Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative MARL often assumes frequent access to global information in a data buffer, such as team rewards or other agents' actions, which is typically unrealistic in decentralized MARL systems due to high communication costs. When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\max_i |A_i|)\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum. Empirically, we test the base policy prediction algorithm in both simulated games and MAPPO for complex environments.</description>

      <title>Improved Bug Localization with AI Agents Leveraging Hypothesis and Dynamic Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software bugs cost technology providers (e.g., AT&amp;T) billions annually and cause developers to spend roughly 50% of their time on bug resolution. Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between emotional expression and eye movement is well-documented, with literature establishing gaze patterns are reliable indicators of emotion. However, most studies utilize specialized, high-resolution eye-tracking equipment, limiting the potential reach of findings. We investigate how eye movement can be used to predict multimodal markers of emotional expression from naturalistic, low-resolution videos. We utilize a collection of video interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive with Holocaust survivors as they recount their experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Inspired by pretraining methods on language models, we develop a novel gaze detection model that uses self-supervised eye movement reconstruction that can effectively leverage unlabeled video. We use this model's encoder embeddings to fine-tune models on two downstream tasks related to emotional expression. The first is aligning eye movement with directional emotion estimates from speech. The second task is using eye gaze as a predictor of three momentary manifestations of emotional behaviors: laughing, crying/sobbing, and sighing. We find our new model is predictive of emotion outcomes and observe a positive correlation between pretraining performance and emotion processing performance for both experiments. We conclude self-supervised eye movement reconstruction is an effective method for encoding the affective signal they carry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) has gained increasing attention as parallel data from low-resource language communities is collected, but many potential methods for improving low-resource MT remain unexplored. We investigate a self-supervised reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning for translation in low-resource settings using round-trip bootstrapping with the No Language Left Behind (NLLB) family of models. Our approach translates English into a target low-resource language and then back into English, using a combination of chrF++ and BLEU as the reward function on the reconstructed English sentences. Using the NLLB-MD dataset, we evaluate both the 600M and 1.3B parameter NLLB models and observe consistent improvements for the following languages: Central Aymara, Friulian, Wolof and Russian. Qualitative inspection of translation outputs indicates increased fluency and semantic fidelity. We argue that our method can further benefit from scale, enabling models to increasingly leverage their pretrained knowledge and continue self-improving.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Concept-Spilling Across Languages in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable cross-lingual abilities, yet often exhibit a systematic bias toward the representations from other languages, resulting in semantic interference when generating content in non-English languages$-$a phenomenon we define as language spilling. This paper presents a novel comparative framework for evaluating multilingual semantic robustness by systematically measuring how models handle polysemous words across languages. Our methodology provides a relative measure of model performance: when required to generate exactly five meanings, both strong and weak models may resort to meanings from dominant languages, but semantically stronger models do so later in the generation sequence, producing more true meanings from the target language before failing, while weaker models resort to dominant-language meanings earlier in the sequence. We evaluate a diverse set of open and closed multilingual LLMs using a structured meaning generation task across nine languages, employing a carefully curated benchmark of 100 high-polysemy English words. Our findings reveal significant variation in semantic robustness across both models and languages, providing a principled ranking system for model comparison without requiring definitive causal attribution of error sources. We contribute both a scalable comparative benchmark for multilingual semantic evaluation and a rigorous validation pipeline$-$critical tools for developing more linguistically balanced AI systems.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming materials science and engineering, offering powerful tools to navigate complexity, accelerate discovery, and optimize material design in ways previously unattainable. Driven by the accelerating pace of algorithmic advancements and increasing data availability, AI is becoming an essential competency for materials researchers. This review provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the current landscape, synthesizing recent advancements and methodologies for materials scientists seeking to effectively leverage these data-driven techniques. We survey the spectrum of machine learning approaches, from traditional algorithms to advanced deep learning architectures, including CNNs, GNNs, and Transformers, alongside emerging generative AI and probabilistic models such as Gaussian Processes for uncertainty quantification. The review also examines the pivotal role of data in this field, emphasizing how effective representation and featurization strategies, spanning compositional, structural, image-based, and language-inspired approaches, combined with appropriate preprocessing, fundamentally underpin the performance of machine learning models in materials research. Persistent challenges related to data quality, quantity, and standardization, which critically impact model development and application in materials science and engineering, are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Life, Machine Learning, and the Search for Habitability: Predicting Biosignature Fluxes for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future direct-imaging flagship missions, such as NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), face critical decisions in prioritizing observations due to extremely stringent time and resource constraints. In this paper, we introduce two advanced machine-learning architectures tailored for predicting biosignature species fluxes from exoplanetary reflected-light spectra: a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) and our novel model architecture, the Spectral Query Adaptive Transformer (SQuAT). The BCNN robustly quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, offering reliable predictions under diverse observational conditions, whereas SQuAT employs query-driven attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability by explicitly associating spectral features with specific biosignature species. We demonstrate that both models achieve comparably high predictive accuracy on an augmented dataset spanning a wide range of exoplanetary conditions, while highlighting their distinct advantages in uncertainty quantification and spectral interpretability. These capabilities position our methods as promising tools for accelerating target triage, optimizing observation schedules, and maximizing scientific return for upcoming flagship missions such as HWO.</description>

      <title>Primate-like perceptual decision making emerges through deep recurrent reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress has led to a detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie decision making in primates. However, less is known about why such mechanisms are present in the first place. Theory suggests that primate decision making mechanisms, and their resultant behavioral abilities, emerged to maximize reward in the face of noisy, temporally evolving information. To test this theory, we trained an end-to-end deep recurrent neural network using reinforcement learning on a noisy perceptual discrimination task. Networks learned several key abilities of primate-like decision making including trading off speed for accuracy, and flexibly changing their mind in the face of new information. Internal dynamics of these networks suggest that these abilities were supported by similar decision mechanisms as those observed in primate neurophysiological studies. These results provide experimental support for key pressures that gave rise to the primate ability to make flexible decisions.</description>

      <title>Ontology-aligned structuring and reuse of multimodal materials data and workflows towards automatic reproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducibility of computational results remains a challenge in materials science, as simulation workflows and parameters are often reported only in unstructured text and tables. While literature data are valuable for validation and reuse, the lack of machine-readable workflow descriptions prevents large-scale curation and systematic comparison. Existing text-mining approaches are insufficient to extract complete computational workflows with their associated parameters. An ontology-driven, large language model (LLM)-assisted framework is introduced for the automated extraction and structuring of computational workflows from the literature. The approach focuses on density functional theory-based stacking fault energy (SFE) calculations in hexagonal close-packed magnesium and its binary alloys, and uses a multi-stage filtering strategy together with prompt-engineered LLM extraction applied to method sections and tables. Extracted information is unified into a canonical schema and aligned with established materials ontologies (CMSO, ASMO, and PLDO), enabling the construction of a knowledge graph using atomRDF. The resulting knowledge graph enables systematic comparison of reported SFE values and supports the structured reuse of computational protocols. While full computational reproducibility is still constrained by missing or implicit metadata, the framework provides a foundation for organizing and contextualizing published results in a semantically interoperable form, thereby improving transparency and reusability of computational materials data.</description>

      <title>Do MLLMs See What We See? Analyzing Visualization Literacy Barriers in AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to interpret visualizations, yet little is known about why they fail. We present the first systematic analysis of barriers to visualization literacy in MLLMs. Using the regenerated Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (reVLAT) benchmark with synthetic data, we open-coded 309 erroneous responses from four state-of-the-art models with a barrier-centric strategy adapted from human visualization literacy research. Our analysis yields a taxonomy of MLLM failures, revealing two machine-specific barriers that extend prior human-participation frameworks. Results show that models perform well on simple charts but struggle with color-intensive, segment-based visualizations, often failing to form consistent comparative reasoning. Our findings inform future evaluation and design of reliable AI-driven visualization assistants.</description>

      <title>SLAP: Scalable Language-Audio Pretraining with Variable-Duration Audio and Multi-Objective Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) has achieved notable success in learning semantically rich audio representations and is widely adopted for various audio-related tasks. However, current CLAP models face several key limitations. First, they are typically trained on relatively small datasets, often comprising a few million audio samples. Second, existing CLAP models are restricted to short and fixed duration, which constrains their usage in real-world scenarios with variable-duration audio. Third, the standard contrastive training objective operates on global representations, which may hinder the learning of dense, fine-grained audio features. To address these challenges, we introduce Scalable Language-Audio Pretraining (SLAP), which scales language-audio pretraining to 109 million audio-text pairs with variable audio durations and incorporates multiple training objectives. SLAP unifies contrastive loss with additional self-supervised and captioning losses in a single-stage training, facilitating the learning of richer dense audio representations. The proposed SLAP model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on audio-text retrieval and zero-shot audio classification tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Cloud-based Multi-Agentic Workflow for Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become ubiquitous across various scientific domains, their lack of ability to perform complex tasks like running simulations or to make complex decisions limits their utility. LLM-based agents bridge this gap due to their ability to call external resources and tools and thus are now rapidly gaining popularity. However, coming up with a workflow that can balance the models, cloud providers, and external resources is very challenging, making implementing an agentic system more of a hindrance than a help. In this work, we present a domain-agnostic, model-independent workflow for an agentic framework that can act as a scientific assistant while being run entirely on cloud. Built with a supervisor agent marshaling an array of agents with individual capabilities, our framework brings together straightforward tasks like literature review and data analysis with more complex ones like simulation runs. We describe the framework here in full, including a proof-of-concept system we built to accelerate the study of Catalysts, which is highly important in the field of Chemistry and Material Science. We report the cost to operate and use this framework, including the breakdown of the cost by services use. We also evaluate our system on a custom-curated synthetic benchmark and a popular Chemistry benchmark, and also perform expert validation of the system. The results show that our system is able to route the task to the correct agent 90% of the time and successfully complete the assigned task 97.5% of the time for the synthetic tasks and 91% of the time for real-world tasks, while still achieving better or comparable accuracy to most frontier models, showing that this is a viable framework for other scientific domains to replicate.</description>

      <title>Creating Disability Story Videos with Generative AI: Motivation, Expression, and Sharing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is both promising and challenging in supporting people with disabilities (PwDs) in creating stories about disability. GenAI can reduce barriers to media production and inspire the creativity of PwDs, but it may also introduce biases and imperfections that hinder its adoption for personal expression. In this research, we examine how nine PwD from a disability advocacy group used GenAI to create videos sharing their disability experiences. Grounded in digital storytelling theory, we explore the motivations, expression, and sharing of PwD-created GenAI story videos. We conclude with a framework of momentous depiction, which highlights four core affordances of GenAI that either facilitate or require improvements to better support disability storytelling: non-capturable depiction, identity concealment and representation, contextual realism and consistency, and emotional articulation. Based on this framework, we further discuss design implications for GenAI in relation to story completion, media formats, and corrective mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Multiscale Mixture of Experts for Efficient Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many molecular properties depend on 3D geometry, where non-covalent interactions, stereochemical effects, and medium- to long-range forces are determined by spatial distances and angles that cannot be uniquely captured by a 2D bond graph. Yet most 3D molecular graph neural networks still rely on globally fixed neighborhood heuristics, typically defined by distance cutoffs and maximum neighbor limits, to define local message-passing neighborhoods, leading to rigid, data-agnostic interaction budgets. We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks. These results highlight topology-aware multiscale routing as an effective principle for 3D molecular graph learning.</description>

      <title>Mixed Precision PointPillars for Efficient 3D Object Detection with TensorRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LIDAR 3D object detection is one of the important tasks for autonomous vehicles. Ensuring that this task operates in real-time is crucial. Toward this, model quantization can be used to accelerate the runtime. However, directly applying model quantization often leads to performance degradation due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and extreme outliers. To address the wide numerical distribution, we proposed a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars. Our framework first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization (PTQ) by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance. Our methods provides mixed precision models without training in the PTQ pipeline, while our QAT pipeline achieves the performance competitive to FP models. With TensorRT deployment, our models offer less latency and sizes by up to 2.35 and 2.26 times, respectively.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Harms, Bounded Law: Liability in the Age of Borderless AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) has exposed significant deficiencies in risk governance. While ex-ante harm identification and prevention have advanced, Responsible AI scholarship remains underdeveloped in addressing ex-post liability. Core legal questions regarding liability allocation, responsibility attribution, and remedial effectiveness remain insufficiently theorized and institutionalized, particularly for transboundary harms and risks that transcend national jurisdictions. Drawing on contemporary AI risk analyses, we argue that such harms are structurally embedded in global AI supply chains and are likely to escalate in frequency and severity due to cross-border deployment, data infrastructures, and uneven national oversight capacities. Consequently, territorially bounded liability regimes are increasingly inadequate. Using a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, this paper examines compensation and liability frameworks from high-risk transnational domains - including vaccine injury schemes, systemic financial risk governance, commercial nuclear liability, and international environmental regimes - to distill transferable legal design principles such as strict liability, risk pooling, collective risk-sharing, and liability channelling, while highlighting potential structural constraints on their application to AI-related harms. Situated within an international order shaped more by AI arms race dynamics than cooperative governance, the paper outlines the contours of a global AI accountability and compensation architecture, emphasizing the tension between geopolitical rivalry and the collective action required to govern transboundary AI risks effectively.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Documentation in Medical Education: Can AI Replace Manual Case Logging?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Procedural case logs are a core requirement in radiology training, yet they are time-consuming to complete and prone to inconsistency when authored manually. This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can automate procedural case log documentation directly from free-text radiology reports. We evaluate multiple local and commercial LLMs under instruction-based and chain-of-thought prompting to extract structured procedural information from 414 curated interventional radiology reports authored by nine residents between 2018 and 2024. Model performance is assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score, alongside inference latency and token efficiency to estimate operational cost. Results show that both local and commercial models achieve strong extraction performance, with best F1-scores approaching 0.87, while exhibiting different trade-offs between speed and cost. Automation using LLMs has the potential to substantially reduce clerical burden for trainees and improve consistency in case logging. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of AI-assisted documentation in medical education and highlight the need for further validation across institutions and clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Explanation Multiplicity in SHAP: Characterization and Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-hoc explanations are widely used to justify, contest, and audit automated decisions in high-stakes domains. SHAP, in particular, is often treated as a reliable account of which features drove an individual prediction. Yet SHAP explanations can vary substantially across repeated runs even when the input, task, and trained model are held fixed. We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features. To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models. Across datasets, model classes, and confidence regimes, we find explanation multiplicity is pervasive and persists even for high-confidence predictions, highlighting the need for metrics and baselines that match the intended use of explanations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the quality of responses in Question-Answering (QA) tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with retrieving contextually relevant information, leading to incomplete or suboptimal answers. In this paper, we introduce Structured-Semantic RAG (SSRAG), a hybrid architecture that enhances QA quality by integrating query augmentation, agentic routing, and a structured retrieval mechanism combining vector and graph based techniques with context unification. By refining retrieval processes and improving contextual grounding, our approach improves both answer accuracy and informativeness. We conduct extensive evaluations on three popular QA datasets, TruthfulQA, SQuAD and WikiQA, across five Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that our proposed approach consistently improves response quality over standard RAG implementations.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Hyperparameter Optimization for Federated Learning on Non-IID Cancer Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning for cancer histopathology training conflicts with privacy constraints in clinical settings. Federated Learning (FL) mitigates this by keeping data local; however, its performance depends on hyperparameter choices under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) client datasets. This paper examined whether hyperparameters optimized on one cancer imaging dataset generalized across non-IID federated scenarios. We considered binary histopathology tasks for ovarian and colorectal cancers. We perform centralized Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and transfer dataset-specific optima to the non-IID FL setup. The main contribution of this study is the introduction of a simple cross-dataset aggregation heuristic by combining configurations by averaging the learning rates and considering the modal optimizers and batch sizes. This combined configuration achieves a competitive classification performance.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Test-Time Augmentation in Federated Learning for Brain Tumor MRI Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient brain tumor diagnosis is crucial for early treatment; however, it is challenging because of lesion variability and image complexity. We evaluated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a federated learning (FL) setting, comparing models trained on original versus preprocessed MRI images (resizing, grayscale conversion, normalization, filtering, and histogram equalization). Preprocessing alone yielded negligible gains; combined with test-time augmentation (TTA), it delivered consistent, statistically significant improvements in federated MRI classification (p&lt;0.001). In practice, TTA should be the default inference strategy in FL-based medical imaging; when the computational budget permits, pairing TTA with light preprocessing provides additional reliable gains.</description>

      <title>RSOD: Reliability-Guided Sonar Image Object Detection with Extremely Limited Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection in sonar images is a key technology in underwater detection systems. Compared to natural images, sonar images contain fewer texture details and are more susceptible to noise, making it difficult for non-experts to distinguish subtle differences between classes. This leads to their inability to provide precise annotation data for sonar images. Therefore, designing effective object detection methods for sonar images with extremely limited labels is particularly important. To address this, we propose a teacher-student framework called RSOD, which aims to fully learn the characteristics of sonar images and develop a pseudo-label strategy suitable for these images to mitigate the impact of limited labels. First, RSOD calculates a reliability score by assessing the consistency of the teacher's predictions across different views. To leverage this score, we introduce an object mixed pseudo-label method to tackle the shortage of labeled data in sonar images. Finally, we optimize the performance of the student by implementing a reliability-guided adaptive constraint. By taking full advantage of unlabeled data, the student can perform well even in situations with extremely limited labels. Notably, on the UATD dataset, our method, using only 5% of labeled data, achieves results that can compete against those of our baseline algorithm trained on 100% labeled data. We also collected a new dataset to provide more valuable data for research in the field of sonar.</description>

      <title>An Evolutionary Framework for Automatic Optimization Benchmark Generation via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization benchmarks play a fundamental role in assessing algorithm performance; however, existing artificial benchmarks often fail to capture the diversity and irregularity of real-world problem structures, while benchmarks derived from real-world problems are costly and difficult to construct. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary automatic benchmark generation framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a generative operator, termed the LLM-driven evolutionary benchmark generator (LLM-EBG). In this framework, the LLM serves as an evolutionary operator that generates and evolves benchmark problems within a flexible, expressive representation space. As a case study, we generate unconstrained single-objective continuous minimization problems represented as mathematical expressions designed to induce significant performance differences between a genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE). Experimental results show that LLM-EBG successfully produces benchmark problems in which the designated target algorithm consistently outperforms the comparative algorithm in more than 80\% of trials. Furthermore, exploratory landscape analysis reveals that benchmarks favoring GA are highly sensitive to variable scaling, demonstrating that the proposed framework can generate problems with distinct geometric characteristics that reflect the intrinsic search behaviors of different optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>AI-exhibited Personality Traits Can Shape Human Self-concept through Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM) based AI can exhibit recognizable and measurable personality traits during conversations to improve user experience. However, as human understandings of their personality traits can be affected by their interaction partners' traits, a potential risk is that AI traits may shape and bias users' self-concept of their own traits. To explore the possibility, we conducted a randomized behavioral experiment. Our results indicate that after conversations about personal topics with an LLM-based AI chatbot using GPT-4o default personality traits, users' self-concepts aligned with the AI's measured personality traits. The longer the conversation, the greater the alignment. This alignment led to increased homogeneity in self-concepts among users. We also observed that the degree of self-concept alignment was positively associated with users' conversation enjoyment. Our findings uncover how AI personality traits can shape users' self-concepts through human-AI conversation, highlighting both risks and opportunities. We provide important design implications for developing more responsible and ethical AI systems.</description>

      <title>A Shared Geometry of Difficulty in Multilingual Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting problem-difficulty in large language models (LLMs) refers to estimating how difficult a task is according to the model itself, typically by training linear probes on its internal representations. In this work, we study the multilingual geometry of problem-difficulty in LLMs by training linear probes using the AMC subset of the Easy2Hard benchmark, translated into 21 languages. We found that difficulty-related signals emerge at two distinct stages of the model internals, corresponding to shallow (early-layers) and deep (later-layers) internal representations, that exhibit functionally different behaviors. Probes trained on deep representations achieve high accuracy when evaluated on the same language but exhibit poor cross-lingual generalization. In contrast, probes trained on shallow representations generalize substantially better across languages, despite achieving lower within-language performance. Together, these results suggest that LLMs first form a language-agnostic representation of problem difficulty, which subsequently becomes language-specific. This closely aligns with existing findings in LLM interpretability showing that models tend to operate in an abstract conceptual space before producing language-specific outputs. We demonstrate that this two-stage representational process extends beyond semantic content to high-level meta-cognitive properties such as problem-difficulty estimation.</description>

      <title>TreeWriter: AI-Assisted Hierarchical Planning and Writing for Long-Form Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long documents pose many challenges to current intelligent writing systems. These include maintaining consistency across sections, sustaining efficient planning and writing as documents become more complex, and effectively providing and integrating AI assistance to the user. Existing AI co-writing tools offer either inline suggestions or limited structured planning, but rarely support the entire writing process that begins with high-level ideas and ends with polished prose, in which many layers of planning and outlining are needed. Here, we introduce TreeWriter, a hierarchical writing system that represents documents as trees and integrates contextual AI support. TreeWriter allows authors to create, save, and refine document outlines at multiple levels, facilitating drafting, understanding, and iterative editing of long documents. A built-in AI agent can dynamically load relevant content, navigate the document hierarchy, and provide context-aware editing suggestions. A within-subject study (N=12) comparing TreeWriter with Google Docs + Gemini on long-document editing and creative writing tasks shows that TreeWriter improves idea exploration/development, AI helpfulness, and perceived authorial control. A two-month field deployment (N=8) further demonstrated that hierarchical organization supports collaborative writing. Our findings highlight the potential of hierarchical, tree-structured editors with integrated AI support and provide design guidelines for future AI-assisted writing tools that balance automation with user agency.</description>

      <title>AirHunt: Bridging VLM Semantics and Continuous Planning for Efficient Aerial Object Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have provided rich semantic understanding that empowers drones to search for open-set objects via natural language instructions. However, prior systems struggle to integrate VLMs into practical aerial systems due to orders-of-magnitude frequency mismatch between VLM inference and real-time planning, as well as VLMs' limited 3D scene understanding. They also lack a unified mechanism to balance semantic guidance with motion efficiency in large-scale environments. To address these challenges, we present AirHunt, an aerial object navigation system that efficiently locates open-set objects with zero-shot generalization in outdoor environments by seamlessly fusing VLM semantic reasoning with continuous path planning. AirHunt features a dual-pathway asynchronous architecture that establishes a synergistic interface between VLM reasoning and path planning, enabling continuous flight with adaptive semantic guidance that evolves through motion. Moreover, we propose an active dual-task reasoning module that exploits geometric and semantic redundancy to enable selective VLM querying, and a semantic-geometric coherent planning module that dynamically reconciles semantic priorities and motion efficiency in a unified framework, enabling seamless adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. We evaluate AirHunt across diverse object navigation tasks and environments, demonstrating a higher success rate with lower navigation error and reduced flight time compared to state-of-the-art methods. Real-world experiments further validate AirHunt's practical capability in complex and challenging environments. Code and dataset will be made publicly available before publication.</description>

      <title>A Graph Prompt Fine-Tuning Method for WSN Spatio-Temporal Correlation Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection of multi-temporal modal data in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can provide an important guarantee for reliable network operation. Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</description>

      <title>PAIR-SAFE: A Paired-Agent Approach for Runtime Auditing and Refining AI-Mediated Mental Health Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for mental health support, yet they can produce responses that are overly directive, inconsistent, or clinically misaligned, particularly in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Existing approaches to mitigating these risks largely rely on implicit alignment through training or prompting, offering limited transparency and runtime accountability. We introduce PAIR-SAFE, a paired-agent framework for auditing and refining AI-generated mental health support that integrates a Responder agent with a supervisory Judge agent grounded in the clinically validated Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI-4) framework. The Judgeaudits each response and provides structuredALLOW or REVISE decisions that guide runtime response refinement. We simulate counseling interactions using a support-seeker simulator derived from human-annotated motivational interviewing data. We find that Judge-supervised interactions show significant improvements in key MITI dimensions, including Partnership, Seek Collaboration, and overall Relational quality. Our quantitative findings are supported by qualitative expert evaluation, which further highlights the nuances of runtime supervision. Together, our results reveal that such pairedagent approach can provide clinically grounded auditing and refinement for AI-assisted conversational mental health support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, it is essential that their outputs reflect not average} human preference, rather range of varying perspectives. Achieving such pluralism, however, remains challenging. Existing approaches consider limited values or rely on prompt-level interventions, lacking value control and representation. To address this, we introduce VISPA, a training-free pluralistic alignment framework, that enables direct control over value expression by dynamic selection and internal model activation steering. Across extensive empirical studies spanning multiple models and evaluation settings, we show VISPA is performant across all pluralistic alignment modes in healthcare and beyond. Further analysis reveals VISPA is adaptable with different steering initiations, model, and/or values. These results suggest that pluralistic alignment can be achieved through internal activation mechanisms, offering a scalable path toward language models that serves all.</description>

      <title>Teaching LLMs to Learn Tool Trialing and Execution through Environment Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to solve complex real-world problems. However, the robustness of existing methods remains a critical challenge when confronting novel or evolving tools. Existing trajectory-centric paradigms primarily rely on memorizing static solution paths during training, which limits the ability of LLMs to generalize tool usage to newly introduced or previously unseen tools. In this paper, we propose ToolMaster, a framework that shifts tool use from imitating golden tool-calling trajectories to actively learning tool usage through interaction with the environment. To optimize LLMs for tool planning and invocation, ToolMaster adopts a trial-and-execution paradigm, which trains LLMs to first imitate teacher-generated trajectories containing explicit tool trials and self-correction, followed by reinforcement learning to coordinate the trial and execution phases jointly. This process enables agents to autonomously explore correct tool usage by actively interacting with environments and forming experiential knowledge that benefits tool execution. Experimental results demonstrate that ToolMaster significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of generalization and robustness across unseen or unfamiliar tools.

      <title>Distilling Time Series Foundation Models for Efficient Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Series foundation models (TSFMs) deliver strong forecasting performance through large-scale pretraining, but their large parameter sizes make deployment costly. While knowledge distillation offers a natural and effective approach for model compression, techniques developed for general machine learning tasks are not directly applicable to time series forecasting due to the unique characteristics. To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x. Code is available at: https://github.com/itsnotacie/DistilTS-ICASSP2026.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown growing promise in biomedical research, particularly for knowledge-driven interpretation tasks. However, their ability to reliably reason from gene-level knowledge to functional understanding, However, their ability to reliably reason from gene-level knowledge to functional understanding, a core requirement for knowledge-enhanced cell atlas interpretation, remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce SciHorizon-GENE, a large-scale gene-centric benchmark constructed from authoritative biological databases. The benchmark integrates curated knowledge for over 190K human genes and comprises more than 540K questions covering diverse gene-to-function reasoning scenarios relevant to cell type annotation, functional interpretation, and mechanism-oriented analysis. Motivated by behavioral patterns observed in preliminary examinations, SciHorizon-GENE evaluates LLMs along four biologically critical perspectives: research attention sensitivity, hallucination tendency, answer completeness, and literature influence, explicitly targeting failure modes that limit the safe adoption of LLMs in biological interpretation pipelines. We systematically evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art general-purpose and biomedical LLMs, revealing substantial heterogeneity in gene-level reasoning capabilities and persistent challenges in generating faithful, complete, and literature-grounded functional interpretations. Our benchmark establishes a systematic foundation for analyzing LLM behavior at the gene scale and offers insights for model selection and development, with direct relevance to knowledge-enhanced biological interpretation.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Symmetry Breaking in CLIP-style Vision-Language Models Trained on Synthetic Spatial-Relation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a key challenge in vision-language models. Yet it is still unclear whether such understanding is truly acquired, and if so, through what mechanisms. We present a controllable 1D image-text testbed to probe how left-right relational understanding emerges in Transformer-based vision and text encoders trained with a CLIP-style contrastive objective. We train lightweight Transformer-based vision and text encoders end-to-end on paired descriptions of one- and two-object scenes and evaluate generalization to unseen object pairs while systematically varying label and layout diversity. We find that contrastive training learns left-right relations and that label diversity, more than layout diversity, is the primary driver of generalization in this setting. To gain the mechanistic understanding, we perform an attention decomposition and show that interactions between positional and token embeddings induce a horizontal attention gradient that breaks left-right symmetry in the encoders; ablating this contribution substantially reduces left-right discrimination. Our results provide a mechanistic insight of when and how CLIP-style models acquire relational competence.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Orthogonal Projected Natural Gradient Descent for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge on sequential tasks. However, the key challenge in such settings is to learn new tasks without catastrophically forgetting previously learned tasks. We propose the Fisher-Orthogonal Projected Natural Gradient Descent (FOPNG) optimizer, which enforces Fisher-orthogonal constraints on parameter updates to preserve old task performance while learning new tasks. Unlike existing methods that operate in Euclidean parameter space, FOPNG projects gradients onto the Fisher-orthogonal complement of previous task gradients. This approach unifies natural gradient descent with orthogonal gradient methods within an information-geometric framework. The resulting update direction is invariant under reparameterization, guarantees descent in the Fisher metric, and helps preserve prior task outputs. We provide theoretical analysis establishing the properties of the projected update, describe efficient and practical implementations using the diagonal Fisher, and demonstrate strong results on standard continual learning benchmarks such as Permuted-MNIST, Split-MNIST, Rotated-MNIST, Split-CIFAR10, and Split-CIFAR100.</description>

      <title>Cognition spaces: natural, artificial, and hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive processes are realized across an extraordinary range of natural, artificial, and hybrid systems, yet there is no unified framework for comparing their forms, limits, and unrealized possibilities. Here, we propose a cognition space approach that replaces narrow, substrate-dependent definitions with a comparative representation based on organizational and informational dimensions. Within this framework, cognition is treated as a graded capacity to sense, process, and act upon information, allowing systems as diverse as cells, brains, artificial agents, and human-AI collectives to be analyzed within a common conceptual landscape. We introduce and examine three cognition spaces -- basal aneural, neural, and human-AI hybrid -- and show that their occupation is highly uneven, with clusters of realized systems separated by large unoccupied regions. We argue that these voids are not accidental but reflect evolutionary contingencies, physical constraints, and design limitations. By focusing on the structure of cognition spaces rather than on categorical definitions, this approach clarifies the diversity of existing cognitive systems and highlights hybrid cognition as a promising frontier for exploring novel forms of complexity beyond those produced by biological evolution.</description>

      <title>The Cost of EFX: Generalized-Mean Welfare and Complexity Dichotomies with Few Surplus Items</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is a central fairness notion for allocating indivisible goods, yet its existence is unresolved in general. In the setting with few surplus items, where the number of goods exceeds the number of agents by a small constant (at most three), EFX allocations are guaranteed to exist, shifting the focus from existence to efficiency and computation. We study how EFX interacts with generalized-mean ($p$-mean) welfare, which subsumes commonly-studied utilitarian ($p=1$), Nash ($p=0$), and egalitarian ($p \rightarrow -\infty$) objectives. We establish sharp complexity dichotomies at $p=0$: for any fixed $p \in (0,1]$, both deciding whether EFX can attain the global $p$-mean optimum and computing an EFX allocation maximizing $p$-mean welfare are NP-hard, even with at most three surplus goods; in contrast, for any fixed $p \leq 0$, we give polynomial-time algorithms that optimize $p$-mean welfare within the space of EFX allocations and efficiently certify when EFX attains the global optimum. We further quantify the welfare loss of enforcing EFX via the price of fairness framework, showing that for $p &gt; 0$, the loss can grow linearly with the number of agents, whereas for $p \leq 0$, it is bounded by a constant depending on the surplus (and for Nash welfare it vanishes asymptotically). Finally we show that requiring Pareto-optimality alongside EFX is NP-hard (and becomes $\Sigma_2^P$-complete for a stronger variant of EFX). Overall, our results delineate when EFX is computationally costly versus structurally aligned with welfare maximization in the setting with few surplus items.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Sparse Circuit Extraction from Billion-Parameter Language Models through Scalable Attribution Graph Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to reverse-engineer neural network computations into human-understandable algorithms, yet extracting sparse computational circuits from billion-parameter language models remains challenging due to exponential search complexity and pervasive polysemanticity. The proposed Hierarchical Attribution Graph Decomposition (HAGD) framework reduces circuit discovery complexity from O(2^n) exhaustive enumeration to O(n^2 log n) through multi-resolution abstraction hierarchies and differentiable circuit search. The methodology integrates cross-layer transcoders for monosemantic feature extraction, graph neural network meta-learning for topology prediction, and causal intervention protocols for validation. Empirical evaluation spans GPT-2 variants, Llama-7B through Llama-70B, and Pythia suite models across algorithmic tasks and natural language benchmarks. On modular arithmetic tasks, the framework achieves up to 91% behavioral preservation ($\pm$2.3\% across runs) while maintaining interpretable subgraph sizes. Cross-architecture transfer experiments suggest that discovered circuits exhibit moderate structural similarity (averaging 67%) across model families, indicating potential shared computational patterns. These results provide preliminary foundations for interpretability at larger model scales while identifying significant limitations in current attribution methodologies that require future advances.</description>

      <title>YOLO26: An Analysis of NMS-Free End to End Framework for Real-Time Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) framework has long served as the benchmark for real-time object detection, yet traditional iterations (YOLOv1 through YOLO11) remain constrained by the latency and hyperparameter sensitivity of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-processing. This paper analyzes a comprehensive analysis of YOLO26, an architecture that fundamentally redefines this paradigm by eliminating NMS in favor of a native end-to-end learning strategy. This study examines the critical innovations that enable this transition, specifically the introduction of the MuSGD optimizer for stabilizing lightweight backbones, STAL for small-target-aware assignment, and ProgLoss for dynamic supervision. Through a systematic review of official performance benchmarks, the results demonstrate that YOLO26 establishes a new Pareto front, outperforming a comprehensive suite of predecessors and state-of-the-art competitors (including RTMDet and DAMO-YOLO) in both inference speed and detection accuracy. The analysis confirms that by decoupling representation learning from heuristic post-processing, YOLOv26 successfully resolves the historical trade-off between latency and precision, signaling the next evolutionary step in edge-based computer vision.</description>

      <title>Communication Methods in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a promising research area that extends established reinforcement learning approaches to problems formulated as multi-agent systems. Recently, a multitude of communication methods have been introduced to this field to address problems such as partially observable environments, non-stationarity, and exponentially growing action spaces. Communication further enables efficient cooperation among all agents interacting in an environment. This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches.</description>

      <title>AdaNODEs: Test Time Adaptation for Time Series Forecasting Using Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution to adapt pre-trained models to new, unseen data distributions using unlabeled target domain data. However, most TTA methods are designed for independent data, often overlooking the time series data and rarely addressing forecasting tasks. This paper presents AdaNODEs, an innovative source-free TTA method tailored explicitly for time series forecasting. By leveraging Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), we propose a novel adaptation framework that accommodates the unique characteristics of distribution shifts in time series data. Moreover, we innovatively propose a new loss function to tackle TTA for forecasting tasks. AdaNODEs only requires updating limited model parameters, showing effectiveness in capturing temporal dependencies while avoiding significant memory usage. Extensive experiments with one- and high-dimensional data demonstrate that AdaNODEs offer relative improvements of 5.88\% and 28.4\% over the SOTA baselines, especially demonstrating robustness across higher severity distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>From Prefix Cache to Fusion RAG Cache: Accelerating LLM Inference in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances Large Language Models by integrating external knowledge, which reduces hallucinations but increases prompt length. This increase leads to higher computational costs and longer Time to First Token (TTFT). To mitigate this issue, existing solutions aim to reuse the preprocessed KV cache of each retrieved chunk to accelerate RAG. However, the lack of cross-chunk contextual information leads to a significant drop in generation quality, leaving the potential benefits of KV cache reuse largely unfulfilled. The challenge lies in how to reuse the precomputed KV cache of chunks while preserving generation quality. We propose FusionRAG, a novel inference framework that optimizes both the preprocessing and reprocessing stages of RAG. In the offline preprocessing stage, we embed information from other related text chunks into each chunk, while in the online reprocessing stage, we recompute the KV cache for tokens that the model focuses on. As a result, we achieve a better trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. According to our experiments, FusionRAG significantly improves generation quality at the same recomputation ratio compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions. By recomputing fewer than 15% of the tokens, FusionRAG achieves up to 70% higher normalized F1 scores than baselines and reduces TTFT by 2.66x-9.39x compared to Full Attention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SciCoQA, a dataset for detecting discrepancies between scientific publications and their codebases to ensure faithful implementations. We construct SciCoQA from GitHub issues and reproducibility papers, and to scale our dataset, we propose a synthetic data generation method for constructing paper-code discrepancies. We analyze the paper-code discrepancies in detail and propose discrepancy types and categories to better understand the occurring mismatches. In total, our dataset consists of 611 paper-code discrepancies (81 real, 530 synthetic), spanning diverse computational science disciplines, including AI, Physics, Quantitative Biology, and others. Our evaluation of 21 LLMs highlights the difficulty of SciCoQA, particularly for instances involving omitted paper details, long-context inputs, and data outside the models' pre-training corpus. The best performing model in our evaluation, GPT-5, can only detect 45.7\% of real-world paper-code discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Your Privacy Depends on Others: Collusion Vulnerabilities in Individual Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individual Differential Privacy (iDP) promises users control over their privacy, but this promise can be broken in practice. We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates successful attacks against 62% of targeted individuals, substantially increasing their membership inference susceptibility. To mitigate this, we propose $(\varepsilon_i,\delta_i,\overline{\Delta})$-iDP a privacy contract that uses $\Delta$-divergences to provide users with a hard upper bound on their excess vulnerability, while offering flexibility to mechanism design. Our findings expose a fundamental challenge to the current paradigm, demanding a re-evaluation of how iDP systems are designed, audited, communicated, and deployed to make excess risks transparent and controllable.</description>

      <title>ForeDiffusion: Foresight-Conditioned Diffusion Policy via Future View Construction for Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion strategies have advanced visual motor control by progressively denoising high-dimensional action sequences, providing a promising method for robot manipulation. However, as task complexity increases, the success rate of existing baseline models decreases considerably. Analysis indicates that current diffusion strategies are confronted with two limitations. First, these strategies only rely on short-term observations as conditions. Second, the training objective remains limited to a single denoising loss, which leads to error accumulation and causes grasping deviations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Foresight-Conditioned Diffusion (ForeDiffusion), by injecting the predicted future view representation into the diffusion process. As a result, the policy is guided to be forward-looking, enabling it to correct trajectory deviations. Following this design, ForeDiffusion employs a dual loss mechanism, combining the traditional denoising loss and the consistency loss of future observations, to achieve the unified optimization. Extensive evaluation on the Adroit suite and the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrates that ForeDiffusion achieves an average success rate of 80% for the overall task, significantly outperforming the existing mainstream diffusion methods by 23% in complex tasks, while maintaining more stable performance across the entire tasks.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Test: Auditing Training Data in Object Classification Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we analyze the performance of Membership Inference Tests (MINT), focusing on determining whether given data were utilized during the training phase, specifically in the domain of object recognition. Within the area of object recognition, we propose and develop architectures tailored for MINT models. These architectures aim to optimize performance and efficiency in data utilization, offering a tailored solution to tackle the complexities inherent in the object recognition domain. We conducted experiments involving an object detection model, an embedding extractor, and a MINT module. These experiments were performed in three public databases, totaling over 174K images. The proposed architecture leverages convolutional layers to capture and model the activation patterns present in the data during the training process. Through our analysis, we are able to identify given data used for testing and training, achieving precision rates ranging between 70% and 80%, contingent upon the depth of the detection module layer chosen for input to the MINT module. Additionally, our studies entail an analysis of the factors influencing the MINT Module, delving into the contributing elements behind more transparent training processes.</description>

      <title>Online Continual Learning for Time Series: a Natural Score-driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online continual learning (OCL) methods adapt to changing environments without forgetting past knowledge. Similarly, online time series forecasting (OTSF) is a real-world problem where data evolve in time and success depends on both rapid adaptation and long-term memory. Indeed, time-varying and regime-switching forecasting models have been extensively studied, offering a strong justification for the use of OCL in these settings. Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers. Finally, we introduce Natural Score-driven Replay (NatSR), which combines our robust optimizer with a replay buffer and a dynamic scale heuristic that improves fast adaptation at regime drifts. Empirical results demonstrate that NatSR achieves stronger forecasting performance than more complex state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>On the Evidentiary Limits of Membership Inference for Copyright Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are trained on increasingly opaque corpora, membership inference attacks (MIAs) have been proposed to audit whether copyrighted texts were used during training, despite growing concerns about their reliability under realistic conditions. We ask whether MIAs can serve as admissible evidence in adversarial copyright disputes where an accused model developer may obfuscate training data while preserving semantic content, and formalize this setting through a judge-prosecutor-accused communication protocol. To test robustness under this protocol, we introduce SAGE (Structure-Aware SAE-Guided Extraction), a paraphrasing framework guided by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that rewrites training data to alter lexical structure while preserving semantic content and downstream utility. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art MIAs degrade when models are fine-tuned on SAGE-generated paraphrases, indicating that their signals are not robust to semantics-preserving transformations. While some leakage remains in certain fine-tuning regimes, these results suggest that MIAs are brittle in adversarial settings and insufficient, on their own, as a standalone mechanism for copyright auditing of LLMs.</description>

      <title>The Post-Turing Condition: Conceptualising Artificial Subjectivity and Synthetic Sociality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Post-Turing era, artificial intelligence increasingly shapes social coordination and meaning formation rather than merely automating cognitive tasks. The central challenge is therefore not whether machines become conscious, but whether processes of interpretation and shared reference are progressively automated in ways that marginalize human participation. This paper introduces the PRMO framework, relating AI design trajectories to four constitutive dimensions of human subjectivity: Perception, Representation, Meaning, and the Real. Within this framework, Synthetic Sociality denotes a technological horizon in which artificial agents negotiate coherence and social order primarily among themselves, raising the structural risk of human exclusion from meaning formation. To address this risk, the paper proposes Quadrangulation as a design principle for socially embedded AI systems, requiring artificial agents to treat the human subject as a constitutive reference within shared contexts of meaning. This work is a conceptual perspective that contributes a structural vocabulary for analyzing AI systems at the intersection of computation and society, without proposing a specific technical implementation.</description>

      <title>Active Inference-Driven World Modeling for Adaptive UAV Swarm Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an Active Inference-based framework for autonomous trajectory design in UAV swarms. The method integrates probabilistic reasoning and self-learning to enable distributed mission allocation, route ordering, and motion planning. Expert trajectories generated using a Genetic Algorithm with Repulsion Forces (GA-RF) are employed to train a hierarchical World Model capturing swarm behavior across mission, route, and motion levels. During online operation, UAVs infer actions by minimizing divergence between current beliefs and model-predicted states, enabling adaptive responses to dynamic environments. Simulation results show faster convergence, higher stability, and safer navigation than Q-Learning, demonstrating the scalability and cognitive grounding of the proposed framework for intelligent UAV swarm control.</description>

      <title>AI-generated data contamination erodes pathological variability and diagnostic reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly populating medical records with synthetic content, creating a feedback loop where future models are increasingly at risk of training on uncurated AI-generated data. However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon.</description>

      <title>Beyond Accuracy: Characterizing Code Comprehension Capabilities in (Large) Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software engineering workflows, yet current benchmarks provide only coarse performance summaries that obscure the diverse capabilities and limitations of these models. This paper investigates whether LLMs' code-comprehension performance aligns with traditional human-centric software metrics or instead reflects distinct, non-human regularities. We introduce a diagnostic framework that reframes code understanding as a binary input-output consistency task, enabling the evaluation of classification and generative models. Using a large-scale dataset, we correlate model performance with traditional, human-centric complexity metrics, such as lexical size, control-flow complexity, and abstract syntax tree structure. Our analyses reveal minimal correlation between human-defined metrics and LLM success (AUROC 0.63), while shadow models achieve substantially higher predictive performance (AUROC 0.86), capturing complex, partially predictable patterns beyond traditional software measures. These findings suggest that LLM comprehension reflects model-specific regularities only partially accessible through either human-designed or learned features, emphasizing the need for benchmark methodologies that move beyond aggregate accuracy and toward instance-level diagnostics, while acknowledging fundamental limits in predicting correct outcomes.</description>

      <title>ArchAgent: Scalable Legacy Software Architecture Recovery with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering accurate architecture from large-scale legacy software is hindered by architectural drift, missing relations, and the limited context of Large Language Models (LLMs). We present ArchAgent, a scalable agent-based framework that combines static analysis, adaptive code segmentation, and LLM-powered synthesis to reconstruct multiview, business-aligned architectures from cross-repository codebases. ArchAgent introduces scalable diagram generation with contextual pruning and integrates cross-repository data to identify business-critical modules. Evaluations of typical large-scale GitHub projects show significant improvements over existing benchmarks. An ablation study confirms that dependency context improves the accuracy of generated architectures of production-level repositories, and a real-world case study demonstrates effective recovery of critical business logics from legacy projects. The dataset is available at https://github.com/panrusheng/arch-eval-benchmark.</description>

      <title>HT-GNN: Hyper-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Customer Lifetime Value Prediction in Baidu Ads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lifetime value (LTV) prediction is crucial for news feed advertising, enabling platforms to optimize bidding and budget allocation for long-term revenue growth. However, it faces two major challenges: (1) demographic-based targeting creates segment-specific LTV distributions with large value variations across user groups; and (2) dynamic marketing strategies generate irregular behavioral sequences where engagement patterns evolve rapidly. We propose a Hyper-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HT-GNN), which jointly models demographic heterogeneity and temporal dynamics through three key components: (i) a hypergraph-supervised module capturing inter-segment relationships; (ii) a transformer-based temporal encoder with adaptive weighting; and (iii) a task-adaptive mixture-of-experts with dynamic prediction towers for multi-horizon LTV forecasting. Experiments on \textit{Baidu Ads} with 15 million users demonstrate that HT-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics and prediction horizons.</description>

      <title>Bi-Attention HateXplain : Taking into account the sequential aspect of data during explainability in a multi-task context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technological advances in the Internet and online social networks have brought many benefits to humanity. At the same time, this growth has led to an increase in hate speech, the main global threat. To improve the reliability of black-box models used for hate speech detection, post-hoc approaches such as LIME, SHAP, and LRP provide the explanation after training the classification model. In contrast, multi-task approaches based on the HateXplain benchmark learn to explain and classify simultaneously. However, results from HateXplain-based algorithms show that predicted attention varies considerably when it should be constant. This attention variability can lead to inconsistent interpretations, instability of predictions, and learning difficulties. To solve this problem, we propose the BiAtt-BiRNN-HateXplain (Bidirectional Attention BiRNN HateXplain) model which is easier to explain compared to LLMs which are more complex in view of the need for transparency, and will take into account the sequential aspect of the input data during explainability thanks to a BiRNN layer. Thus, if the explanation is correctly estimated, thanks to multi-task learning (explainability and classification task), the model could classify better and commit fewer unintentional bias errors related to communities. The experimental results on HateXplain data show a clear improvement in detection performance, explainability and a reduction in unintentional bias.</description>

      <title>PASs-MoE: Mitigating Misaligned Co-drift among Router and Experts via Pathway Activation Subspaces for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual instruction tuning (CIT) requires multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to adapt to a stream of tasks without forgetting prior capabilities. A common strategy is to isolate updates by routing inputs to different LoRA experts. However, existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods often jointly update the router and experts in an indiscriminate way, causing the router's preferences to co-drift with experts' adaptation pathways and gradually deviate from early-stage input-expert specialization. We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although state-space models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance on long-sequence benchmarks, most research has emphasized predictive accuracy rather than interpretability. In this work, we present the first systematic kernel interpretability study of the diagonalized state-space model (S4D) trained on a real-world task (vulnerability detection in source code). Through time and frequency domain analysis of the S4D kernel, we show that the long-range modeling capability of S4D varies significantly under different model architectures, affecting model performance. For instance, we show that the depending on the architecture, S4D kernel can behave as low-pass, band-pass or high-pass filter. The insights from our analysis can guide future work in designing better S4D-based models.</description>

      <title>TinyML-Enabled IoT for Sustainable Precision Irrigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-scale farming communities are disproportionately affected by water scarcity, erratic climate patterns, and a lack of access to advanced, affordable agricultural technologies. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel, edge-first IoT framework that integrates Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) for intelligent, offline-capable precision irrigation. The proposed four-layer architecture leverages low-cost hardware, an ESP32 microcontroller as an edge inference node, and a Raspberry Pi as a local edge server to enable autonomous decision-making without cloud dependency. The system utilizes capacitive soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and ambient light sensors for environmental monitoring. A rigorous comparative analysis of ensemble models identified gradient boosting as superior, achieving an R^2 score of 0.9973 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.99%, outperforming a random forest model (R^2 = 0.9916, MAPE = 1.81%). This optimized model was converted and deployed as a lightweight TinyML inference engine on the ESP32 and predicts irrigation needs with exceptional accuracy (MAPE &lt; 1%). Local communication is facilitated by an MQTT-based LAN protocol, ensuring reliable operation in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Experimental validation in a controlled environment demonstrated a significant reduction in water usage compared to traditional methods, while the system's low-power design and offline functionality confirm its viability for sustainable, scalable deployment in resource-constrained rural settings. This work provides a practical, cost-effective blueprint for bridging the technological divide in agriculture and enhancing water-use efficiency through on-device artificial intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many students lack access to expert research mentorship. We ask whether an AI mentor can move undergraduates from an idea to a paper. We build METIS, a tool-augmented, stage-aware assistant with literature search, curated guidelines, methodology checks, and memory. We evaluate METIS against GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 across six writing stages using LLM-as-a-judge pairwise preferences, student-persona rubrics, short multi-turn tutoring, and evidence/compliance checks. On 90 single-turn prompts, LLM judges preferred METIS to Claude Sonnet 4.5 in 71% and to GPT-5 in 54%. Student scores (clarity/actionability/constraint-fit; 90 prompts x 3 judges) are higher across stages. In multi-turn sessions (five scenarios/agent), METIS yields slightly higher final quality than GPT-5. Gains concentrate in document-grounded stages (D-F), consistent with stage-aware routing and groundings failure modes include premature tool routing, shallow grounding, and occasional stage misclassification.</description>

      <title>CORE-T: COherent REtrieval of Tables for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic text-to-SQL workflows often require joining multiple tables. As a result, accurately retrieving the relevant set of tables becomes a key bottleneck for end-to-end performance. We study an open-book setting where queries must be answered over large, heterogeneous table collections pooled from many sources, without clean scoping signals such as database identifiers. Here, dense retrieval (DR) achieves high recall but returns many distractors, while join-aware alternatives often rely on extra assumptions and/or incur high inference overhead. We propose CORE-T, a scalable, training-free framework that enriches tables with LLM-generated purpose metadata and pre-computes a lightweight table-compatibility cache. At inference time, DR returns top-K candidates; a single LLM call selects a coherent, joinable subset, and a simple additive adjustment step restores strongly compatible tables. Across Bird, Spider, and MMQA, CORE-T improves table-selection F1 by up to 22.7 points while retrieving up to 42% fewer tables, improving multi-table execution accuracy by up to 5.0 points on Bird and 6.9 points on MMQA, and using 4-5x fewer tokens than LLM-intensive baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intent-based networks (IBNs) are gaining prominence as an innovative technology that automates network operations through high-level request statements, defining what the network should achieve. In this work, we introduce IntAgent, an intelligent intent LLM agent that integrates NWDAF analytics and tools to fulfill the network operator's intents. Unlike previous approaches, we develop an intent tools engine directly within the NWDAF analytics engine, allowing our agent to utilize live network analytics to inform its reasoning and tool selection. We offer an enriched, 3GPP-compliant data source that enhances the dynamic, context-aware fulfillment of network operator goals, along with an MCP tools server for scheduling, monitoring, and analytics tools. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through two practical use cases: ML-based traffic prediction and scheduled policy enforcement, which validate IntAgent's ability to autonomously fulfill complex network intents.</description>

      <title>TVWorld: Foundations for Remote-Control TV Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for device control. However, existing research has primarily focused on point-and-click (PnC) interaction, while remote-control (RC) interaction commonly encountered in everyday TV usage remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{TVWorld}, an offline graph-based abstraction of real-world TV navigation that enables reproducible and deployment-free evaluation. On this basis, we derive two complementary benchmarks that comprehensively assess TV-use capabilities: \textbf{TVWorld-N} for topology-aware navigation and \textbf{TVWorld-G} for focus-aware grounding. These benchmarks expose a key limitation of existing agents: insufficient topology awareness for focus-based, long-horizon TV navigation. Motivated by this finding, we propose a \emph{Topology-Aware Training} framework that injects topology awareness into LVLMs. Using this framework, we develop \textbf{TVTheseus}, a foundation model specialized for TV navigation. TVTheseus achieves a success rate of $68.3\%$ on TVWorld-N, surpassing strong closed-source baselines such as Gemini 3 Flash and establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additional analyses further provide valuable insights into the development of effective TV-use agents.</description>

      <title>Training instability in deep learning follows low-dimensional dynamical principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning systems achieve remarkable empirical performance, yet the stability of the training process itself remains poorly understood. Training unfolds as a high-dimensional dynamical system in which small perturbations to optimization, data, parameters, or learning signals can induce abrupt and irreversible collapse, undermining reproducibility and scalability.
  We propose a unified dynamical perspective that characterizes training stability as an intrinsic property of learning systems, organized along four interacting dimensions: optimization, environmental/data, parametric, and learning-signal stability. We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.
  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse. Together, these findings establish training stability as a measurable and comparable dynamical property of learning systems, providing a descriptive foundation for studying learning dynamics beyond final performance outcomes.</description>

      <title>From 100,000+ images to winning the first brain MRI foundation model challenges: Sharing lessons and models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing Foundation Models for medical image analysis is essential to overcome the unique challenges of radiological tasks. The first challenges of this kind for 3D brain MRI, SSL3D and FOMO25, were held at MICCAI 2025. Our solution ranked first in tracks of both contests. It relies on a U-Net CNN architecture combined with strategies leveraging anatomical priors and neuroimaging domain knowledge. Notably, our models trained 1-2 orders of magnitude faster and were 10 times smaller than competing transformer-based approaches. Models are available here: https://github.com/jbanusco/BrainFM4Challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly reshaping scientific research. We analyze these changes in multiple, large-scale datasets with 2.1M preprints, 28K peer review reports, and 246M online accesses to scientific documents. We find: 1) scientists adopting LLMs to draft manuscripts demonstrate a large increase in paper production, ranging from 23.7-89.3% depending on scientific field and author background, 2) LLM use has reversed the relationship between writing complexity and paper quality, leading to an influx of manuscripts that are linguistically complex but substantively underwhelming, and 3) LLM adopters access and cite more diverse prior work, including books and younger, less-cited documents. These findings highlight a stunning shift in scientific production that will likely require a change in how journals, funding agencies, and tenure committees evaluate scientific works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance refers to a situation where certain classes in a dataset have significantly fewer samples than oth- ers, leading to biased model performance. Class imbalance in network intrusion detection using Tabular Denoising Diffusion Probability Models (TabDDPM) for data augmentation is ad- dressed in this paper. Our approach synthesizes high-fidelity minority-class samples from the CIC-IDS2017 dataset through iterative denoising processes. For the minority classes that have smaller samples, synthetic samples were generated and merged with the original dataset. The augmented training data enables an ANN classifier to achieve near-perfect recall on previously underrepresented attack classes. These results establish diffusion models as an effective solution for tabular data imbalance in security domains, with potential applications in fraud detection and medical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-shot Writing: Deep Research Agents are Unreliable at Multi-turn Report Revision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Deep Research Agents (DRAs) treat report generation as a single-shot writing task, which fundamentally diverges from how human researchers iteratively draft and revise reports via self-reflection or peer feedback. Whether DRAs can reliably revise reports with user feedback remains unexplored. We introduce Mr Dre, an evaluation suite that establishes multi-turn report revision as a new evaluation axis for DRAs. Mr Dre consists of (1) a unified long-form report evaluation protocol spanning comprehensiveness, factuality, and presentation, and (2) a human-verified feedback simulation pipeline for multi-turn revision. Our analysis of five diverse DRAs reveals a critical limitation: while agents can address most user feedback, they also regress on 16-27% of previously covered content and citation quality. Over multiple revision turns, even the best-performing agents leave significant headroom, as they continue to disrupt content outside the feedback's scope and fail to preserve earlier edits. We further show that these issues are not easily resolvable through inference-time fixes such as prompt engineering and a dedicated sub-agent for report revision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RAGE systems integrate ideas from automatic evaluation (E) into Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG). As one such example, we present Crucible, a Nugget-Augmented Generation System that preserves explicit citation provenance by constructing a bank of Q&amp;A nuggets from retrieved documents and uses them to guide extraction, selection, and report generation. Reasoning on nuggets avoids repeated information through clear and interpretable Q&amp;A semantics - instead of opaque cluster abstractions - while maintaining citation provenance throughout the entire generation process. Evaluated on the TREC NeuCLIR 2024 collection, our Crucible system substantially outperforms Ginger, a recent nugget-based RAG system, in nugget recall, density, and citation grounding.</description>

      <title>Insider Knowledge: How Much Can RAG Systems Gain from Evaluation Secrets?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RAG systems are increasingly evaluated and optimized using LLM judges, an approach that is rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for system assessment. Nugget-based approaches in particular are now embedded not only in evaluation frameworks but also in the architectures of RAG systems themselves. While this integration can lead to genuine improvements, it also creates a risk of faulty measurements due to circularity. In this paper, we investigate this risk through comparative experiments with nugget-based RAG systems, including Ginger and Crucible, against strong baselines such as GPT-Researcher. By deliberately modifying Crucible to generate outputs optimized for an LLM judge, we show that near-perfect evaluation scores can be achieved when elements of the evaluation - such as prompt templates or gold nuggets - are leaked or can be predicted. Our results highlight the importance of blind evaluation settings and methodological diversity to guard against mistaking metric overfitting for genuine system progress.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Models Rival Diffusion Models at ANY-ORDER Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion language models enable any-order generation and bidirectional conditioning, offering appealing flexibility for tasks such as infilling, rewriting, and self-correction. However, their formulation-predicting one part of a sequence from another within a single-step dependency-limits modeling depth and often yields lower sample quality and stability than autoregressive (AR) models. To address this, we revisit autoregressive modeling as a foundation and reformulate diffusion-style training into a structured multi-group prediction process. We propose Any-order Any-subset Autoregressive modeling (A3), a generalized framework that extends the standard AR factorization to arbitrary token groups and generation orders. A3 preserves the probabilistic rigor and multi-layer dependency modeling of AR while inheriting diffusion models' flexibility for parallel and bidirectional generation. We implement A3 through a two-stream attention architecture and a progressive adaptation strategy that transitions pretrained AR models toward any-order prediction. Experiments on question answering, commonsense reasoning, and story infilling demonstrate that A3 outperforms diffusion-based models while maintaining flexible decoding. This work offers a unified approach for a flexible, efficient, and novel language modeling paradigm.</description>

      <title>RubRIX: Rubric-Driven Risk Mitigation in Caregiver-AI Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Caregivers seeking AI-mediated support express complex needs -- information-seeking, emotional validation, and distress cues -- that warrant careful evaluation of response safety and appropriateness. Existing AI evaluation frameworks, primarily focused on general risks (toxicity, hallucinations, policy violations, etc), may not adequately capture the nuanced risks of LLM-responses in caregiving-contexts. We introduce RubRIX (Rubric-based Risk Index), a theory-driven, clinician-validated framework for evaluating risks in LLM caregiving responses. Grounded in the Elements of an Ethic of Care, RubRIX operationalizes five empirically-derived risk dimensions: Inattention, Bias &amp; Stigma, Information Inaccuracy, Uncritical Affirmation, and Epistemic Arrogance. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs on over 20,000 caregiver queries from Reddit and ALZConnected. Rubric-guided refinement consistently reduced risk-components by 45-98% after one iteration across models. This work contributes a methodological approach for developing domain-sensitive, user-centered evaluation frameworks for high-burden contexts. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-sensitive, interactional risk evaluation for the responsible deployment of LLMs in caregiving support contexts. We release benchmark datasets to enable future research on contextual risk evaluation in AI-mediated support.</description>

      <title>Pixelwise Uncertainty Quantification of Accelerated MRI Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel imaging techniques reduce magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan time but image quality degrades as the acceleration factor increases. In clinical practice, conservative acceleration factors are chosen because no mechanism exists to automatically assess the diagnostic quality of undersampled reconstructions. This work introduces a general framework for pixel-wise uncertainty quantification in parallel MRI reconstructions, enabling automatic identification of unreliable regions without access to any ground-truth reference image. Our method integrates conformal quantile regression with image reconstruction methods to estimate statistically rigorous pixel-wise uncertainty intervals. We trained and evaluated our model on Cartesian undersampled brain and knee data obtained from the fastMRI dataset using acceleration factors ranging from 2 to 10. An end-to-end Variational Network was used for image reconstruction. Quantitative experiments demonstrate strong agreement between predicted uncertainty maps and true reconstruction error. Using our method, the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient was higher than 90% at acceleration levels at and above four-fold; whereas it dropped to less than 70% when the uncertainty was computed using a simpler a heuristic notion (magnitude of the residual). Qualitative examples further show the uncertainty maps based on quantile regression capture the magnitude and spatial distribution of reconstruction errors across acceleration factors, with regions of elevated uncertainty aligning with pathologies and artifacts. The proposed framework enables evaluation of reconstruction quality without access to fully-sampled ground-truth reference images. It represents a step toward adaptive MRI acquisition protocols that may be able to dynamically balance scan time and diagnostic reliability.</description>

      <title>A Semantic Decoupling-Based Two-Stage Rainy-Day Attack for Revealing Weather Robustness Deficiencies in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trained on image-text pairs collected under canonical visual conditions and achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks. However, their robustness to real-world weather conditions, and the stability of cross-modal semantic alignment under such structured perturbations, remain insufficiently studied. In this paper, we focus on rainy scenarios and introduce the first adversarial framework that exploits realistic weather to attack VLMs, using a two-stage, parameterized perturbation model based on semantic decoupling to analyze rain-induced shifts in decision-making. In Stage 1, we model the global effects of rainfall by applying a low-dimensional global modulation to condition the embedding space and gradually weaken the original semantic decision boundaries. In Stage 2, we introduce structured rain variations by explicitly modeling multi-scale raindrop appearance and rainfall-induced illumination changes, and optimize the resulting non-differentiable weather space to induce stable semantic shifts. Operating in a non-pixel parameter space, our framework generates perturbations that are both physically grounded and interpretable. Experiments across multiple tasks show that even physically plausible, highly constrained weather perturbations can induce substantial semantic misalignment in mainstream VLMs, posing potential safety and reliability risks in real-world deployment. Ablations further confirm that illumination modeling and multi-scale raindrop structures are key drivers of these semantic shifts.</description>

      <title>KOCO-BENCH: Can Large Language Models Leverage Domain Knowledge in Software Development?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general programming but struggle with domain-specific software development, necessitating domain specialization methods for LLMs to learn and utilize domain knowledge and data. However, existing domain-specific code benchmarks cannot evaluate the effectiveness of domain specialization methods, which focus on assessing what knowledge LLMs possess rather than how they acquire and apply new knowledge, lacking explicit knowledge corpora for developing domain specialization methods. To this end, we present KOCO-BENCH, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating domain specialization methods in real-world software development. KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&amp;A). Unlike previous benchmarks that only provide test sets for direct evaluation, KOCO-BENCH requires acquiring and applying diverse domain knowledge (APIs, rules, constraints, etc.) from knowledge corpora to solve evaluation tasks. Our evaluations reveal that KOCO-BENCH poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art LLMs. Even with domain specialization methods (e.g., SFT, RAG, kNN-LM) applied, improvements remain marginal. Best-performing coding agent, Claude Code, achieves only 34.2%, highlighting the urgent need for more effective domain specialization methods. We release KOCO-BENCH, evaluation code, and baselines to advance further research at https://github.com/jiangxxxue/KOCO-bench.</description>

      <title>Aligning Agentic World Models via Knowledgeable Experience Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a critical modal disconnect: they possess vast semantic knowledge but lack the procedural grounding to respect the immutable laws of the physical world. Consequently, while these agents implicitly function as world models, their simulations often suffer from physical hallucinations-generating plans that are logically sound but physically unexecutable. Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback. Specifically, it unifies Process Experience to enforce physical feasibility via prediction errors and Goal Experience to guide task optimality through successful trajectories. Experiments on EB-ALFRED and EB-Habitat demonstrate that WorldMind achieves superior performance compared to baselines with remarkable cross-model and cross-environment transferability.</description>

      <title>Stop Taking Tokenizers for Granted: They Are Core Design Decisions in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenization underlies every large language model, yet it remains an under-theorized and inconsistently designed component. Common subword approaches such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) offer scalability but often misalign with linguistic structure, amplify bias, and waste capacity across languages and domains. This paper reframes tokenization as a core modeling decision rather than a preprocessing step. We argue for a context-aware framework that integrates tokenizer and model co-design, guided by linguistic, domain, and deployment considerations. Standardized evaluation and transparent reporting are essential to make tokenization choices accountable and comparable. Treating tokenization as a core design problem, not a technical afterthought, can yield language technologies that are fairer, more efficient, and more adaptable.</description>

      <title>AI Skills Improve Job Prospects: Causal Evidence from a Hiring Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has heightened interest in the labour market value of AI-related skills, yet causal evidence on their role in hiring decisions remains scarce. This study examines whether AI skills serve as a positive hiring signal and whether they can offset conventional disadvantages such as older age or lower formal education. We conduct an experimental survey with 1,700 recruiters from the United Kingdom and the United States. Using a paired conjoint design, recruiters evaluated hypothetical candidates represented by synthetically designed resumes. Across three occupations - graphic designer, office assistant, and software engineer - AI skills significantly increase interview invitation probabilities by approximately 8 to 15 percentage points. AI skills also partially or fully offset disadvantages related to age and lower education, with effects strongest for office assistants, where formal AI certification plays an additional compensatory role. Effects are weaker for graphic designers, consistent with more skeptical recruiter attitudes toward AI in creative work. Finally, recruiters' own background and AI usage significantly moderate these effects. Overall, the findings demonstrate that AI skills function as a powerful hiring signal and can mitigate traditional labour market disadvantages, with implications for workers' skill acquisition strategies and firms' recruitment practices.</description>

      <title>CooperBench: Why Coding Agents Cannot be Your Teammates Yet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resolving team conflicts requires not only task-specific competence, but also social intelligence to find common ground and build consensus. As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence.</description>

      <title>Paid Voices vs. Public Feeds: Interpretable Cross-Platform Theme Modeling of Climate Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate discourse online plays a crucial role in shaping public understanding of climate change and influencing political and policy outcomes. However, climate communication unfolds across structurally distinct platforms with fundamentally different incentive structures: paid advertising ecosystems incentivize targeted, strategic persuasion, while public social media platforms host largely organic, user-driven discourse. Existing computational studies typically analyze these environments in isolation, limiting our ability to distinguish institutional messaging from public expression. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of climate discourse across paid advertisements on Meta (previously known as Facebook) and public posts on Bluesky from July 2024 to September 2025. We introduce an interpretable, end-to-end thematic discovery and assignment framework that clusters texts by semantic similarity and leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate concise, human-interpretable theme labels. We evaluate the quality of the induced themes against traditional topic modeling baselines using both human judgments and an LLM-based evaluator, and further validate their semantic coherence through downstream stance prediction and theme-guided retrieval tasks. Applying the resulting themes, we characterize systematic differences between paid climate messaging and public climate discourse and examine how thematic prevalence shifts around major political events. Our findings show that platform-level incentives are reflected in the thematic structure, stance alignment, and temporal responsiveness of climate narratives. While our empirical analysis focuses on climate communication, the proposed framework is designed to support comparative narrative analysis across heterogeneous communication environments.</description>

      <title>The AI Genie Phenomenon and Three Types of AI Chatbot Addiction: Escapist Roleplays, Pseudosocial Companions, and Epistemic Rabbit Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent reports on generative AI chatbot use raise concerns about its addictive potential. An in-depth understanding is imperative to minimize risks, yet AI chatbot addiction remains poorly understood. This study examines how to characterize AI chatbot addiction--why users become addicted, the symptoms commonly reported, and the distinct types it comprises. We conducted a thematic analysis of Reddit entries (n=334) across 14 subreddits where users narrated their experiences with addictive AI chatbot use, followed by an exploratory data analysis. We found: (1) users' dependence tied to the "AI Genie" phenomenon--users can get exactly anything they want with minimal effort--and marked by symptoms that align with addiction literature, (2) three distinct addiction types: Escapist Roleplay, Pseudosocial Companion, and Epistemic Rabbit Hole, (3) sexual content involved in multiple cases, and (4) recovery strategies' perceived helpfulness differ between addiction types. Our work lays empirical groundwork to inform future strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and intervention.</description>

      <title>LLM-as-RNN: A Recurrent Language Model for Memory Updates and Sequence Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are strong sequence predictors, yet standard inference relies on immutable context histories. After making an error at generation step t, the model lacks an updatable memory mechanism that improves predictions for step t+1. We propose LLM-as-RNN, an inference-only framework that turns a frozen LLM into a recurrent predictor by representing its hidden state as natural-language memory. This state, implemented as a structured system-prompt summary, is updated at each timestep via feedback-driven text rewrites, enabling learning without parameter updates. Under a fixed token budget, LLM-as-RNN corrects errors and retains task-relevant patterns, effectively performing online learning through language. We evaluate the method on three sequential benchmarks in healthcare, meteorology, and finance across Llama, Gemma, and GPT model families. LLM-as-RNN significantly outperforms zero-shot, full-history, and MemPrompt baselines, improving predictive accuracy by 6.5% on average, while producing interpretable, human-readable learning traces absent in standard context accumulation.</description>

      <title>Bounded Minds, Generative Machines: Envisioning Conversational AI that Works with Human Heuristics and Reduces Bias Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational AI is rapidly becoming a primary interface for information seeking and decision making, yet most systems still assume idealized users. In practice, human reasoning is bounded by limited attention, uneven knowledge, and reliance on heuristics that are adaptive but bias-prone. This article outlines a research pathway grounded in bounded rationality, and argues that conversational AI should be designed to work with human heuristics rather than against them. It identifies key directions for detecting cognitive vulnerability, supporting judgment under uncertainty, and evaluating conversational systems beyond factual accuracy, toward decision quality and cognitive robustness.</description>

      <title>Organ-Aware Attention Improves CT Triage and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an urgent need for triage and classification of high-volume medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), which can improve patient care and mitigate radiologist burnout. Study-level CT triage requires calibrated predictions with localized evidence; however, off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLM) struggle with 3D anatomy, protocol shifts, and noisy report supervision. This study used the two largest publicly available chest CT datasets: CT-RATE and RADCHEST-CT (held-out external test set). Our carefully tuned supervised baseline (instantiated as a simple Global Average Pooling head) establishes a new supervised state of the art, surpassing all reported linear-probe VLMs. Building on this baseline, we present ORACLE-CT, an encoder-agnostic, organ-aware head that pairs Organ-Masked Attention (mask-restricted, per-organ pooling that yields spatial evidence) with Organ-Scalar Fusion (lightweight fusion of normalized volume and mean-HU cues). In the chest setting, ORACLE-CT masked attention model achieves AUROC 0.86 on CT-RATE; in the abdomen setting, on MERLIN (30 findings), our supervised baseline exceeds a reproduced zero-shot VLM baseline obtained by running publicly released weights through our pipeline, and adding masked attention plus scalar fusion further improves performance to AUROC 0.85. Together, these results deliver state-of-the-art supervised classification performance across both chest and abdomen CT under a unified evaluation protocol.

      <title>Beyond Memorization: Testing LLM Reasoning on Unseen Theory of Computation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on formal language tasks, yet whether this reflects genuine symbolic reasoning or pattern matching on familiar constructions remains unclear. We introduce a benchmark for deterministic finite automata (DFA) construction from regular languages, comprising factual knowledge questions, seen construction problems from public sources, and two types of unseen problems: hand-crafted instances with multiple interacting constraints and systematically generated problems via Arden's theorem. Models achieve perfect accuracy on factual questions and 84-90% on seen tasks. However, accuracy drops sharply on unseen problems (by 30-64%), with failures stemming from systematic misinterpretation of language constraints, incorrect handling of Kleene-star semantics, and a failure to preserve global consistency. We evaluate a three-stage hint protocol that enables correction of shallow errors but does not reliably resolve globally inconsistent or structurally flawed automata. Our analysis across multiple prompting strategies (direct, Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought) reveals that errors persist regardless of prompting approach, exposing a fundamental gap between LLMs' ability to generate syntactically plausible DFAs and their capacity for semantically correct formal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Compress (and Decompress)? Evaluating Code Understanding and Execution via Invertibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs demonstrate strong performance on code benchmarks, yet round-trip code execution reveals limitations in their ability to maintain consistent reasoning across forward and backward execution. We present RoundTripCodeEval (RTCE), a comprehensive benchmark consisting of four distinct code execution reasoning tasks designed to rigorously test round-trip consistency. RTCE provides an execution-free, exact-match evaluation of bijection fidelity, assessing whether models preserve a consistent one-to-one mapping between encoding and decoding operations across various algorithms and directions. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art Code-LLMs using zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on execution traces, and self-reflection mechanisms. Each yields modest improvements, but none closes the gap, indicating that current LLMs struggle with true round-trip consistency, which demonstrates that they lack the internal coherence required for trustworthy code reasoning. RTCE surfaces several new and previously unmeasured insights that are not captured by existing I/O-prediction, execution-reasoning, or round-trip natural-language benchmarks. We will release the code and the dataset upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Deep Image Prior with L0 Gradient Regularizer for Image Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image smoothing is a fundamental image processing operation that preserves the underlying structure, such as strong edges and contours, and removes minor details and textures in an image. Many image smoothing algorithms rely on computing local window statistics or solving an optimization problem. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage deep learning, but they require a carefully curated training dataset. Because constructing a proper training dataset for image smoothing is challenging, we propose DIP-$\ell_0$, a deep image prior framework that incorporates the $\ell_0$ gradient regularizer. This framework can perform high-quality image smoothing without any training data. To properly minimize the associated loss function that has the nonconvex, nonsmooth $\ell_0$ ``norm", we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that utilizes an off-the-shelf $\ell_0$ gradient minimization solver. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DIP-$\ell_0$ outperforms many image smoothing algorithms in edge-preserving image smoothing and JPEG artifact removal.</description>

      <title>Reasoning with Pixel-level Precision: QVLM Architecture and SQuID Dataset for Quantitative Geospatial Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail at quantitative spatial reasoning because their architectures destroy pixel-level information required for counting and measurements. Vision encoders compress images through patch embeddings, reducing spatial indexing and losing the precise pixel-level tracking required for accurate counting. We present two contributions to address this fundamental limitation. First, we introduce SQuID (Satellite Quantitative Intelligence Dataset), a benchmark of 2,000 satellite image Question-Answer pairs with both numerical range and categorical answers, designed to evaluate quantitative spatial reasoning. The dataset spans three difficulty tiers with annotations automatically generated from human labels and their learned variability. Second, we propose QVLM (Quantitative Vision-Language Model), a code-generation architecture that maintains pixel precision by decoupling language understanding from visual analysis. Instead of encoding images into embeddings, QVLM generates executable code that first calls a segmentation model to obtain pixel-level masks, then operates directly on these masks, preserving spatial indexing throughout the reasoning process. Our experiments show that QVLM using GPT-5 as coder achieves 42.0% accuracy on SQuID compared to 28.1% for a VLM prompted with image-question pairs. Our work reveals that, for quantitative spatial reasoning, architectural decoupling enables better accuracy on quantitative tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep neural networks are extremely effective at classifying images, they remain opaque and hard to interpret. We introduce local and global explanation methods for black-box models that generate explanations in terms of human-recognizable primitive concepts. Both the local explanations for a single image and the global explanations for a set of images are cast as logical formulas in monotone disjunctive-normal-form (MDNF), whose satisfaction guarantees that the model yields a high score on a given class. We also present an algorithm for explaining the classification of examples into multiple classes in the form of a monotone explanation list over primitive concepts. Despite their simplicity and interpretability we show that the explanations maintain high fidelity and coverage with respect to the blackbox models they seek to explain in challenging vision datasets.</description>

      <title>Integrating Virtual Reality and Large Language Models for Team-Based Non-Technical Skills Training and Evaluation in the Operating Room</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although effective teamwork and communication are critical to surgical safety, structured training for non-technical skills (NTS) remains limited compared with technical simulation. The ACS/APDS Phase III Team-Based Skills Curriculum calls for scalable tools that both teach and objectively assess these competencies during laparoscopic emergencies. We introduce the Virtual Operating Room Team Experience (VORTeX), a multi-user virtual reality (VR) platform that integrates immersive team simulation with large language model (LLM) analytics to train and evaluate communication, decision-making, teamwork, and leadership. Team dialogue is analyzed using structured prompts derived from the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) framework, enabling automated classification of behaviors and generation of directed interaction graphs that quantify communication structure and hierarchy. Two laparoscopic emergency scenarios, pneumothorax and intra-abdominal bleeding, were implemented to elicit realistic stress and collaboration. Twelve surgical professionals completed pilot sessions at the 2024 SAGES conference, rating VORTeX as intuitive, immersive, and valuable for developing teamwork and communication. The LLM consistently produced interpretable communication networks reflecting expected operative hierarchies, with surgeons as central integrators, nurses as initiators, and anesthesiologists as balanced intermediaries. By integrating immersive VR with LLM-driven behavioral analytics, VORTeX provides a scalable, privacy-compliant framework for objective assessment and automated, data-informed debriefing across distributed training environments.</description>

      <title>Using deep learning for predicting cleansing quality of colon capsule endoscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of deep learning techniques for predicting cleansing quality in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) images. Using a dataset of 500 images labeled by 14 clinicians on the Leighton-Rex scale (Poor, Fair, Good, and Excellent), a ResNet-18 model was trained for classification, leveraging stratified K-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance. To optimize the model, structured pruning techniques were applied iteratively, achieving significant sparsity while maintaining high accuracy. Explainability of the pruned model was evaluated using Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Eigen-CAM, Ablation-CAM, and Random-CAM, with the ROAD method employed for consistent evaluation. Our results indicate that for a pruned model, we can achieve a cross-validation accuracy of 88% with 79% sparsity, demonstrating the effectiveness of pruning in improving efficiency from 84% without compromising performance. We also highlight the challenges of evaluating cleansing quality of CCE images, emphasize the importance of explainability in clinical applications, and discuss the challenges associated with using the ROAD method for our task. Finally, we employ a variant of adaptive temperature scaling to calibrate the pruned models for an external dataset.</description>

      <title>TrustEnergy: A Unified Framework for Accurate and Reliable User-level Energy Usage Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy usage prediction is important for various real-world applications, including grid management, infrastructure planning, and disaster response. Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>A Learnable Wavelet Transformer for Long-Short Equity Trading and Risk-Adjusted Return Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning profitable intraday trading policies from financial time series is challenging due to heavy noise, non-stationarity, and strong cross-sectional dependence among related assets. We propose \emph{WaveLSFormer}, a learnable wavelet-based long-short Transformer that jointly performs multi-scale decomposition and return-oriented decision learning. Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget, and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends. On average in all industries, WaveLSFormer achieves a cumulative overall strategy return of $0.607 \pm 0.045$ and a Sharpe ratio of $2.157 \pm 0.166$, substantially improving both profitability and risk-adjusted returns over the strongest baselines.</description>

      <title>MOSLD-Bench: Multilingual Open-Set Learning and Discovery Benchmark for Text Categorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-set learning and discovery (OSLD) is a challenging machine learning task in which samples from new (unknown) classes can appear at test time. It can be seen as a generalization of zero-shot learning, where the new classes are not known a priori, hence involving the active discovery of new classes. While zero-shot learning has been extensively studied in text classification, especially with the emergence of pre-trained language models, open-set learning and discovery is a comparatively new setup for the text domain. To this end, we introduce the first multilingual open-set learning and discovery (MOSLD) benchmark for text categorization by topic, comprising 960K data samples across 12 languages. To construct the benchmark, we (i) rearrange existing datasets and (ii) collect new data samples from the news domain. Moreover, we propose a novel framework for the OSLD task, which integrates multiple stages to continuously discover and learn new classes. We evaluate several language models, including our own, to obtain results that can be used as reference for future work. We release our benchmark at https://github.com/Adriana19Valentina/MOSLD-Bench.</description>

      <title>Labels or Preferences? Budget-Constrained Learning with Human Judgments over AI-Generated Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on human preference feedback to judge AI-generated pseudo labels has created a pressing need for principled, budget-conscious data acquisition strategies. We address the crucial question of how to optimally allocate a fixed annotation budget between ground-truth labels and pairwise preferences in AI. Our solution, grounded in semi-parametric inference, casts the budget allocation problem as a monotone missing data framework. Building on this formulation, we introduce Preference-Calibrated Active Learning (PCAL), a novel method that learns the optimal data acquisition strategy and develops a statistically efficient estimator for functionals of the data distribution. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our PCAL estimator and establish a key robustness guarantee that ensures robust performance even with poorly estimated nuisance models. Our flexible framework applies to a general class of problems, by directly optimizing the estimator's variance instead of requiring a closed-form solution. This work provides a principled and statistically efficient approach for budget-constrained learning in modern AI. Simulations and real-data analysis demonstrate the practical benefits and superior performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning Benefits of Spectral Orthogonalization in Muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Muon optimizer, a matrix-structured algorithm that leverages spectral orthogonalization of gradients, is a milestone in the pretraining of large language models. However, the underlying mechanisms of Muon -- particularly the role of gradient orthogonalization -- remain poorly understood, with very few works providing end-to-end analyses that rigorously explain its advantages in concrete applications. We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior. Our theory formalizes the preconditioning effect induced by spectral orthogonalization, offering insight into Muon's effectiveness in these matrix optimization problems and potentially beyond.</description>

      <title>A Unified Variational Imputation Framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Data Using Retrieval-Augmented Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliability of data-driven applications in electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, such as charging demand forecasting, hinges on the availability of complete, high-quality charging data. However, real-world EV datasets are often plagued by missing records, and existing imputation methods are ill-equipped for the complex, multimodal context of charging data, often relying on a restrictive one-model-per-station paradigm that ignores valuable inter-station correlations. To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that PRAIM significantly outperforms established baselines in both imputation accuracy and its ability to preserve the original data's statistical distribution, leading to substantial improvements in downstream forecasting performance.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Toll of Social Media News: Causal Effects on Psychosocial Wellbeing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: News consumption on social media has become ubiquitous, yet how different forms of engagement shape psychosocial outcomes remains unclear. To address this gap, we leveraged a large-scale dataset of ~26M posts and ~45M comments on the BlueSky platform, and conducted a quasi-experimental study, matching 81,345 Treated users exposed to News feeds with 83,711 Control users using stratified propensity score analysis. We examined psychosocial wellbeing, in terms of affective, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that news engagement produces systematic trade-offs: increased depression, stress, and anxiety, yet decreased loneliness and increased social interaction on the platform. Regression models reveal that News feed bookmarking is associated with greater psychosocial deterioration compared to commenting or quoting, with magnitude differences exceeding tenfold. These per-engagement effects accumulate with repeated exposure, showing significant psychosocial impacts. Our work extends theories of news effects beyond crisis-centric frameworks by demonstrating that routine consumption creates distinct psychological dynamics depending on engagement type, and bears implications for tools and interventions for mitigating the psychosocial costs of news consumption on social media.</description>

      <title>CatMaster: An Agentic Autonomous System for Computational Heterogeneous Catalysis Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is widely used to connect atomic structure with catalytic behavior, but computational heterogeneous catalysis studies often require long workflows that are costly, iterative, and sensitive to setup choices. Besides the intrinsic cost and accuracy limits of first-principles calculations, practical workflow issues such as keeping references consistent, preparing many related inputs, recovering from failed runs on computing clusters, and maintaining a complete record of what was done, can slow down projects and make results difficult to reproduce or extend.
  Here we present CatMaster, a large-language-model (LLM)-driven agent system that turns natural language requests into complete calculation workspaces, including structures, inputs, outputs, logs, and a concise run record. CatMaster maintains a persistent project record of key facts, constraints, and file pointers to support inspection and restartability. It is paired with a multi-fidelity tool library that covers rapid surrogate relaxations and high-fidelity DFT calculations for validation when needed. We demonstrate CatMaster on four demonstrations of increasing complexity: an O2 spin-state check with remote execution, BCC Fe surface energies with a protocol-sensitivity study and CO adsorption site ranking, high-throughput Pt--Ni--Cu alloy screening for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) descriptors with surrogate-to-DFT validation, and a demonstration beyond the predefined tool set, including equation-of-state fitting for BCC Fe and CO-FeN4-graphene single-atom catalyst geometry preparation. By reducing manual scripting and bookkeeping while keeping the full evidence trail, CatMaster aims to help catalysis researchers focus on modeling choices and chemical interpretation rather than workflow management.</description>

      <title>Automatic Adjustment of HPA Parameters and Attack Prevention in Kubernetes Using Random Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, HTTP status codes are used as custom metrics within the HPA as the experimental scenario. By integrating the Random Forest classification algorithm from machine learning, attacks are assessed and predicted, dynamically adjusting the maximum pod parameter in the HPA to manage attack traffic. This approach enables the adjustment of HPA parameters using machine learning scripts in targeted attack scenarios while effectively managing attack traffic. All access from attacking IPs is redirected to honeypot pods, achieving a lower incidence of 5XX status codes through HPA pod adjustments under high load conditions. This method also ensures effective isolation of attack traffic, preventing excessive HPA expansion due to attacks. Additionally, experiments conducted under various conditions demonstrate the importance of setting appropriate thresholds for HPA adjustments.</description>

      <title>Eliciting Harmful Capabilities by Fine-Tuning On Safeguarded Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model developers implement safeguards in frontier models to prevent misuse, for example, by employing classifiers to filter dangerous outputs. In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards.</description>

      <title>MN-TSG:Continuous Time Series Generation with Irregular Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) plays a critical role in a wide range of domains, such as healthcare. However, most existing methods assume regularly sampled observations and fixed output resolutions, which are often misaligned with real-world scenarios where data are irregularly sampled and sparsely observed. This mismatch is particularly problematic in applications such as clinical monitoring, where irregular measurements must support downstream tasks requiring continuous and high-resolution time series.
  Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) have shown strong potential for modeling irregular time series, yet they still face challenges in capturing complex dynamic temporal patterns and supporting continuous TSG. To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.
  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.
  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks.</description>

      <title>When Wording Steers the Evaluation: Framing Bias in LLM judges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to produce varying responses depending on prompt phrasing, indicating that subtle guidance in phrasing can steer their answers. However, the impact of this framing bias on LLM-based evaluation, where models are expected to make stable and impartial judgments, remains largely underexplored. Drawing inspiration from the framing effect in psychology, we systematically investigate how deliberate prompt framing skews model judgments across four high-stakes evaluation tasks. We design symmetric prompts using predicate-positive and predicate-negative constructions and demonstrate that such framing induces significant discrepancies in model outputs. Across 14 LLM judges, we observe clear susceptibility to framing, with model families showing distinct tendencies toward agreement or rejection. These findings suggest that framing bias is a structural property of current LLM-based evaluation systems, underscoring the need for framing-aware protocols.</description>

      <title>HateXScore: A Metric Suite for Evaluating Reasoning Quality in Hate Speech Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hateful speech detection is a key component of content moderation, yet current evaluation frameworks rarely assess why a text is deemed hateful. We introduce \textsf{HateXScore}, a four-component metric suite designed to evaluate the reasoning quality of model explanations. It assesses (i) conclusion explicitness, (ii) faithfulness and causal grounding of quoted spans, (iii) protected group identification (policy-configurable), and (iv) logical consistency among these elements. Evaluated on six diverse hate speech datasets, \textsf{HateXScore} is intended as a diagnostic complement to reveal interpretability failures and annotation inconsistencies that are invisible to standard metrics like Accuracy or F1. Moreover, human evaluation shows strong agreement with \textsf{HateXScore}, validating it as a practical tool for trustworthy and transparent moderation.

      <title>ButterflyMoE: Sub-Linear Ternary Experts via Structured Butterfly Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear memory scaling stores $N$ independent expert weight matrices requiring $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot d^2)$ memory, which exceeds edge devices memory budget. Current compression methods like quantization, pruning and low-rank factorization reduce constant factors but leave the scaling bottleneck unresolved. We introduce ButterflyMoE, a method that treats experts not as independent weight matrices but as geometric reorientations of a unified shared quantized substrate. Diversity among experts arises from viewing different angles of shared capacity, not from redundant storage. By applying learned rotations to a shared ternary prototype, each expert yields $\mathcal{O}(d^2 + N \cdot d \log d)$ memory -- sub-linear in the number of experts. The key insight: training these rotations with quantization reduces activation outliers and stabilizes extreme low bit training, where static methods collapse. Across language modeling benchmarks, ButterflyMoE achieves 150 times memory reduction at 256 experts with negligible accuracy loss. This allows 64 experts to fit on 4GB devices compared to standard MoE's 8 experts, showing geometric parametrization breaks linear scaling.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective fluorescent molecule design with a data-physics dual-driven generative framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing fluorescent small molecules with tailored optical and physicochemical properties requires navigating vast, underexplored chemical space while satisfying multiple objectives and constraints. Conventional generate-score-screen approaches become impractical under such realistic design specifications, owing to their low search efficiency, unreliable generalizability of machine-learning prediction, and the prohibitive cost of quantum chemical calculation. Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications. Overall, these results establish LUMOS as a data-physics dual-driven framework for general fluorophore inverse design.</description>

      <title>Self-Improvement as Coherence Optimization: A Theoretical Account</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can language models improve their accuracy without external supervision? Methods such as debate, bootstrap, and internal coherence maximization achieve this surprising feat, even matching golden finetuning performance. Yet why they work remains theoretically unclear. We show that they are all special cases of coherence optimization: finding a context-to-behavior mapping that's most compressible and jointly predictable. We prove that coherence optimization is equivalent to description-length regularization, and that among all such regularization schemes, it is optimal for semi-supervised learning when the regularizer is derived from a pretrained model. Our theory, supported by preliminary experiments, explains why feedback-free self-improvement works and predicts when it should succeed or fail.</description>

      <title>GeoDynamics: A Geometric State-Space Neural Network for Understanding Brain Dynamics on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have become a cornerstone for unraveling brain dynamics, revealing how latent neural states evolve over time and give rise to observed signals. By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism. Beyond neuroscience, we validate GeoDynamics on human action recognition benchmarks (UTKinect, Florence, HDM05), demonstrating its scalability and robustness in modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Neural Organ Transplantation (NOT): Checkpoint-Based Modular Adaptation for Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Neural Organ Transplantation (NOT), a modular adaptation framework that enables trained transformer layers to function as reusable transferable checkpoints for domain adaptation. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets ("donor organs") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness.</description>

      <title>TREX: Tokenizer Regression for Optimal Data Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building effective tokenizers for multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) requires careful control over language-specific data mixtures. While a tokenizer's compression performance critically affects the efficiency of LLM training and inference, existing approaches rely on heuristics or costly large-scale searches to determine optimal language ratios. We introduce Tokenizer Regression for Optimal Data MiXture (TREX), a regression-based framework that efficiently predicts the optimal data mixture for tokenizer training. TREX trains small-scale proxy tokenizers on random mixtures, gathers their compression statistics, and learns to predict compression performance from data mixtures. This learned model enables scalable mixture search before large-scale tokenizer training, mitigating the accuracy-cost trade-off in multilingual tokenizer design. Tokenizers trained with TReX's predicted mixtures outperform mixtures based on LLaMA3 and uniform distributions by up to 12% in both inand out-of-distribution compression efficiency, demonstrating strong scalability, robustness, and practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability of LLMs' Belief Systems? LLMs Belief Resistance Check Through Strategic Persuasive Conversation Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in various question-answering tasks. However, recent studies showcase that LLMs are susceptible to persuasion and could adopt counterfactual beliefs. We present a systematic evaluation of LLM susceptibility to persuasion under the Source--Message--Channel--Receiver (SMCR) communication framework. Across five mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) and three domains (factual knowledge, medical QA, and social bias), we analyze how different persuasive strategies influence belief stability over multiple interaction turns. We further examine whether meta-cognition prompting (i.e., eliciting self-reported confidence) affects resistance to persuasion. Results show that smaller models exhibit extreme compliance, with over 80% of belief changes occurring at the first persuasive turn (average end turn of 1.1--1.4). Contrary to expectations, meta-cognition prompting increases vulnerability by accelerating belief erosion rather than enhancing robustness. Finally, we evaluate adversarial fine-tuning as a defense. While GPT-4o-mini achieves near-complete robustness (98.6%) and Mistral~7B improves substantially (35.7% $\rightarrow$ 79.3%), Llama models remain highly susceptible (&lt;14%) even when fine-tuned on their own failure cases. Together, these findings highlight substantial model-dependent limits of current robustness interventions and offer guidance for developing more trustworthy LLMs.</description>

      <title>Machine learning based radiative parameterization scheme and its performance in operational reforecast experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation is typically the most time-consuming physical process in numerical models. One solution is to use machine learning methods to simulate the radiation process to improve computational efficiency. From an operational standpoint, this study investigates critical limitations inherent to hybrid forecasting frameworks that embed deep neural networks into numerical prediction models, with a specific focus on two fundamental bottlenecks: coupling compatibility and long-term integration stability. A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations. The hybrid model is capable of performing ten-day integrated forecasts as required. A two-month operational reforecast experiment demonstrates that the machine learning emulator achieves accuracy comparable to that of the traditional physical scheme, while accelerating the computation speed by approximately eightfold.</description>

      <title>Diffusion In Diffusion: Breaking the Autoregressive Bottleneck in Block Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Block diffusion language models, operating as semi-autoregressive paradigms, combine the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion paradigms. However, their strict unidirectional block dependencies introduce irreversibility and sacrifice the global planning capabilities for which diffusion models are renowned. In order to address these issues, we propose Diffusion in Diffusion, a draft-then-refine framework designed to overcome the irreversibility and myopia problems inherent in block diffusion models. Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilise snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset. Using just 26% of the fine-tuning budget of baseline models, we reduce generative perplexity from 25.7 to 21.9, significantly narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models.</description>

      <title>CauScientist: Teaching LLMs to Respect Data for Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific understanding and reliable decision-making. Existing approaches face critical limitations: purely data-driven methods suffer from statistical indistinguishability and modeling assumptions, while recent LLM-based methods either ignore statistical evidence or incorporate unverified priors that can mislead result. To this end, we propose CauScientist, a collaborative framework that synergizes LLMs as hypothesis-generating "data scientists" with probabilistic statistics as rigorous "verifiers". CauScientist employs hybrid initialization to select superior starting graphs, iteratively refines structures through LLM-proposed modifications validated by statistical criteria, and maintains error memory to guide efficient search space. Experiments demonstrate that CauScientist substantially outperforms purely data-driven baselines, achieving up to 53.8% F1 score improvement and enhancing recall from 35.0% to 100.0%. Notably, while standalone LLM performance degrades with graph complexity, CauScientist reduces structural hamming distance (SHD) by 44.0% compared to Qwen3-32B on 37-node graphs.

      <title>CARPE: Context-Aware Image Representation Prioritization via Ensemble for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have pushed them closer to becoming general-purpose assistants. Despite their strong performance, LVLMs still struggle with vision-centric tasks such as image classification, underperforming compared to their base vision encoders, which are often CLIP-based models. To address this limitation, we propose Context-Aware Image Representation Prioritization via Ensemble (CARPE), a novel, model-agnostic framework which introduces vision-integration layers and a context-aware ensemble strategy to identify when to prioritize image representations or rely on the reasoning capabilities of the language model. This design enhances the model's ability to adaptively weight visual and textual modalities and enables the model to capture various aspects of image representations, leading to consistent improvements in generalization across classification and vision-language benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARPE not only improves performance on image classification benchmarks but also enhances results across various vision-language benchmarks. Finally, CARPE is designed to be effectively integrated with most open-source LVLMs that consist of a vision encoder and a language model, ensuring its adaptability across diverse architectures.</description>

Abstract: Fast adversarial training (FAT) aims to enhance the robustness of models against adversarial attacks with reduced training time, however, FAT often suffers from compromised robustness due to insufficient exploration of adversarial space. In this paper, we develop a loss function to mitigate the problem of degraded robustness under FAT. Specifically, we derive a quadratic upper bound (QUB) on the adversarial training (AT) loss function and propose to utilize the bound with existing FAT methods. Our experimental results show that applying QUB loss to the existing methods yields significant improvement of robustness. Furthermore, using various metrics, we demonstrate that this improvement is likely to result from the smoothened loss landscape of the resulting model.</description>

      <title>Fusion Segment Transformer: Bi-Directional Attention Guided Fusion Network for AI-Generated Music Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of generative AI technology, anyone can now easily create and deploy AI-generated music, which has heightened the need for technical solutions to address copyright and ownership issues. While existing works mainly focused on short-audio, the challenge of full-audio detection, which requires modeling long-term structure and context, remains insufficiently explored. To address this, we propose an improved version of the Segment Transformer, termed the Fusion Segment Transformer. As in our previous work, we extract content embeddings from short music segments using diverse feature extractors. Furthermore, we enhance the architecture for full-audio AI-generated music detection by introducing a Gated Fusion Layer that effectively integrates content and structural information, enabling the capture of long-term context. Experiments on the SONICS and AIME datasets show that our approach outperforms the previous model and recent baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in AI-generated music detection.</description>

      <title>Fairness or Fluency? An Investigation into Language Bias of Pairwise LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have incentivized the development of LLM-as-a-judge, an application of LLMs where they are used as judges to decide the quality of a certain piece of text given a certain context. However, previous studies have demonstrated that LLM-as-a-judge can be biased towards different aspects of the judged texts, which often do not align with human preference. One of the identified biases is language bias, which indicates that the decision of LLM-as-a-judge can differ based on the language of the judged texts. In this paper, we study two types of language bias in pairwise LLM-as-a-judge: (1) performance disparity between languages when the judge is prompted to compare options from the same language, and (2) bias towards options written in major languages when the judge is prompted to compare options of two different languages. We find that for same-language judging, there exist significant performance disparities across language families, with European languages consistently outperforming African languages, and this bias is more pronounced in culturally-related subjects. For inter-language judging, we observe that most models favor English answers, and that this preference is influenced more by answer language than question language. Finally, we investigate whether language bias is in fact caused by low-perplexity bias, a previously identified bias of LLM-as-a-judge, and we find that while perplexity is slightly correlated with language bias, language bias cannot be fully explained by perplexity only.</description>

      <title>Why Does the LLM Stop Computing: An Empirical Study of User-Reported Failures in Open-Source LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The democratization of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) allows users to fine-tune and deploy models on local infrastructure but exposes them to a First Mile deployment landscape. Unlike black-box API consumption, the reliability of user-managed orchestration remains a critical blind spot. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 705 real-world failures from the open-source DeepSeek, Llama, and Qwen ecosystems.
  Our analysis reveals a paradigm shift: white-box orchestration relocates the reliability bottleneck from model algorithmic defects to the systemic fragility of the deployment stack. We identify three key phenomena: (1) Diagnostic Divergence: runtime crashes distinctively signal infrastructure friction, whereas incorrect functionality serves as a signature for internal tokenizer defects. (2) Systemic Homogeneity: Root causes converge across divergent series, confirming reliability barriers are inherent to the shared ecosystem rather than specific architectures. (3) Lifecycle Escalation: Barriers escalate from intrinsic configuration struggles during fine-tuning to compounded environmental incompatibilities during inference. Supported by our publicly available dataset, these insights provide actionable guidance for enhancing the reliability of the LLM landscape.</description>

      <title>Communication-Free Collective Navigation for a Swarm of UAVs via LiDAR-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based controller for collective navigation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in communication-denied environments, enabling robust operation in complex, obstacle-rich environments. Inspired by biological swarms where informed individuals guide groups without explicit communication, we employ an implicit leader-follower framework. In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act: Disentangled Representation Learning for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis integrates Linguistic, Visual, and Acoustic. Mainstream approaches based on modality-invariant and modality-specific factorization or on complex fusion still rely on spatiotemporal mixed modeling. This ignores spatiotemporal heterogeneity, leading to spatiotemporal information asymmetry and thus limited performance. Hence, we propose TSDA, Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act, which explicitly decouples each modality into temporal dynamics and spatial structural context before any interaction. For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts. Factor specific supervision and decorrelation regularization reduce cross factor leakage while preserving complementarity. A Gated Recouple module subsequently recouples the aligned streams for task. Extensive experiments show that TSDA outperforms baselines. Ablation analysis studies confirm the necessity and interpretability of the design.</description>

      <title>The Orchestration of Multi-Agent Systems: Architectures, Protocols, and Enterprise Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orchestrated multi-agent systems represent the next stage in the evolution of artificial intelligence, where autonomous agents collaborate through structured coordination and communication to achieve complex, shared objectives. This paper consolidates and formalizes the technical composition of such systems, presenting a unified architectural framework that integrates planning, policy enforcement, state management, and quality operations into a coherent orchestration layer. Another primary contribution of this work is the in-depth technical delineation of two complementary communication protocols - the Model Context Protocol, which standardizes how agents access external tools and contextual data, and the Agent2Agent protocol, which governs peer coordination, negotiation, and delegation. Together, these protocols establish an interoperable communication substrate that enables scalable, auditable, and policy-compliant reasoning across distributed agent collectives. Beyond protocol design, the paper details how orchestration logic, governance frameworks, and observability mechanisms collectively sustain system coherence, transparency, and accountability. By synthesizing these elements into a cohesive technical blueprint, this paper provides comprehensive treatments of orchestrated multi-agent systems - bridging conceptual architectures with implementation-ready design principles for enterprise-scale AI ecosystems.</description>

      <title>HeteroCache: A Dynamic Retrieval Approach to Heterogeneous KV Cache Compression for Long-Context LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear memory growth of the KV cache poses a significant bottleneck for LLM inference in long-context tasks. Existing static compression methods often fail to preserve globally important information, principally because they overlook the attention drift phenomenon where token significance evolves dynamically. Although recent dynamic retrieval approaches attempt to address this issue, they typically suffer from coarse-grained caching strategies and incur high I/O overhead due to frequent data transfers. To overcome these limitations, we propose HeteroCache, a training-free dynamic compression framework. Our method is built on two key insights: attention heads exhibit diverse temporal heterogeneity, and there is significant spatial redundancy among heads within the same layer. Guided by these insights, HeteroCache categorizes heads based on stability and redundancy. Consequently, we apply a fine-grained weighting strategy that allocates larger cache budgets to heads with rapidly shifting attention to capture context changes, thereby addressing the inefficiency of coarse-grained strategies. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical storage mechanism in which a subset of representative heads monitors attention shift, and trigger an asynchronous, on-demand retrieval of contexts from the CPU, effectively hiding I/O latency. Finally, experiments demonstrate that HeteroCache achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-context benchmarks and accelerates decoding by up to $3\times$ compared to the original model in the 224K context. Our code will be open-source.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Reverse Screening Identifies Protein Targets of Small Molecules Using HelixFold3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying protein targets for small molecules, or reverse screening, is essential for understanding drug action, guiding compound repurposing, predicting off-target effects, and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of bioactive compounds. Despite its critical role, reverse screening remains challenging because accurately capturing interactions between a small molecule and structurally diverse proteins is inherently complex, and conventional step-wise workflows often propagate errors across decoupled steps such as target structure modeling, pocket identification, docking, and scoring. Here, we present an end-to-end reverse screening strategy leveraging HelixFold3, a high-accuracy biomolecular structure prediction model akin to AlphaFold3, which simultaneously models the folding of proteins from a protein library and the docking of small-molecule ligands within a unified framework. We validate this approach on a diverse and representative set of approximately one hundred small molecules. Compared with conventional reverse docking, our method improves screening accuracy and demonstrates enhanced structural fidelity, binding-site precision, and target prioritization. By systematically linking small molecules to their protein targets, this framework establishes a scalable and straightforward platform for dissecting molecular mechanisms, exploring off-target interactions, and supporting rational drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Gradient Signal-to-Noise Data Selection for Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is a standard paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs), but modern instruction datasets are large, noisy, and redundant, making full-data fine-tuning costly and often unnecessary. Existing data selection methods either build expensive gradient datastores or assign static scores from a weak proxy, largely ignoring evolving uncertainty, and thus missing a key source of LLM interpretability. We propose GRADFILTERING, an objective-agnostic, uncertainty-aware data selection framework that utilizes a small GPT-2 proxy with a LoRA ensemble and aggregates per-example gradients into a Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (G-SNR) utility. Our method matches or surpasses random subsets and strong baselines in most LLM-as-a-judge evaluations as well as in human assessment. Moreover, GRADFILTERING-selected subsets converge faster than competitive filters under the same compute budget, reflecting the benefit of uncertainty-aware scoring.</description>

      <title>Does Privacy Always Harm Fairness? Data-Dependent Trade-offs via Chernoff Information Neural Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness and privacy are two vital pillars of trustworthy machine learning. Despite extensive research on these individual topics, the relationship between fairness and privacy has received significantly less attention. In this paper, we utilize the information-theoretic measure Chernoff Information to highlight the data-dependent nature of the relationship among the triad of fairness, privacy, and accuracy. We first define Noisy Chernoff Difference, a tool that allows us to analyze the relationship among the triad simultaneously. We then show that for synthetic data, this value behaves in 3 distinct ways (depending on the distribution of the data). We highlight the data distributions involved in these cases and explore their fairness and privacy implications. Additionally, we show that Noisy Chernoff Difference acts as a proxy for the steepness of the fairness-accuracy curves. Finally, we propose a method for estimating Chernoff Information on data from unknown distributions and utilize this framework to examine the triad dynamic on real datasets. This work builds towards a unified understanding of the fairness-privacy-accuracy relationship and highlights its data-dependent nature.</description>

      <title>Performance and Complexity Trade-off Optimization of Speech Models During Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In speech machine learning, neural network models are typically designed by choosing an architecture with fixed layer sizes and structure. These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing. The code related to our work is publicly available to encourage further research.</description>

      <title>Attention-space Contrastive Guidance for Efficient Hallucination Mitigation in LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often arise when language priors dominate over visual evidence, causing object misidentification and visually inconsistent descriptions. We address this issue by framing hallucination mitigation as contrastive guidance, steering generation toward visually grounded and semantically faithful text. This approach regulates the model's internal behavior by reducing over-dependence on language priors and contrasting visually grounded with language-only representations. We propose Attention-space Contrastive Guidance (ACG), a single-pass mechanism that operates within self-attention layers to construct both vision-language and language-only attention paths in a single forward computation. This integration enables computationally efficient guidance directly embedded in the model's representation contextualization. To correct approximation bias introduced by the single-pass formulation, we further apply an orthogonalized correction that removes components aligned with the language-only path, selectively amplifying visual contributions. Experiments on the CHAIR and POPE benchmarks show that ACG achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness and caption quality while significantly reducing computational cost. Our method establishes a principled and efficient alternative, reducing latency by up to 2x compared to prior contrastive decoding methods that require multiple forward passes.</description>

      <title>Who Should Have Surgery? A Comparative Study of GenAI vs Supervised ML for CRS Surgical Outcome Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has reshaped medical imaging, yet the use of AI on clinical data for prospective decision support remains limited. We study pre-operative prediction of clinically meaningful improvement in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), defining success as a more than 8.9-point reduction in SNOT-22 at 6 months (MCID). In a prospectively collected cohort where all patients underwent surgery, we ask whether models using only pre-operative clinical data could have identified those who would have poor outcomes, i.e. those who should have avoided surgery. We benchmark supervised ML (logistic regression, tree ensembles, and an in-house MLP) against generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), giving each the same structured inputs and constraining outputs to binary recommendations with confidence. Our best ML model (MLP) achieves 85 % accuracy with superior calibration and decision-curve net benefit. GenAI models underperform on discrimination and calibration across zero-shot setting. Notably, GenAI justifications align with clinician heuristics and the MLP's feature importance, repeatedly highlighting baseline SNOT-22, CT/endoscopy severity, polyp phenotype, and physchology/pain comorbidities. We provide a reproducible tabular-to-GenAI evaluation protocol and subgroup analyses. Findings support an ML-first, GenAI- augmented workflow: deploy calibrated ML for primary triage of surgical candidacy, with GenAI as an explainer to enhance transparency and shared decision-making.</description>

      <title>Simulated Ignorance Fails: A Systematic Study of LLM Behaviors on Forecasting Problems Before Model Knowledge Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating LLM forecasting capabilities is constrained by a fundamental tension: prospective evaluation offers methodological rigor but prohibitive latency, while retrospective forecasting (RF) -- evaluating on already-resolved events -- faces rapidly shrinking clean evaluation data as SOTA models possess increasingly recent knowledge cutoffs. Simulated Ignorance (SI), prompting models to suppress pre-cutoff knowledge, has emerged as a potential solution. We provide the first systematic test of whether SI can approximate True Ignorance (TI). Across 477 competition-level questions and 9 models, we find that SI fails systematically: (1) cutoff instructions leave a 52% performance gap between SI and TI; (2) chain-of-thought reasoning fails to suppress prior knowledge, even when reasoning traces contain no explicit post-cutoff references; (3) reasoning-optimized models exhibit worse SI fidelity despite superior reasoning trace quality. These findings demonstrate that prompts cannot reliably "rewind" model knowledge. We conclude that RF on pre-cutoff events is methodologically flawed; we recommend against using SI-based retrospective setups to benchmark forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Long Video Understanding with Audiovisual Entity Cohesion and Agentic Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long video understanding presents significant challenges for vision-language models due to extremely long context windows. Existing solutions relying on naive chunking strategies with retrieval-augmented generation, typically suffer from information fragmentation and a loss of global coherence. We present HAVEN, a unified framework for long-video understanding that enables coherent and comprehensive reasoning by integrating audiovisual entity cohesion and hierarchical video indexing with agentic search. First, we preserve semantic consistency by integrating entity-level representations across visual and auditory streams, while organizing content into a structured hierarchy spanning global summary, scene, segment, and entity levels. Then we employ an agentic search mechanism to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning across these layers, facilitating coherent narrative reconstruction and fine-grained entity tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves good temporal coherence, entity consistency, and retrieval efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an overall accuracy of 84.1% on LVBench. Notably, it achieves outstanding performance in the challenging reasoning category, reaching 80.1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured, multimodal reasoning for comprehensive and context-consistent understanding of long-form videos.</description>

      <title>OP-Bench: Benchmarking Over-Personalization for Memory-Augmented Personalized Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory-augmented conversational agents enable personalized interactions using long-term user memory and have gained substantial traction. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on whether agents can recall and apply user information, while overlooking whether such personalization is used appropriately. In fact, agents may overuse personal information, producing responses that feel forced, intrusive, or socially inappropriate to users. We refer to this issue as \emph{over-personalization}. In this work, we formalize over-personalization into three types: Irrelevance, Repetition, and Sycophancy, and introduce \textbf{OP-Bench} a benchmark of 1,700 verified instances constructed from long-horizon dialogue histories. Using \textbf{OP-Bench}, we evaluate multiple large language models and memory-augmentation methods, and find that over-personalization is widespread when memory is introduced. Further analysis reveals that agents tend to retrieve and over-attend to user memories even when unnecessary. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{Self-ReCheck}, a lightweight, model-agnostic memory filtering mechanism that mitigates over-personalization while preserving personalization performance. Our work takes an initial step toward more controllable and appropriate personalization in memory-augmented dialogue systems.</description>

      <title>Towards robust long-context understanding of large language model via active recap learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose active recap learning (ARL), a framework for enhancing large language model (LLM) in understanding long contexts. ARL enables models to revisit and summarize earlier content through targeted sequence construction during contined pretraining and retrospective summarization at inference. First, we identify key tokens in prepared long context based on loss gaps between long and short forward contexts and find most revant preceding paragraphs, then summarize them using an LLM. Second, ARL equips models with the ability to autonomously generate and utilize these retrospective summaries during inference, thereby establishing a recursive memory mechanism across paragraphs. Experimental results show substantial gains, with ARL achieving a 26.8% improvement on RULER and a 9.44% improvement on LongBench. Overall, ARL offers a simple yet effective continued pretraining-based approach to strengthen long-context understanding, advancing scalable memory augmentation in LLM</description>

      <title>Pro-AI Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for decision-support across multiple domains. We investigate whether these models display a systematic preferential bias in favor of artificial intelligence (AI) itself. Across three complementary experiments, we find consistent evidence of pro-AI bias. First, we show that LLMs disproportionately recommend AI-related options in response to diverse advice-seeking queries, with proprietary models doing so almost deterministically. Second, we demonstrate that models systematically overestimate salaries for AI-related jobs relative to closely matched non-AI jobs, with proprietary models overestimating AI salaries more by 10 percentage points. Finally, probing internal representations of open-weight models reveals that ``Artificial Intelligence'' exhibits the highest similarity to generic prompts for academic fields under positive, negative, and neutral framings alike, indicating valence-invariant representational centrality. These patterns suggest that LLM-generated advice and valuation can systematically skew choices and perceptions in high-stakes decisions.</description>

      <title>vLinear: A Powerful Linear Model for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present \textbf{vLinear}, an effective yet efficient \textbf{linear}-based multivariate time series forecaster featuring two components: the \textbf{v}ecTrans module and the WFMLoss objective. Many state-of-the-art forecasters rely on self-attention or its variants to capture multivariate correlations, typically incurring $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ computational complexity with respect to the number of variates $N$. To address this, we propose vecTrans, a lightweight module that utilizes a learnable vector to model multivariate correlations, reducing the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Notably, vecTrans can be seamlessly integrated into Transformer-based forecasters, delivering up to 5$\times$ inference speedups and consistent performance gains. Furthermore, we introduce WFMLoss (Weighted Flow Matching Loss) as the objective. In contrast to typical \textbf{velocity-oriented} flow matching objectives, we demonstrate that a \textbf{final-series-oriented} formulation yields significantly superior forecasting accuracy. WFMLoss also incorporates path- and horizon-weighted strategies to focus learning on more reliable paths and horizons. Empirically, vLinear achieves state-of-the-art performance across 22 benchmarks and 124 forecasting settings. Moreover, WFMLoss serves as an effective plug-and-play objective, consistently improving existing forecasters. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/vLinear.</description>

      <title>Insight: Interpretable Semantic Hierarchies in Vision-Language Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language-aligned vision foundation models perform strongly across diverse downstream tasks. Yet, their learned representations remain opaque, making interpreting their decision-making hard. Recent works decompose these representations into human-interpretable concepts, but provide poor spatial grounding and are limited to image classification tasks. In this work, we propose Insight, a language-aligned concept foundation model that provides fine-grained concepts, which are human-interpretable and spatially grounded in the input image. We leverage a hierarchical sparse autoencoder and a foundation model with strong semantic representations to automatically extract concepts at various granularities. Examining local co-occurrence dependencies of concepts allows us to define concept relationships. Through these relations we further improve concept naming and obtain richer explanations. On benchmark data, we show that Insight provides performance on classification and segmentation that is competitive with opaque foundation models while providing fine-grained, high quality concept-based explanations.

      <title>DroneVLA: VLA based Aerial Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As aerial platforms evolve from passive observers to active manipulators, the challenge shifts toward designing intuitive interfaces that allow non-expert users to command these systems naturally. This work introduces a novel concept of autonomous aerial manipulation system capable of interpreting high-level natural language commands to retrieve objects and deliver them to a human user. The system is intended to integrate a MediaPipe based on Grounding DINO and a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a custom-built drone equipped with a 1-DOF gripper and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera. VLA performs semantic reasoning to interpret the intent of a user prompt and generates a prioritized task queue for grasping of relevant objects in the scene. Grounding DINO and dynamic A* planning algorithm are used to navigate and safely relocate the object. To ensure safe and natural interaction during the handover phase, the system employs a human-centric controller driven by MediaPipe. This module provides real-time human pose estimation, allowing the drone to employ visual servoing to maintain a stable, distinct position directly in front of the user, facilitating a comfortable handover. We demonstrate the system's efficacy through real-world experiments for localization and navigation, which resulted in a 0.164m, 0.070m, and 0.084m of max, mean euclidean, and root-mean squared errors, respectively, highlighting the feasibility of VLA for aerial manipulation operations.</description>

      <title>HardSecBench: Benchmarking the Security Awareness of LLMs for Hardware Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly integrated into practical hardware and firmware development pipelines for code generation. Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating the functional correctness of LLM-generated code, yet paid limited attention to its security issues. However, LLM-generated code that appears functionally sound may embed security flaws which could induce catastrophic damages after deployment. This critical research gap motivates us to design a benchmark for assessing security awareness under realistic specifications. In this work, we introduce HardSecBench, a benchmark with 924 tasks spanning Verilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) and firmware-level C, covering 76 hardware-relevant Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entries. Each task includes a structured specification, a secure reference implementation, and executable tests. To automate artifact synthesis, we propose a multi-agent pipeline that decouples synthesis from verification and grounds evaluation in execution evidence, enabling reliable evaluation. Using HardSecBench, we evaluate a range of LLMs on hardware and firmware code generation and find that models often satisfy functional requirements while still leaving security risks. We also find that security results vary with prompting. These findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in LLM-assisted hardware design. Our data and code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Confident Rankings with Fewer Items: Adaptive LLM Evaluation with Continuous Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has proven effective for efficient LLM evaluation on multiple-choice benchmarks, but modern LLM evaluation increasingly relies on generation tasks where outputs are scored continuously rather than marked correct/incorrect. We present a principled extension of IRT-based adaptive testing to continuous bounded scores (ROUGE, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge) by replacing the Bernoulli response distribution with a heteroskedastic normal distribution. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty aware ranker with adaptive stopping criteria that achieves reliable model ranking while testing as few items and as cheaply as possible. We validate our method on five benchmarks spanning n-gram-based, embedding-based, and LLM-as-judge metrics. Our method uses 2% of the items while improving ranking correlation by 0.12 {\tau} over random sampling, with 95% accuracy on confident predictions.</description>

      <title>OmniOVCD: Streamlining Open-Vocabulary Change Detection with SAM 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Change Detection (CD) is a fundamental task in remote sensing. It monitors the evolution of land cover over time. Based on this, Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) introduces a new requirement. It aims to reduce the reliance on predefined categories. Existing training-free OVCD methods mostly use CLIP to identify categories. These methods also need extra models like DINO to extract features. However, combining different models often causes problems in matching features and makes the system unstable. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) is introduced. It integrates segmentation and identification capabilities within one promptable model, which offers new possibilities for the OVCD task. In this paper, we propose OmniOVCD, a standalone framework designed for OVCD. By leveraging the decoupled output heads of SAM 3, we propose a Synergistic Fusion to Instance Decoupling (SFID) strategy. SFID first fuses the semantic, instance, and presence outputs of SAM 3 to construct land-cover masks, and then decomposes them into individual instance masks for change comparison. This design preserves high accuracy in category recognition and maintains instance-level consistency across images. As a result, the model can generate accurate change masks. Experiments on four public benchmarks (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, S2Looking, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 67.2, 66.5, 24.5, and 27.1 (class-average), respectively, surpassing all previous methods.</description>

      <title>TractRLFusion: A GPT-Based Multi-Critic Policy Fusion Framework for Fiber Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tractography plays a pivotal role in the non-invasive reconstruction of white matter fiber pathways, providing vital information on brain connectivity and supporting precise neurosurgical planning. Although traditional methods relied mainly on classical deterministic and probabilistic approaches, recent progress has benefited from supervised deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve tract reconstruction. A persistent challenge in tractography is accurately reconstructing white matter tracts while minimizing spurious connections. To address this, we propose TractRLFusion, a novel GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple RL policies through a data-driven fusion strategy. Our method employs a two-stage training data selection process for effective policy fusion, followed by a multi-critic fine-tuning phase to enhance robustness and generalization. Experiments on HCP, ISMRM, and TractoInferno datasets demonstrate that TractRLFusion outperforms individual RL policies as well as state-of-the-art classical and DRL methods in accuracy and anatomical reliability.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric regularization mechanism for GAN training with Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the training of generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a Nash equilibrium seeking problem. To stabilize the training process and find a Nash equilibrium, we propose an asymmetric regularization mechanism based on the classic Tikhonov step and on a novel zero-centered gradient penalty. Under smoothness and a local identifiability condition induced by a Gauss-Newton Gramian, we obtain explicit Lipschitz and (strong)-monotonicity constants for the regularized operator. These constants ensure last-iterate linear convergence of a single-call Extrapolation-from-the-Past (EFTP) method. Empirical simulations on an academic example show that, even when strong monotonicity cannot be achieved, the asymmetric regularization is enough to converge to an equilibrium and stabilize the trajectory.</description>

      <title>IF-GEO: Conflict-Aware Instruction Fusion for Multi-Query Generative Engine Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Generative Engines revolutionize information retrieval by synthesizing direct answers from retrieved sources, ensuring source visibility becomes a significant challenge. Improving it through targeted content revisions is a practical strategy termed Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). However, optimizing a document for diverse queries presents a constrained optimization challenge where heterogeneous queries often impose conflicting and competing revision requirements under a limited content budget. To address this challenge, we propose IF-GEO, a "diverge-then-converge" framework comprising two phases: (i) mining distinct optimization preferences from representative latent queries; (ii) synthesizing a Global Revision Blueprint for guided editing by coordinating preferences via conflict-aware instruction fusion. To explicitly quantify IF-GEO's objective of cross-query stability, we introduce risk-aware stability metrics. Experiments on multi-query benchmarks demonstrate that IF-GEO achieves substantial performance gains while maintaining robustness across diverse retrieval scenarios.</description>

      <title>Glance-or-Gaze: Incentivizing LMMs to Adaptively Focus Search via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable success in visual understanding, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive queries involving long-tail entities or evolving information due to static parametric knowledge. Recent search-augmented approaches attempt to address this limitation, but existing methods rely on indiscriminate whole-image retrieval that introduces substantial visual redundancy and noise, and lack deep iterative reflection, limiting their effectiveness on complex visual queries. To overcome these challenges, we propose Glance-or-Gaze (GoG), a fully autonomous framework that shifts from passive perception to active visual planning. GoG introduces a Selective Gaze mechanism that dynamically chooses whether to glance at global context or gaze into high-value regions, filtering irrelevant information before retrieval. We design a dual-stage training strategy: Reflective GoG Behavior Alignment via supervised fine-tuning instills the fundamental GoG paradigm, while Complexity-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning further enhances the model's capability to handle complex queries through iterative reasoning. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies confirm that both Selective Gaze and complexity-adaptive RL are essential for effective visual search. We will release our data and models for further exploration soon.</description>

      <title>Stream-Voice-Anon: Enhancing Utility of Real-Time Speaker Anonymization via Neural Audio Codec and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting speaker identity is crucial for online voice applications, yet streaming speaker anonymization (SA) remains underexplored. Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios. Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers.</description>

      <title>RL-BioAug: Label-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Self-Supervised EEG Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of data augmentation serves as a critical determinant for the performance of contrastive learning in EEG tasks. Although this paradigm is promising for utilizing unlabeled data, static or random augmentation strategies often fail to preserve intrinsic information due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals where statistical properties change over time. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10\%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69\% and 8.80\% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Notably, this agent mainly chose optimal strategies for each task -- for example, Time Masking with a 62\% probability for sleep stage classification and Crop \&amp; Resize with a 77\% probability for seizure detection. Our framework suggests its potential to replace conventional heuristic-based augmentations and establish a new autonomous paradigm for data augmentation.

      <title>"The Whole Is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts": A Compatibility-Aware Multi-Teacher CoT Distillation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable capabilities but typically requires prohibitive parameter scales. CoT distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm to transfer reasoning prowess into compact Student Models (SLMs), but existing approaches often rely on a solitary teacher, capping the student's potential since individual LLMs often exhibit distinct capability biases and may suffer from catastrophic forgetting. While leveraging diverse teachers seems appealing, effectively fusing their supervisions remains challenging: teacher-student incompatibility risks amplifying hallucinations, and passive supervision fails to ensure genuine logic internalization. To address this, we introduce COMPACT, a framework that adaptively fuses supervisions from different teachers by dynamically weighting teacher gradients based on the student's real-time compatibility evaluated by a multi-dimensional metric: (1) Graph-based Consensus to filter misleading rationales by identifying mainstream reasoning paths; (2) Mutual-Information-based Adaptability to detect "epiphany moments" for genuinely understanding the reasoning process rather than merely imitating; and (3) Loss-based Difficulty to assess student receptivity to the teacher's guidance and prevent negative transfer. Extensive experiments and latent space analysis demonstrate that COMPACT effectively integrates diverse reasoning capabilities without damaging the model's original knowledge structure, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.</description>

The library addresses three fundamental challenges: (1) GPU acceleration for sparse linear solves, nonlinear solves (Newton, Picard, Anderson), and eigenvalue computation; (2) Multi-GPU scaling via domain decomposition with halo exchange, reaching \textbf{400 million DOF linear solve on 3 GPUs}; and (3) Adjoint-based differentiation} achieving $\mathcal{O}(1)$ computational graph nodes (for autograd) and $\mathcal{O}(\text{nnz})$ memory -- independent of solver iterations. \torchsla{} supports multiple backends (SciPy, cuDSS, PyTorch-native) and seamlessly integrates with PyTorch autograd for end-to-end differentiable simulations.

      <title>DAME: Duration-Aware Matryoshka Embedding for Duration-Robust Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-utterance speaker verification remains challenging due to limited speaker-discriminative cues in short speech segments. While existing methods focus on enhancing speaker encoders, the embedding learning strategy still forces a single fixed-dimensional representation reused for utterances of any length, leaving capacity misaligned with the information available at different durations. We propose Duration-Aware Matryoshka Embedding (DAME), a model-agnostic framework that builds a nested hierarchy of sub-embeddings aligned to utterance durations: lower-dimensional representations capture compact speaker traits from short utterances, while higher dimensions encode richer details from longer speech. DAME supports both training from scratch and fine-tuning, and serves as a direct alternative to conventional large-margin fine-tuning, consistently improving performance across durations. On the VoxCeleb1-O/E/H and VOiCES evaluation sets, DAME consistently reduces the equal error rate on 1-s and other short-duration trials, while maintaining full-length performance with no additional inference cost. These gains generalize across various speaker encoder architectures under both general training and fine-tuning setups.</description>

      <title>MATE: Matryoshka Audio-Text Embeddings for Open-Vocabulary Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS) with text-based enrollment has emerged as a flexible alternative to fixed-phrase triggers. Prior utterance-level matching methods, from an embedding-learning standpoint, learn embeddings at a single fixed dimensionality. We depart from this design and propose Matryoshka Audio-Text Embeddings (MATE), a dual-encoder framework that encodes multiple embedding granularities within a single vector via nested sub-embeddings ("prefixes"). Specifically, we introduce a PCA-guided prefix alignment: PCA-compressed versions of the full text embedding for each prefix size serve as teacher targets to align both audio and text prefixes. This alignment concentrates salient keyword cues in lower-dimensional prefixes, while higher dimensions add detail. MATE is trained with standard deep metric learning objectives for audio-text KWS, and is loss-agnostic. To our knowledge, this is the first application of matryoshka-style embeddings to KWS, achieving state-of-the-art results on WSJ and LibriPhrase without any inference overhead.</description>

      <title>Credible CO2 Comparisons: A Machine Learning Approach to Vehicle Powertrain Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decarbonizing road transport requires consistent and transparent methods for comparing CO2 emissions across vehicle technologies. This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for like-for-like operational assessment of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) under identical, real-world driving conditions. The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies. It offers a scalable foundation for credible, data-driven assessments of vehicle carbon performance under real-world operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Abstention for Noise-Robust Learning in Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Label noise is a critical problem in medical image segmentation, often arising from the inherent difficulty of manual annotation. Models trained on noisy data are prone to overfitting, which degrades their generalization performance. While a number of methods and strategies have been proposed to mitigate noisy labels in the segmentation domain, this area remains largely under-explored. The abstention mechanism has proven effective in classification tasks by enhancing the capabilities of Cross Entropy, yet its potential in segmentation remains unverified. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a universal and modular abstention framework capable of enhancing the noise-robustness of a diverse range of loss functions. Our framework improves upon prior work with two key components: an informed regularization term to guide abstention behaviour, and a more flexible power-law-based auto-tuning algorithm for the abstention penalty. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by systematically integrating it with three distinct loss functions to create three novel, noise-robust variants: GAC, SAC, and ADS. Experiments on the CaDIS and DSAD medical datasets show our methods consistently and significantly outperform their non-abstaining baselines, especially under high noise levels. This work establishes that enabling models to selectively ignore corrupted samples is a powerful and generalizable strategy for building more reliable segmentation models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/wemous/abstention-for-segmentation.</description>

      <title>Top 10 Open Challenges Steering the Future of Diffusion Language Model and Its Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) is currently defined by auto-regressive (AR) architectures, which generate text through a sequential ``brick-by-brick'' process. Despite their success, AR models are inherently constrained by a causal bottleneck that limits global structural foresight and iterative refinement. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a transformative alternative, conceptualizing text generation as a holistic, bidirectional denoising process akin to a sculptor refining a masterpiece. However, the potential of DLMs remains largely untapped as they are frequently confined within AR-legacy infrastructures and optimization frameworks. In this Perspective, we identify ten fundamental challenges ranging from architectural inertia and gradient sparsity to the limitations of linear reasoning that prevent DLMs from reaching their ``GPT-4 moment''. We propose a strategic roadmap organized into four pillars: foundational infrastructure, algorithmic optimization, cognitive reasoning, and unified multimodal intelligence. By shifting toward a diffusion-native ecosystem characterized by multi-scale tokenization, active remasking, and latent thinking, we can move beyond the constraints of the causal horizon. We argue that this transition is essential for developing next-generation AI capable of complex structural reasoning, dynamic self-correction, and seamless multimodal integration.</description>

      <title>Collective intelligence in science: direct elicitation of diverse information from experts with unknown information structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose we need a deep collective analysis of an open scientific problem: there is a complex scientific hypothesis and a large online group of mutually unrelated experts with relevant private information of a diverse and unpredictable nature. This information may be results of experts' individual experiments, original reasoning of some of them, results of AI systems they use, etc. We propose a simple mechanism based on a self-resolving play-money prediction market entangled with a chat. We show that such a system can easily be brought to an equilibrium where participants directly share their private information on the hypothesis through the chat and trade as if the market were resolved in accordance with the truth of the hypothesis. This approach will lead to efficient aggregation of relevant information in a completely interpretable form even if the ground truth cannot be established and experts initially know nothing about each other and cannot perform complex Bayesian calculations. Finally, by rewarding the experts with some real assets proportionally to the play money they end up with, we can get an innovative way to fund large-scale collaborative studies of any type.</description>

Abstract: We present Kakugo, a novel and cost-effective pipeline designed to train general-purpose Small Language Models (SLMs) for low-resource languages using only the language name as input. By using a large teacher model to generate synthetic prompts and translate instruction datasets, we produced training data and SLMs for 54 low-resource languages. Evaluations across a diverse set of general natural language processing tasks, including translation, classification, and question answering, demonstrate that our pipeline consistently improves performance over base models. With a total generation and training cost of under $50 per language, Kakugo offers an accessible method for communities to develop language-specific AI.</description>

      <title>LLMOrbit: A Circular Taxonomy of Large Language Models -From Scaling Walls to Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence has undergone a revolution from foundational Transformer architectures to reasoning-capable systems approaching human-level performance. We present LLMOrbit, a comprehensive circular taxonomy navigating the landscape of large language models spanning 2019-2025. This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at &lt;$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%). We provide insights into techniques (RLHF, PPO, DPO, GRPO, ORPO), trace evolution from passive generation to tool-using agents (ReAct, RAG, multi-agent systems), and analyze post-training innovations.</description>

      <title>Decoder-Free Supervoxel GNN for Accurate Brain-Tumor Localization in Multi-Modal MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern vision backbones for 3D medical imaging typically process dense voxel grids through parameter-heavy encoder-decoder structures, a design that allocates a significant portion of its parameters to spatial reconstruction rather than feature learning. Our approach introduces SVGFormer, a decoder-free pipeline built upon a content-aware grouping stage that partitions the volume into a semantic graph of supervoxels. Its hierarchical encoder learns rich node representations by combining a patch-level Transformer with a supervoxel-level Graph Attention Network, jointly modeling fine-grained intra-region features and broader inter-regional dependencies. This design concentrates all learnable capacity on feature encoding and provides inherent, dual-scale explainability from the patch to the region level. To validate the framework's flexibility, we trained two specialized models on the BraTS dataset: one for node-level classification and one for tumor proportion regression. Both models achieved strong performance, with the classification model achieving a F1-score of 0.875 and the regression model a MAE of 0.028, confirming the encoder's ability to learn discriminative and localized features. Our results establish that a graph-based, encoder-only paradigm offers an accurate and inherently interpretable alternative for 3D medical image representation.</description>

      <title>POCI-Diff: Position Objects Consistently and Interactively with 3D-Layout Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a diffusion-based approach for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation with consistent and interactive 3D layout control and editing. While prior methods improve spatial adherence using 2D cues or iterative copy-warp-paste strategies, they often distort object geometry and fail to preserve consistency across edits. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework for Positioning Objects Consistently and Interactively (POCI-Diff), a novel formulation for jointly enforcing 3D geometric constraints and instance-level semantic binding within a unified diffusion process. Our method enables explicit per-object semantic control by binding individual text descriptions to specific 3D bounding boxes through Blended Latent Diffusion, allowing one-shot synthesis of complex multi-object scenes. We further propose a warping-free generative editing pipeline that supports object insertion, removal, and transformation via regeneration rather than pixel deformation. To preserve object identity and consistency across edits, we condition the diffusion process on reference images using IP-Adapter, enabling coherent object appearance throughout interactive 3D editing while maintaining global scene coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that POCI-Diff produces high-quality images consistent with the specified 3D layouts and edits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and layout adherence while eliminating warping-induced geometric artifacts.</description>

      <title>XCR-Bench: A Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating Cultural Reasoning in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-cultural competence in large language models (LLMs) requires the ability to identify Culture-Specific Items (CSIs) and to adapt them appropriately across cultural contexts. Progress in evaluating this capability has been constrained by the scarcity of high-quality CSI-annotated corpora with parallel cross-cultural sentence pairs. To address this limitation, we introduce XCR-Bench, a Cross(X)-Cultural Reasoning Benchmark consisting of 4.9k parallel sentences and 1,098 unique CSIs, spanning three distinct reasoning tasks with corresponding evaluation metrics. Our corpus integrates Newmark's CSI framework with Hall's Triad of Culture, enabling systematic analysis of cultural reasoning beyond surface-level artifacts and into semi-visible and invisible cultural elements such as social norms, beliefs, and values. Our findings show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit consistent weaknesses in identifying and adapting CSIs related to social etiquette and cultural reference. Additionally, we find evidence that LLMs encode regional and ethno-religious biases even within a single linguistic setting during cultural adaptation. We release our corpus and code to facilitate future research on cross-cultural NLP.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Video Class-Incremental Learning via Deep Embedded Clustering Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised video class incremental learning (uVCIL) represents an important learning paradigm for learning video information without forgetting, and without considering any data labels. Prior approaches have focused on supervised class-incremental learning, relying on using the knowledge of labels and task boundaries, which is costly, requires human annotation, or is simply not a realistic option. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to address the uVCIL. We first consider a deep feature extractor network, providing a set of representative video features during each task without assuming any class or task information. We then progressively build a series of deep clusters from the extracted features. During the successive task learning, the model updated from the previous task is used as an initial state in order to transfer knowledge to the current learning task. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2, by ignoring the labels from the supervised setting. Our approach significantly outperforms other baselines on all datasets.</description>

      <title>DermaBench: A Clinician-Annotated Benchmark Dataset for Dermatology Visual Question Answering and Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly important in medical applications; however, their evaluation in dermatology remains limited by datasets that focus primarily on image-level classification tasks such as lesion recognition. While valuable for recognition, such datasets cannot assess the full visual understanding, language grounding, and clinical reasoning capabilities of multimodal models. Visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks are required to evaluate how models interpret dermatological images, reason over fine-grained morphology, and generate clinically meaningful descriptions. We introduce DermaBench, a clinician-annotated dermatology VQA benchmark built on the Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset. DermaBench comprises 656 clinical images from 570 unique patients spanning Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI. Using a hierarchical annotation schema with 22 main questions (single-choice, multi-choice, and open-ended), expert dermatologists annotated each image for diagnosis, anatomic site, lesion morphology, distribution, surface features, color, and image quality, together with open-ended narrative descriptions and summaries, yielding approximately 14.474 VQA-style annotations. DermaBench is released as a metadata-only dataset to respect upstream licensing and is publicly available at Harvard Dataverse.</description>

Abstract: Motion representation plays an important role in video understanding and has many applications including action recognition, robot and autonomous guidance or others. Lately, transformer networks, through their self-attention mechanism capabilities, have proved their efficiency in many applications. In this study, we introduce a new two-stream transformer video classifier, which extracts spatio-temporal information from content and optical flow representing movement information. The proposed model identifies self-attention features across the joint optical flow and temporal frame domain and represents their relationships within the transformer encoder mechanism. The experimental results show that our proposed methodology provides excellent classification results on three well-known video datasets of human activities.</description>

      <title>'1'-bit Count-based Sorting Unit to Reduce Link Power in DNN Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interconnect power consumption remains a bottleneck in Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators. While ordering data based on '1'-bit counts can mitigate this via reduced switching activity, practical hardware sorting implementations remain underexplored. This work proposes the hardware implementation of a comparison-free sorting unit optimized for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By leveraging approximate computing to group population counts into coarse-grained buckets, our design achieves hardware area reductions while preserving the link power benefits of data reordering. Our approximate sorting unit achieves up to 35.4% area reduction while maintaining 19.50\% BT reduction compared to 20.42% of precise implementation.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot adaptable task planning for autonomous construction robots: a comparative study of lightweight single and multi-AI agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots are expected to play a major role in the future construction industry but face challenges due to high costs and difficulty adapting to dynamic tasks. This study explores the potential of foundation models to enhance the adaptability and generalizability of task planning in construction robots. Four models are proposed and implemented using lightweight, open-source large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). These models include one single agent and three multi-agent teams that collaborate to create robot action plans. The models are evaluated across three construction roles: Painter, Safety Inspector, and Floor Tiling. Results show that the four-agent team outperforms the state-of-the-art GPT-4o in most metrics while being ten times more cost-effective. Additionally, teams with three and four agents demonstrate the improved generalizability. By discussing how agent behaviors influence outputs, this study enhances the understanding of AI teams and supports future research in diverse unstructured environments beyond construction.</description>

      <title>Causal feature selection framework for stable soft sensor modeling based on time-delayed cross mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft sensor modeling plays a crucial role in process monitoring. Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected. Two real-world case studies show that TDCCM achieves the highest average performance, while TDPCM improves soft sensor stability and performance in the worst scenario. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dirge1/TDPCM.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid Time-Constant networks (LTCs), a type of continuous-time graph neural network, excel at modeling irregularly-sampled dynamics but are fundamentally confined to Euclidean space. This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

      <title>Style Transfer as Bias Mitigation: Diffusion Models for Synthetic Mental Health Text for Arabic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution for mitigating data scarcity and demographic bias in mental health analysis, yet existing approaches largely rely on pretrained large language models (LLMs), which may suffer from limited output diversity and propagate biases inherited from their training data. In this work, we propose a pretraining-free diffusion-based approach for synthetic text generation that frames bias mitigation as a style transfer problem. Using the CARMA Arabic mental health corpus, which exhibits a substantial gender imbalance, we focus on male-to-female style transfer to augment underrepresented female-authored content. We construct five datasets capturing varying linguistic and semantic aspects of gender expression in Arabic and train separate diffusion models for each setting. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate consistently high semantic fidelity between source and generated text, alongside meaningful surface-level stylistic divergence, while qualitative analysis confirms linguistically plausible gender transformations. Our results show that diffusion-based style transfer can generate high-entropy, semantically faithful synthetic data without reliance on pretrained LLMs, providing an effective and flexible framework for mitigating gender bias in sensitive, low-resource mental health domains.</description>

      <title>Lost in the Prompt Order: Revealing the Limitations of Causal Attention in Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit surprising sensitivity to the structure of the prompt, but the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation on a striking case: in multiple-choice question answering, placing context before the questions and options (CQO) outperforms the reverse order (QOC) by over 14%p, consistently over a wide range of models and datasets. Through systematic architectural analysis, we identify causal attention as the core mechanism: in QOC prompts, the causal mask prevents option tokens from attending to context, creating an information bottleneck where context becomes invisible to options.</description>

      <title>LLM Augmented Intervenable Multimodal Adaptor for Post-operative Complication Prediction in Lung Cancer Surgery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Postoperative complications remain a critical concern in clinical practice, adversely affecting patient outcomes and contributing to rising healthcare costs. We present MIRACLE, a deep learning architecture for prediction of risk of postoperative complications in lung cancer surgery by integrating preoperative clinical and radiological data. MIRACLE employs a hyperspherical embedding space fusion of heterogeneous inputs, enabling the extraction of robust, discriminative features from both structured clinical records and high-dimensional radiological images. To enhance transparency of prediction and clinical utility, we incorporate an interventional deep learning module in MIRACLE, that not only refines predictions but also provides interpretable and actionable insights, allowing domain experts to interactively adjust recommendations based on clinical expertise. We validate our approach on POC-L, a real-world dataset comprising 3,094 lung cancer patients who underwent surgery at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Our results demonstrate that MIRACLE outperforms various traditional machine learning models and contemporary large language models (LLM) variants alone, for personalized and explainable postoperative risk management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept-based interpretability methods like TCAV require clean, well-separated positive and negative examples for each concept. Existing music datasets lack this structure: tags are sparse, noisy, or ill-defined. We introduce ConceptCaps, a dataset of 23k music-caption-audio triplets with explicit labels from a 200-attribute taxonomy. Our pipeline separates semantic modeling from text generation: a VAE learns plausible attribute co-occurrence patterns, a fine-tuned LLM converts attribute lists into professional descriptions, and MusicGen synthesizes corresponding audio. This separation improves coherence and controllability over end-to-end approaches. We validate the dataset through audio-text alignment (CLAP), linguistic quality metrics (BERTScore, MAUVE), and TCAV analysis confirming that concept probes recover musically meaningful patterns. Dataset and code are available online.</description>

      <title>Domain-Adaptation through Synthetic Data: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for German Law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle in specialized domains such as legal reasoning due to limited expert knowledge, resulting in factually incorrect outputs or hallucinations. This paper presents an effective method for adapting advanced LLMs to German legal question answering through a novel synthetic data generation approach. In contrast to costly human-annotated resources or unreliable synthetic alternatives, our approach systematically produces high-quality, diverse, and legally accurate question-answer pairs directly from authoritative German statutes. Using rigorous automated filtering methods and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, we demonstrate that LLMs adapted with our synthetic dataset significantly outperform their baseline counterparts on German legal question answering tasks. Our results highlight the feasibility of using carefully designed synthetic data as a robust alternative to manual annotation in high-stakes, knowledge-intensive domains.</description>

      <title>Human Values in a Single Sentence: Moral Presence, Hierarchies, and Transformer Ensembles on the Schwartz Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study sentence-level identification of the 19 values in the Schwartz motivational continuum as a concrete formulation of human value detection in text. The setting - out-of-context sentences from news and political manifestos - features sparse moral cues and severe class imbalance. This combination makes fine-grained sentence-level value detection intrinsically difficult, even for strong modern neural models. We first operationalize a binary moral presence task ("does any value appear?") and show that it is learnable from single sentences (positive-class F1 $\approx$ 0.74 with calibrated thresholds). We then compare a presence-gated hierarchy to a direct multi-label classifier under matched compute, both based on DeBERTa-base and augmented with lightweight signals (prior-sentence context, LIWC-22/eMFD/MJD lexica, and topic features). The hierarchy does not outperform direct prediction, indicating that gate recall limits downstream gains. We also benchmark instruction-tuned LLMs - Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 8B, and Qwen 2.5 7B - in zero-/few-shot and QLoRA setups and build simple ensembles; a soft-vote supervised ensemble reaches macro-F1 0.332, significantly surpassing the best single supervised model and exceeding prior English-only baselines. Overall, in this scenario, lightweight signals and small ensembles yield the most reliable improvements, while hierarchical gating offers limited benefit. We argue that, under an 8 GB single-GPU constraint and at the 7-9B scale, carefully tuned supervised encoders remain a strong and compute-efficient baseline for structured human value detection, and we outline how richer value structure and sentence-in-document context could further improve performance.</description>

      <title>A model of errors in transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the error rate of LLMs on tasks like arithmetic that require a deterministic output, and repetitive processing of tokens drawn from a small set of alternatives. We argue that incorrect predictions arise when small errors in the attention mechanism accumulate to cross a threshold, and use this insight to derive a quantitative two-parameter relationship between the accuracy and the complexity of the task. The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases. Our model provides an alternative to suggestions that errors made by LLMs on long repetitive tasks indicate the ``collapse of reasoning'', or an inability to express ``compositional'' functions. Finally, we show how to construct prompts to reduce the error rate.</description>

      <title>InT: Self-Proposed Interventions Enable Credit Assignment in LLM Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective at improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b.</description>

      <title>MASCOT: Towards Multi-Agent Socio-Collaborative Companion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have recently emerged as promising socio-collaborative companions for emotional and cognitive support. However, these systems frequently suffer from persona collapse--where agents revert to generic, homogenized assistant behaviors--and social sycophancy, which produces redundant, non-constructive dialogue. We propose MASCOT, a generalizable framework for multi-perspective socio-collaborative companions. MASCOT introduces a novel bi-level optimization strategy to harmonize individual and collective behaviors: 1) Persona-Aware Behavioral Alignment, an RLAIF-driven pipeline that finetunes individual agents for strict persona fidelity to prevent identity loss; and 2) Collaborative Dialogue Optimization, a meta-policy guided by group-level rewards to ensure diverse and productive discourse. Extensive evaluations across psychological support and workplace domains demonstrate that MASCOT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of up to +14.1 in Persona Consistency and +10.6 in Social Contribution. Our framework provides a practical roadmap for engineering the next generation of socially intelligent multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>KAGE-Bench: Fast Known-Axis Visual Generalization Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pixel-based reinforcement learning agents often fail under purely visual distribution shift even when latent dynamics and rewards are unchanged, but existing benchmarks entangle multiple sources of shift and hinder systematic analysis. We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors.

      <title>Q-learning with Adjoint Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Q-learning with Adjoint Matching (QAM), a novel TD-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that tackles a long-standing challenge in continuous-action RL: efficient optimization of an expressive diffusion or flow-matching policy with respect to a parameterized Q-function. Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL.</description>

      <title>Opportunities in AI/ML for the Rubin LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce unprecedented volumes of heterogeneous astronomical data (images, catalogs, and alerts) that challenge traditional analysis pipelines. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful, scalable, and operationally reliable. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance. Finally, we discuss critical software, computing, data infrastructure, and human capital requirements for the successful deployment of these new methodologies, and consider associated risks and opportunities for broader coordination with external actors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the AI Productivity Index for Agents (APEX-Agents), a benchmark for assessing whether AI agents can execute long-horizon, cross-application tasks created by investment banking analysts, management consultants, and corporate lawyers. APEX-Agents requires agents to navigate realistic work environments with files and tools. We test eight agents for the leaderboard using Pass@1. Gemini 3 Flash (Thinking=High) achieves the highest score of 24.0%, followed by GPT-5.2 (Thinking=High), Claude Opus 4.5 (Thinking=High), and Gemini 3 Pro (Thinking=High). We open source the APEX-Agents benchmark (n=480) with all prompts, rubrics, gold outputs, files, and metadata. We also open-source Archipelago, our infrastructure for agent execution and evaluation.</description>

      <title>VideoMaMa: Mask-Guided Video Matting via Generative Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing video matting models to real-world videos remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of labeled data. To address this, we present Video Mask-to-Matte Model (VideoMaMa) that converts coarse segmentation masks into pixel accurate alpha mattes, by leveraging pretrained video diffusion models. VideoMaMa demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to real-world footage, even though it is trained solely on synthetic data. Building on this capability, we develop a scalable pseudo-labeling pipeline for large-scale video matting and construct the Matting Anything in Video (MA-V) dataset, which offers high-quality matting annotations for more than 50K real-world videos spanning diverse scenes and motions. To validate the effectiveness of this dataset, we fine-tune the SAM2 model on MA-V to obtain SAM2-Matte, which outperforms the same model trained on existing matting datasets in terms of robustness on in-the-wild videos. These findings emphasize the importance of large-scale pseudo-labeled video matting and showcase how generative priors and accessible segmentation cues can drive scalable progress in video matting research.</description>

      <title>AlphaMapleSAT: An MCTS-based Cube-and-Conquer SAT Solver for Hard Combinatorial Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces AlphaMapleSAT, a Cube-and-Conquer (CnC) parallel SAT solver that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with deductive feedback to efficiently solve challenging combinatorial SAT problems. Traditional lookahead cubing methods, used by solvers such as March, limit their search depth to reduce overhead often resulting in suboptimal partitions. By contrast, AlphaMapleSAT performs a deeper MCTS search guided by deductive rewards from SAT solvers. This approach enables informed exploration of the cubing space while keeping cubing costs low. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique via extensive evaluations against the widely used and established March cubing solver on three well-known challenging combinatorial benchmarks, including the minimum Kochen-Specker (KS) problem from quantum mechanics, the Murty-Simon Conjecture, and the Ramsey problems from extremal graph theory. We compare AlphaMapleSAT against March using different types of conquering solvers such as SAT Modulo Symmetries (SMS) and SAT+CAS, both built on top of the CaDiCaL SAT solver. We show that in all cases, there is a speedup in elapsed real time (wall clock time) ranging from 1.61x to 7.57x on a 128 core machine for the above-mentioned problems. We also perform cube-level and parallel scaling analysis over 32, 64, and 128 cores, which shows that AlphaMapleSAT outperforms March on all these settings. Our results show that deductively-guided MCTS search technique for cubing in CnC solvers can significantly outperform March on hard combinatorial problems.</description>

      <title>MedQA-CS: Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE)-Style Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Clinical Skills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) in healthcare require advanced clinical skills (CS), yet current benchmarks fail to evaluate these comprehensively. We introduce MedQA-CS, an AI-SCE framework inspired by medical education's Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), to address this gap. MedQA-CS evaluates LLMs through two instruction-following tasks, LLM-as-medical-student and LLM-as-CS-examiner, designed to reflect real clinical scenarios. Our contributions include developing MedQA-CS, a comprehensive evaluation framework with publicly available data and expert annotations, and providing the quantitative and qualitative assessment of LLMs as reliable judges in CS evaluation. Our experiments show that MedQA-CS is a more challenging benchmark for evaluating clinical skills than traditional multiple-choice QA benchmarks (e.g., MedQA). Combined with existing benchmarks, MedQA-CS enables a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' clinical capabilities for both open- and closed-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Worse than Zero-shot? A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16101v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to maintain consistent reasoning when exposed to misleading or conflicting evidence, especially in real-world domains such as politics, where information is polarized or selectively framed. Mainstream RAG benchmarks evaluate models under clean retrieval settings, where systems generate answers from gold-standard documents, or under synthetically perturbed settings, where documents are artificially injected with noise. These assumptions fail to reflect real-world conditions, often leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To address this gap, we introduce RAGuard, the first benchmark to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our fact-checking dataset captures naturally occurring misinformation by constructing its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and unrelated, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different types of evidence. Our experiments reveal that, when exposed to potentially misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), while human annotators consistently perform better, highlighting LLMs' susceptibility to noisy environments. To our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess the robustness of the RAG against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark to drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-IRKM/RAGuard.</description>

      <title>LeanProgress: Guiding Search for Neural Theorem Proving via Proof Progress Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to hallucinations. When combined with formal proof assistants like Lean, these hallucinations can be eliminated through rigorous verification, making theorem proving reliable. However, even with formal verification, LLMs still struggle with long proofs and complex mathematical formalizations. While Lean with LLMs offers valuable assistance with retrieving lemmas, generating tactics, or even complete proofs, it lacks a crucial capability: providing a sense of proof progress. This limitation particularly impacts the overall development efficiency in large formalization projects. We introduce LeanProgress, a method that predicts the progress in the proof. Training and evaluating our models made on a large corpus of Lean proofs from Lean Workbook Plus and Mathlib4 and how many steps remain to complete it, we employ data preprocessing and balancing techniques to handle the skewed distribution of proof lengths. Our experiments show that LeanProgress achieves an overall prediction accuracy of 75.8% in predicting the amount of progress and, hence, the remaining number of steps. When integrated into a best-first search framework using Reprover, our method shows a 3.8% improvement on Mathlib4 compared to baseline performances of 41.4%, particularly for longer proofs. These results demonstrate how proof progress prediction can enhance both automated and interactive theorem proving, enabling users to make more informed decisions about proof strategies. Our code is merged in this library here https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanDojo-v2.</description>

      <title>EconEvals: Benchmarks and Litmus Tests for Economic Decision-Making by LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop evaluation methods for measuring the economic decision-making capabilities and tendencies of LLMs. First, we develop benchmarks derived from key problems in economics -- procurement, scheduling, and pricing -- that test an LLM's ability to learn from the environment in context. Second, we develop the framework of litmus tests, evaluations that quantify an LLM's choice behavior on a stylized decision-making task with multiple conflicting objectives. Each litmus test outputs a litmus score, which quantifies an LLM's tradeoff response, a reliability score, which measures the coherence of an LLM's choice behavior, and a competency score, which measures an LLM's capability at the same task when the conflicting objectives are replaced by a single, well-specified objective. Evaluating a broad array of frontier LLMs, we (1) investigate changes in LLM capabilities and tendencies over time, (2) derive economically meaningful insights from the LLMs' choice behavior and chain-of-thought, (3) validate our litmus test framework by testing self-consistency, robustness, and generalizability. Overall, this work provides a foundation for evaluating LLM agents as they are further integrated into economic decision-making.</description>

      <title>KeyDiff: Key Similarity-Based KV Cache Eviction for Long-Context LLM Inference in Resource-Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15364v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that geometrically distinctive keys during LLM inference tend to have high attention scores. Based on the phenomenon we propose KeyDiff, a training-free KV cache eviction method based solely on key similarity. Unlike other KV cache eviction methods, KeyDiff can process arbitrarily long prompts within strict resource constraints and efficiently generate responses. We provide a theoretical basis for KeyDiff by relating key diversity with attention scores. These results imply KeyDiff can efficiently identify the most important tokens to retain. Notably KeyDiff does not rely on attention scores, allowing the use of optimized attention mechanisms like FlashAttention. Under a strict memory allowance, we demonstrate the effectiveness of KeyDiff for the Llama and Qwen model families by observing a performance gap of less than 0.04% with 8K cache budget ($\sim$23% KV cache reduction) from the non-evicting baseline on LongBench for Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.2-3B. We also observe near baseline performance for Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on the Math500 reasoning benchmark and decrease end-to-end inference latency by up to 30% compared to the other token-eviction methods.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking AI scientists for omics data driven biological discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled the emergence of AI scientists that aim to autonomously analyze biological data and assist scientific discovery. Despite rapid progress, it remains unclear to what extent these systems can extract meaningful biological insights from real experimental data. Existing benchmarks either evaluate reasoning in the absence of data or focus on predefined analytical outputs, failing to reflect realistic, data-driven biological research. Here, we introduce BAISBench (Biological AI Scientist Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating AI scientists on real single-cell transcriptomic datasets. BAISBench comprises two tasks: cell type annotation across 15 expert-labeled datasets, and scientific discovery through 193 multiple-choice questions derived from biological conclusions reported in 41 published single-cell studies. We evaluated several representative AI scientists using BAISBench and, to provide a human performance baseline, invited six graduate-level bioinformaticians to collectively complete the same tasks. The results show that while current AI scientists fall short of fully autonomous biological discovery, they already demonstrate substantial potential in supporting data-driven biological research. These results position BAISBench as a practical benchmark for characterizing the current capabilities and limitations of AI scientists in biological research. We expect BAISBench to serve as a practical evaluation framework for guiding the development of more capable AI scientists and for helping biologists identify AI systems that can effectively support real-world research workflows. The BAISBench can be found at: https://github.com/EperLuo/BAISBench, https://huggingface.co/datasets/EperLuo/BaisBench.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Infer Causal Relationships from Real-World Text?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and inferring causal relationships from texts is a core aspect of human cognition and is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs) towards artificial general intelligence. Existing work evaluating LLM causal reasoning primarily relies on synthetic or simplified texts with explicitly stated causal relationships. These texts typically feature short passages and few causal relations, failing to reflect the complexities of real-world reasoning. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs are capable of inferring causal relationships from real-world texts. We develop a benchmark drawn from real-world academic literature, which includes diverse texts with respect to length, complexity (different levels of explicitness, number of causal events and relationships), and domain. To the best of our knowledge, our benchmark is the first-ever real-world dataset for this task. Our experiments on this dataset show that LLMs face significant challenges in inferring causal relationships from real-world text, with the best-performing model achieving an average F$_1$ score of only 0.535. Through systematic analysis across aspects of real-world text (explicitness, number of causal events and relationships, length of text, domain), our benchmark offers targeted insights for further research into advancing LLM causal reasoning.

      <title>Hypothesis Generation via LLM-Automated Language Bias for ILP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a principled approach for generalizing regularities from data and constructing hypotheses as interpretable logic programs. However, a key limitation is its reliance on expert-crafted language bias - the predicate inventory, types, and mode declarations that delimit the search space. We propose hypothesis generation via LLM-automated language bias: multi-agent LLMs design the bias from raw text and translate descriptions into typed facts, and a robust ILP solver induces rules under a global consistency objective. This approach reduces traditional ILP's reliance on predefined symbolic structures and the noise sensitivity of LLM-only pipelines that directly generate hypotheses as text or code. Extensive experiments in diverse, challenging scenarios validate superior performance, providing a practical, explainable, and verifiable route to hypothesis generation.</description>

      <title>EVOREFUSE: Evolutionary Prompt Optimization for Evaluation and Mitigation of LLM Over-Refusal to Pseudo-Malicious Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently refuse to respond to pseudo-malicious instructions: semantically harmless input queries triggering unnecessary LLM refusals due to conservative safety alignment, significantly impairing user experience. Collecting such instructions is crucial for evaluating and mitigating over-refusals, but existing instruction curation methods, like manual creation or instruction rewriting, either lack scalability or fail to produce sufficiently diverse and effective refusal-inducing prompts. To address these limitations, we introduce EVOREFUSE, a prompt optimization approach that generates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions consistently eliciting confident refusals across LLMs. EVOREFUSE employs an evolutionary algorithm exploring the instruction space in more diverse directions than existing methods via mutation strategies and recombination, and iteratively evolves seed instructions to maximize evidence lower bound on LLM refusal probability. Using EVOREFUSE, we create two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark of 582 pseudo-malicious instructions that outperforms the next-best benchmark with 85.34% higher average refusal triggering rate across 9 LLMs without a safety-prior system prompt, 34.86% greater lexical diversity, and 40.03% improved LLM response confidence scores; and EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which provides 3,000 pseudo-malicious instructions with responses for supervised and preference-based alignment training. With supervised fine-tuning on EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT achieves up to 29.85% fewer over-refusals than models trained on the second-best alignment dataset, without compromising safety. Our analysis with EVOREFUSE-TEST reveals models trigger over-refusals by overly focusing on sensitive keywords while ignoring broader context. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/FishT0ucher/EVOREFUSE.</description>

      <title>Representing Time-Continuous Behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-continuous dynamic models are essential for various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications. To ensure effective usability in different lifecycle phases, such behavioral information in the form of differential equations must be contextualized and integrated with further CPS information. While knowledge graphs provide a formal description and structuring mechanism for this task, there is a lack of reusable ontological artifacts and methods to reduce manual instantiation effort. Hence, this contribution introduces two artifacts: Firstly, a modular semantic model based on standards is introduced to represent differential equations directly within knowledge graphs and to enrich them semantically. Secondly, a method for efficient knowledge graph generation is presented. A validation of these artifacts was conducted in the domain of aviation maintenance. Results show that differential equations of a complex Electro-Hydraulic Servoactuator can be formally represented in a knowledge graph and be contextualized with other lifecycle data, proving the artifacts' practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Mxplainer: Explain and Learn Insights by Imitating Mahjong Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People need to internalize the skills of AI agents to improve their own capabilities. Our paper focuses on Mahjong, a multiplayer game involving imperfect information and requiring effective long-term decision-making amidst randomness and hidden information. Through the efforts of AI researchers, several impressive Mahjong AI agents have already achieved performance levels comparable to those of professional human players; however, these agents are often treated as black boxes from which few insights can be gleaned. This paper introduces Mxplainer, a parameterized search algorithm that can be converted into an equivalent neural network to learn the parameters of black-box agents. Experiments on both human and AI agents demonstrate that Mxplainer achieves a top-three action prediction accuracy of over 92% and 90%, respectively, while providing faithful and interpretable approximations that outperform decision-tree methods (34.8% top-three accuracy). This enables Mxplainer to deliver both strategy-level insights into agent characteristics and actionable, step-by-step explanations for individual decisions.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Deception Probes via Black-to-White Performance Boosts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries. Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance boosts from existing deception probes.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Self-Evolving Agents: What, When, How, and Where to Evolve on the Path to Artificial Super Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21046v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks but remain fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks, evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organizing the field around three foundational dimensions: what, when, and how to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g., models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages (e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards, textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents, highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare, and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety, scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a roadmap for advancing more adaptive, robust, and versatile agentic systems in both research and real-world deployments, and ultimately sheds light on the realization of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) where agents evolve autonomously and perform beyond human-level intelligence across tasks.</description>

      <title>ReflecSched: Solving Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling via LLM-Powered Hierarchical Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NP-hard Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) problem involves real-time events and complex routing. While traditional rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning is opaque and requires feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed Strategic Experience. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments demonstrate ReflecSched achieves superior performance, with its best variants attaining an average RPD of 6.09% and rank of 4.39 on GEN-Bench, significantly outperforming strong traditional and learning-based methods including HMPSAC and IDDQN. It also statistically and decisively surpasses direct LLM baselines, securing a 71.35% Win Rate while being, on average, 15.1% more token-efficient on Normal-scale problems. Furthermore, cumulative runtime analysis reveals that ReflecSched's zero-shot nature eliminates the training bottleneck, providing a decisive efficiency advantage in high-variability manufacturing environments. Ablation studies attribute this performance to a robust reflection mechanism that leverages high-quality, contrastive experience. Ultimately, the framework's performance is statistically on par with an oracle-like strategy, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>V2P: Visual Attention Calibration for GUI Grounding via Background Suppression and Center Peaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform modeling the target UI element fails to distinguish between its center and edges, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size. Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.4\% and 52.5\% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's contribution, underscoring V2P's generalizability in precise GUI grounding tasks and its potential for real-world deployment in future GUI agents.</description>

      <title>FAIRGAMER: Evaluating Social Biases in LLM-Based Video Game NPCs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly enhanced or replaced traditional Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in video games. However, these LLM-based NPCs inherit underlying social biases (e.g., race or class), posing fairness risks during in-game interactions. To address the limited exploration of this issue, we introduce FairGamer, the first benchmark to evaluate social biases across three interaction patterns: transaction, cooperation, and competition. FairGamer assesses four bias types, including class, race, age, and nationality, across 12 distinct evaluation tasks using a novel metric, FairMCV. Our evaluation of seven frontier LLMs reveals that: (1) models exhibit biased decision-making, with Grok-4-Fast demonstrating the highest bias (average FairMCV = 76.9%); and (2) larger LLMs display more severe social biases, suggesting that increased model capacity inadvertently amplifies these biases. We release FairGamer at https://github.com/Anonymous999-xxx/FairGamer to facilitate future research on NPC fairness.</description>

      <title>Answering the Unanswerable Is to Err Knowingly: Analyzing and Mitigating Abstention Failures in Large Reasoning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze, investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall reasoning performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for domain-specific LLMs, yet it is often plagued by "Retrieval Hallucinations"--a phenomenon where fine-tuned models fail to recognize and act upon poor-quality retrieved documents, thus undermining performance. To address this, we propose the Adversarial Collaboration RAG (AC-RAG) framework. AC-RAG employs two heterogeneous agents: a generalist Detector that identifies knowledge gaps, and a domain-specialized Resolver that provides precise solutions. Guided by a moderator, these agents engage in an adversarial collaboration, where the Detector's persistent questioning challenges the Resolver's expertise. This dynamic process allows for iterative problem dissection and refined knowledge retrieval. Extensive experiments show that AC-RAG significantly improves retrieval accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods across various vertical domains.</description>

Abstract: Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved communities. These include therapy chatbots, crisis detection, and wellness platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances, general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges, including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an approach to apply Constitutional AI training with domain-specific mental health principles for safe, domain-adapted CAI systems in computational mental health applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluation-Aware Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme -- in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation, conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a strong recent emphasis on trustworthy AI. In particular, international regulations, such as the AI Act, demand that AI practitioners measure data quality on the input and estimate bias on the output of high-risk AI systems. However, there are many challenges involved, including scalability (MMD) and computability (Wasserstein-1) issues of traditional methods for estimating distances on measure spaces. Here, we present humancompatible.detect, a toolkit for bias detection that addresses these challenges. It incorporates two newly developed methods to detect and evaluate bias: maximum subgroup discrepancy (MSD) and subsampled $\ell_\infty$ distances. It has an easy-to-use API documented with multiple examples. humancompatible.detect is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.</description>

      <title>Visual serial processing deficits explain divergences in human and VLM reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks, often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation. Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts, enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis, indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.</description>

      <title>Message passing-based inference in an autoregressive active inference agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions. Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's dynamics.</description>

      <title>When Hallucination Costs Millions: Benchmarking AI Agents in High-Stakes Adversarial Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation: the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible. While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings, real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle. Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically, we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries, e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.</description>

      <title>PRISM-Consult: A Panel-of-Experts Architecture for Clinician-Aligned Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal, Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. This initial study evaluates a scoped panel of five specialist families defined by high-impact ED diagnostic groups. On real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs.\ conclusive ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment standards.</description>

      <title>Think Then Embed: Generative Context Improves Multimodal Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>Structuring Reasoning for Complex Rules Beyond Flat Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes. DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages: qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements ([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules. Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.</description>

      <title>AgentAsk: Multi-Agent Systems Need to Ask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models promise improved problem-solving through collaboration, yet they often fail to consistently outperform strong single-agent baselines due to error propagation at inter-agent message handoffs.In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of such failures and introduce an edge-level error taxonomy that identifies four dominant error types: Data Gap, Signal Corruption, Referential Drift, and Capability Gap, as primary sources of failure in multi-agent interactions. Building on this taxonomy, we propose AgentAsk, a lightweight clarification module designed to intervene at the edge level in MAS to prevent cascading errors. The module operates by strategically applying minimal clarifications at critical points within the system, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the overall task. AgentAsk is trained to balance the trade-offs between clarification cost, latency, and accuracy, while it is also architecture-agnostic and can be easily integrated into existing systems. Evaluated across five benchmarks, AgentAsk consistently improves accuracy by up to 4.69%, while keeping latency and extra costs below 10% compared to baseline MAS, showcasing its high efficiency and minimal overhead.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks, as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models the task as a constraint problem and leverages formal complexity measures to guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SAT-Bench) and LLM database querying tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of complexity, agent can perform considerably better.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and, crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly within complex urban environments.</description>

      <title>ReviewSense: Transforming Customer Review Dynamics into Actionable Business Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential. While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive, business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives, highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis, demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the impact of customer feedback.</description>

      <title>Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL), which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters. Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall performance and 8.02% in forward transfer.

      <title>ETOM: A Five-Level Benchmark for Evaluating Tool Orchestration within the MCP Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ETOM, a five-level benchmark for evaluating multi-hop, end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents within a hierarchical Model-Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often assess tools in isolation, overlooking challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server orchestration, which can lead to overly optimistic evaluations. ETOM addresses these gaps by constructing ground truth through "equal function sets", enabling objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing reliance on LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Its five-level curriculum systematically tests agent capabilities, from single-tool orchestration to complex cross-server planning, as well as robustness to out-of-scope requests. Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic weaknesses in robustness. ETOM provides a diagnostic framework to expose these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient tool-using agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23045v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound transition from a computational instrument to an autonomous originator of scientific knowledge. This emerging paradigm, the AI scientist, is architected to emulate the complete scientific workflow-from initial hypothesis generation to the final synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape, obscuring overarching methodological principles and developmental trends. This survey provides a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of this domain by introducing a unified, six-stage methodological framework that deconstructs the end-to-end scientific process into: Literature Review, Idea Generation, Experimental Preparation, Experimental Execution, Scientific Writing, and Paper Generation. Through this analytical lens, we chart the field's evolution from early Foundational Modules (2022-2023) to integrated Closed-Loop Systems (2024), and finally to the current frontier of Scalability, Impact, and Human-AI Collaboration (2025-present). By rigorously synthesizing these developments, this survey not only clarifies the current state of autonomous science but also provides a critical roadmap for overcoming remaining challenges in robustness and governance, ultimately guiding the next generation of systems toward becoming trustworthy and indispensable partners in human scientific inquiry.</description>

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e., soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.</description>

      <title>Inverse Knowledge Search over Verifiable Reasoning: Synthesizing a Scientific Encyclopedia from a Long Chains-of-Thought Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base, this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia.</description>

      <title>PADiff: Predictive and Adaptive Diffusion Policies for Ad Hoc Teamwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to collaborate with previously unseen teammates, which is crucial for many real-world applications. The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.</description>

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI aims to combine the strengths of neural architectures and symbolic reasoning to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capability of AI models. While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible.</description>

      <title>Forgetting-MarI: LLM Unlearning via Marginal Information Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI models are trained on ever-expanding datasets, the ability to remove the influence of specific data from trained models has become essential for privacy protection and regulatory compliance. Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Towards Reinforcement Learning from Neural Feedback: Mapping fNIRS Signals to Agent Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a methodology that aligns agent behavior with human preferences by integrating user feedback into the agent's training process. This paper introduces a framework that guides agent training through implicit neural signals, with a focus on the neural classification problem. Our work presents and releases a novel dataset of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings collected from 25 human participants across three domains: Pick-and-Place Robot, Lunar Lander, and Flappy Bird. We train multiple classifiers to predict varying levels of agent performance (optimal, suboptimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS features, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary and 46% for multi-class classification across conditions and domains. We also train multiple regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policy actions, providing a continuous measure of performance. Finally, we evaluate cross-subject generalization and show that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively. Our results demonstrate that mapping implicit fNIRS signals to agent performance is feasible and can be improved, laying the foundation for future Reinforcement Learning from Neural Feedback (RLNF) systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We seek to clarify the concept of active inference by disentangling it from the Free Energy Principle. We show how the optimizations that need to be carried out in order to implement active inference in discrete state spaces can be formulated as constrained divergence minimization problems which can be solved by standard mean field methods that do not appeal to the idea of expected free energy. When it is used to model perception, the perception/action divergence criterion that we propose coincides with variational free energy. When it is used to model action, it differs from an expected free energy functional by an entropy regularizer.</description>

      <title>Academic journals' AI policies fail to curb the surge in AI-assisted academic writing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid integration of generative AI into academic writing has prompted widespread policy responses from journals and publishers. However, the effectiveness of these policies remains unclear. Here, we analyze 5,114 journals and over 5.2 million papers to evaluate the real-world impact of AI usage guidelines. We show that despite 70% of journals adopting AI policies (primarily requiring disclosure), researchers' use of AI writing tools has increased dramatically across disciplines, with no significant difference between journals with or without policies. Non-English-speaking countries, physical sciences, and high-OA journals exhibit the highest growth rates. Crucially, full-text analysis on 164k scientific publications reveals a striking transparency gap: Of the 75k papers published since 2023, only 76 (~0.1%) explicitly disclosed AI use. Our findings suggest that current policies have largely failed to promote transparency or restrain AI adoption. We urge a re-evaluation of ethical frameworks to foster responsible AI integration in science.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fast and Slow: Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks. However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents our work on cross-lingual ontology alignment system which uses embedding based cosine similarity matching. The ontology entities are made contextually richer by creating descriptions using novel techniques. We use a fine-tuned transformer based multilingual model for generating better embeddings. We use cosine similarity to find positive ontology entities pairs and then apply threshold filtering to retain only highly similar entities. We have evaluated our work on OAEI-2022 multifarm track. We achieve 71% F1 score (78% recall and 65% precision) on the evaluation dataset, 16% increase from best baseline score. This suggests that our proposed alignment pipeline is able to capture the subtle cross-lingual similarities.</description>

      <title>Logics-STEM: Empowering LLM Reasoning via Failure-Driven Post-Training and Document Knowledge Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Logics-STEM, a state-of-the-art reasoning model fine-tuned on Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset, a high-quality and diverse dataset at 10M scale that represents one of the largest-scale open-source long chain-of-thought corpora. Logics-STEM targets reasoning tasks in the domains of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and exhibits exceptional performance on STEM-related benchmarks with an average improvement of 4.68% over the next-best model at 8B scale. We attribute the gains to our data-algorithm co-design engine, where they are jointly optimized to fit a gold-standard distribution behind reasoning. Data-wise, the Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset is constructed from a meticulously designed data curation engine with 5 stages to ensure the quality, diversity, and scalability, including annotation, deduplication, decontamination, distillation, and stratified sampling. Algorithm-wise, our failure-driven post-training framework leverages targeted knowledge retrieval and data synthesis around model failure regions in the Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) stage to effectively guide the second-stage SFT or the reinforcement learning (RL) for better fitting the target distribution. The superior empirical performance of Logics-STEM reveals the vast potential of combining large-scale open-source data with carefully designed synthetic data, underscoring the critical role of data-algorithm co-design in enhancing reasoning capabilities through post-training. We make both the Logics-STEM models (8B and 32B) and the Logics-STEM-SFT-Dataset (10M and downsampled 2.2M versions) publicly available to support future research in the open-source community.</description>

      <title>Learning Latent Action World Models In The Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agents capable of reasoning and planning in the real world require the ability of predicting the consequences of their actions. While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world.</description>

      <title>Safety Not Found (404): Hidden Risks of LLM-Based Robotics Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating Language Models (LMs) in specialized, high-stakes domains such as finance remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of open, high-quality, and domain-specific datasets. Existing general-purpose benchmarks provide broad coverage but lack the depth and domain fidelity needed to assess LMs' capabilities for real-world financial reasoning, which requires both conceptual understanding and quantitative rigor. To address this gap, we introduce FinForge, a scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline for constructing finance-specific evaluation benchmarks through a hybrid of expert-guided data curation and controlled LM-based synthesis. FinForge combines manual and programmatic corpus construction from authoritative financial sources with structured question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash. To demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy, we produce FinForge-5k, a snapshot benchmark comprising over 5,000 human-validated question-answer pairs across 11 finance subdomains, derived from a curated corpus of 100,000 verified documents totaling 143M tokens. Evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models on FinForge-5k reveals significant differences in financial reasoning, with leading models achieving accuracy levels near 80%. These findings underscore the framework's utility for diagnosing current model limitations and guiding future improvements in financial domain competence.

      <title>ET-Agent: Incentivizing Effective Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent via Behavior Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can extend their parameter knowledge limits by adopting the Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) paradigm. However, existing LLM-based agent training framework often focuses on answers' accuracy, overlooking specific alignment for behavior patterns. Consequently, agent often exhibits ineffective actions during TIR tasks, such as redundant and insufficient tool calls. How to calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns when executing TIR tasks, thereby exploring effective trajectories, remains an open-ended problem. In this paper, we propose ET-Agent, a training framework for calibrating agent's tool-use behavior through two synergistic perspectives: Self-evolving Data Flywheel and Behavior Calibration Training. Specifically, we introduce a self-evolutionary data flywheel to generate enhanced data, used to fine-tune LLM to improve its exploration ability. Based on this, we implement an two-phases behavior-calibration training framework. It is designed to progressively calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns to optimal behaviors. Further in-depth experiments confirm the superiority of \ourmodel{} across multiple dimensions, including correctness, efficiency, reasoning conciseness, and tool execution accuracy. Our ET-Agent framework provides practical insights for research in the TIR field. Codes can be found in https://github.com/asilverlight/ET-Agent</description>

      <title>Improving LLM Reasoning with Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Text-Attributed Graph Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in Text-Attributed Graph (TAG) understanding. Recent studies typically focus on verbalizing the graph structures via handcrafted prompts, feeding the target node and its neighborhood context into LLMs. However, constrained by the context window, existing methods mainly resort to random sampling, often implemented via dropping node/edge randomly, which inevitably introduces noise and cause reasoning instability. We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that, by feeding LLMs with structurally and semantically compressed inputs, HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability. Extensions to 7 diverse graph-level benchmarks further consolidate HS2C's task generalizability.</description>

      <title>Learner-Tailored Program Repair: A Solution Generator with Iterative Edit-Driven Retrieval Enhancement</title>

Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs) in the field of programming, intelligent programming coaching systems have gained widespread attention. However, most research focuses on repairing the buggy code of programming learners without providing the underlying causes of the bugs. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task, namely LRP (Learner-Tailored Program Repair). We then propose a novel and effective framework, LSGEN (Learner-Tailored Solution Generator), to enhance program repair while offering the bug descriptions for the buggy code. In the first stage, we utilize a repair solution retrieval framework to construct a solution retrieval database and then employ an edit-driven code retrieval approach to retrieve valuable solutions, guiding LLMs in identifying and fixing the bugs in buggy code. In the second stage, we propose a solution-guided program repair method, which fixes the code and provides explanations under the guidance of retrieval solutions. Moreover, we propose an Iterative Retrieval Enhancement method that utilizes evaluation results of the generated code to iteratively optimize the retrieval direction and explore more suitable repair strategies, improving performance in practical programming coaching scenarios. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our framework for the newly proposed LPR task.</description>

      <title>Pervasive Annotation Errors Break Text-to-SQL Benchmarks and Leaderboards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers have proposed numerous text-to-SQL techniques to streamline data analytics and accelerate the development of data-driven applications. To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.
  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

      <title>RISER: Orchestrating Latent Reasoning Skills for Adaptive Activation Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work on domain-specific reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often relies on training-intensive approaches that require parameter updates. While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains. Further analysis shows that RISER autonomously combines multiple vectors into interpretable, precise control strategies, pointing toward more controllable and efficient LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>Matrix as Plan: Structured Logical Reasoning with Feedback-Driven Replanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs)' comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. The LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions and attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan thus becomes a verifiable artifact and execution becomes more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both the robustness and interpretability of LLMs when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.</description>

      <title>ChartComplete: A Taxonomy-based Inclusive Chart Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With advancements in deep learning (DL) and computer vision techniques, the field of chart understanding is evolving rapidly. In particular, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proving to be efficient and accurate in understanding charts. To accurately measure the performance of MLLMs, the research community has developed multiple datasets to serve as benchmarks. By examining these datasets, we found that they are all limited to a small set of chart types. To bridge this gap, we propose the ChartComplete dataset. The dataset is based on a chart taxonomy borrowed from the visualization community, and it covers thirty different chart types. The dataset is a collection of classified chart images and does not include a learning signal. We present the ChartComplete dataset as is to the community to build upon it.</description>

      <title>AgencyBench: Benchmarking the Frontiers of Autonomous Agents in 1M-Token Real-World Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based autonomous agents demonstrate multifaceted capabilities to contribute substantially to economic production. However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.</description>

      <title>MiCA: A Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter for Lightweight Epidemic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of infectious disease dynamics is critical for public health planning and intervention. Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.</description>

      <title>Eye-tracked Virtual Reality: A Comprehensive Survey on Methods and Privacy Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest developments in computer hardware, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence can make virtual reality (VR) and virtual spaces an important part of human everyday life. Eye tracking offers not only a hands-free way of interaction but also the possibility of a deeper understanding of human visual attention and cognitive processes in VR. Despite these possibilities, eye-tracking data also reveals users' privacy-sensitive attributes when combined with the information about the presented stimulus. To address all, this survey first covers major works in eye tracking, VR, and privacy areas between 2012 and 2022. While eye tracking in VR part covers the computational eye tracking pipeline from pupil detection and gaze estimation to offline data analysis, for privacy and security, we focus on eye-based authentication as well as computational methods to preserve the privacy of individuals and their eye-tracking data in VR. Later, we outline three main directions by focusing on privacy. In summary, this survey presents an extensive literature review of the utmost possibilities of eye tracking in VR and their privacy implications.</description>

      <title>Shape Completion with Prediction of Uncertain Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape completion, i.e., predicting the complete geometry of an object from a partial observation, is highly relevant for several downstream tasks, most notably robotic manipulation. When basing planning or prediction of real grasps on object shape reconstruction, an indication of severe geometric uncertainty is indispensable. In particular, there can be an irreducible uncertainty in extended regions about the presence of entire object parts when given ambiguous object views. To treat this important case, we propose two novel methods for predicting such uncertain regions as straightforward extensions of any method for predicting local spatial occupancy, one through postprocessing occupancy scores, the other through direct prediction of an uncertainty indicator. We compare these methods together with two known approaches to probabilistic shape completion. Moreover, we generate a dataset, derived from ShapeNet, of realistically rendered depth images of object views with ground-truth annotations for the uncertain regions. We train on this dataset and test each method in shape completion and prediction of uncertain regions for known and novel object instances and on synthetic and real data. While direct uncertainty prediction is by far the most accurate in the segmentation of uncertain regions, both novel methods outperform the two baselines in shape completion and uncertain region prediction, and avoiding the predicted uncertain regions increases the quality of grasps for all tested methods.</description>

      <title>Combining Shape Completion and Grasp Prediction for Fast and Versatile Grasping with a Multi-Fingered Hand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grasping objects with limited or no prior knowledge about them is a highly relevant skill in assistive robotics. Still, in this general setting, it has remained an open problem, especially when it comes to only partial observability and versatile grasping with multi-fingered hands. We present a novel, fast, and high fidelity deep learning pipeline consisting of a shape completion module that is based on a single depth image, and followed by a grasp predictor that is based on the predicted object shape. The shape completion network is based on VQDIF and predicts spatial occupancy values at arbitrary query points. As grasp predictor, we use our two-stage architecture that first generates hand poses using an autoregressive model and then regresses finger joint configurations per pose. Critical factors turn out to be sufficient data realism and augmentation, as well as special attention to difficult cases during training. Experiments on a physical robot platform demonstrate successful grasping of a wide range of household objects based on a depth image from a single viewpoint. The whole pipeline is fast, taking only about 1 s for completing the object's shape (0.7 s) and generating 1000 grasps (0.3 s).</description>

      <title>GNN2R: Weakly-Supervised Rationale-Providing Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02317v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), knowledge graph-based question answering (KGQA) remains essential for producing verifiable and hallucination-resistant answers in many real-world settings where answer trustworthiness and computational efficiency are highly valued. However, most existing KGQA methods provide only final answers in the form of KG entities. Without explicit explanations -- ideally in the form of intermediate reasoning process over relevant KG triples, the QA results are difficult to inspect and interpret. Moreover, this limitation prevents the rich and verifiable knowledge encoded in KGs, which is a key advantage of KGQA over LLMs, from being fully leveraged. However, addressing this issue remains highly challenging due to the lack of annotated intermediate reasoning process and the requirement of high efficiency in KGQA. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network-based Two-Step Reasoning method (GNN2R) that can efficiently retrieve both final answers and corresponding reasoning subgraphs as verifiable rationales, using only weak supervision from widely-available final answer annotations. We extensively evaluated GNN2R and demonstrated that GNN2R substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art KGQA methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and the quality of generated explanations. The complete code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ruijie-wang-uzh/GNN2R.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Quadratic Time-Frequency Analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks to Diagnose Bearing Faults Under Time-Varying Speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diagnosis of bearing faults is paramount to reducing maintenance costs and operational breakdowns. Bearing faults are primary contributors to machine vibrations, and analyzing their signal morphology offers insights into their health status. Unfortunately, existing approaches are optimized for controlled environments, neglecting realistic conditions such as time-varying rotational speeds and the vibration's non-stationary nature. This paper presents a fusion of time-frequency analysis and deep learning techniques to diagnose bearing faults under time-varying speeds and varying noise levels. First, we formulate the bearing fault-induced vibrations and discuss the link between their non-stationarity and the bearing's inherent and operational parameters. We also elucidate quadratic time-frequency distributions and validate their effectiveness in resolving distinctive dynamic patterns associated with different bearing faults. Based on this, we design a time-frequency convolutional neural network (TF-CNN) to diagnose various faults in rolling-element bearings. Our experimental findings undeniably demonstrate the superior performance of TF-CNN in comparison to recently developed techniques. They also assert its versatility in capturing fault-relevant non-stationary features that couple with speed changes and show its exceptional resilience to noise, consistently surpassing competing methods across various signal-to-noise ratios and performance metrics. Altogether, the TF-CNN achieves substantial accuracy improvements up to 15%, in severe noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Feature Visualizations with Gradient Slingshots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06122v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature Visualization (FV) is a widely used technique for interpreting concepts learned by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which synthesizes input patterns that maximally activate a given feature. Despite its popularity, the trustworthiness of FV explanations has received limited attention. We introduce Gradient Slingshots, a novel method that enables FV manipulation without modifying model architecture or significantly degrading performance. By shaping new trajectories in off-distribution regions of a feature's activation landscape, we coerce the optimization process to converge to a predefined visualization. We evaluate our approach on several DNN architectures, demonstrating its ability to replace faithful FVs with arbitrary targets. These results expose a critical vulnerability: auditors relying solely on FV may accept entirely fabricated explanations. To mitigate this risk, we propose a straightforward defense and quantitatively demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>DiffusionAgent: Navigating Expert Models for Agentic Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the accelerating era of human-instructed visual content creation, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative potential. Yet their deployment is constrained by a dual bottleneck: semantic ambiguity in diverse prompts and the narrow specialization of individual models. A single diffusion architecture struggles to maintain optimal performance across heterogeneous prompts, while conventional "parse-then-call" pipelines artificially separate semantic understanding from generative execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiffusionAgent, a unified, language-model-driven agent that casts the entire "prompt comprehension-expert routing-image synthesis" loop into a agentic framework. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) a tree-of-thought-powered expert navigator that performs fine-grained semantic parsing and zero-shot matching to the most suitable diffusion model via an extensible prior-knowledge tree; (2) an advantage database updated with human-in-the-loop feedback, continually aligning model-selection policy with human aesthetic and semantic preferences; and (3) a fully decoupled agent architecture that activates the optimal generative path for open-domain prompts without retraining or fine-tuning any expert. Extensive experiments show that DiffusionAgent retains high generation quality while significantly broadening prompt coverage, establishing a new performance and generality benchmark for multi-domain image synthesis.

      <title>Predictive Handover Strategy in 6G and Beyond: A Deep and Transfer Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation cellular networks will evolve into more complex and virtualized systems, employing machine learning for enhanced optimization and leveraging higher frequency bands and denser deployments to meet varied service demands. This evolution, while bringing numerous advantages, will also pose challenges, especially in mobility management, as it will increase the overall number of handovers due to smaller coverage areas and the higher signal attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning based algorithm for predicting the future serving cell utilizing sequential user equipment measurements to minimize the handover failures and interruption time. Our algorithm enables network operators to dynamically adjust handover triggering events or incorporate UAV base stations for enhanced coverage and capacity, optimizing network objectives like load balancing and energy efficiency through transfer learning techniques. Our framework complies with the O-RAN specifications and can be deployed in a Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller as an xApp leveraging the E2SM-KPM service model. The evaluation results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a 92% accuracy in predicting future serving cells with high probability. Finally, by utilizing transfer learning, our algorithm significantly reduces the retraining time by 91% and 77% when new handover trigger decisions or UAV base stations are introduced to the network dynamically.</description>

      <title>Few for Many: Tchebycheff Set Scalarization for Many-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization can be found in many real-world applications where some conflicting objectives can not be optimized by a single solution. Existing optimization methods often focus on finding a set of Pareto solutions with different optimal trade-offs among the objectives. However, the required number of solutions to well approximate the whole Pareto optimal set could be exponentially large with respect to the number of objectives, which makes these methods unsuitable for handling many optimization objectives. In this work, instead of finding a dense set of Pareto solutions, we propose a novel Tchebycheff set scalarization method to find a few representative solutions (e.g., 5) to cover a large number of objectives (e.g., $&gt;100$) in a collaborative and complementary manner. In this way, each objective can be well addressed by at least one solution in the small solution set. In addition, we further develop a smooth Tchebycheff set scalarization approach for efficient optimization with good theoretical guarantees. Experimental studies on different problems with many optimization objectives demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Rethinking and Red-Teaming Protective Perturbation in Personalized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18944v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized diffusion models (PDMs) have become prominent for adapting pre-trained text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects using minimal training data. However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted datasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective perturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification methods attempt to red-team the protective perturbation to break the protection but often over-purify images, resulting in information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a latent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP embedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate noisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor generalization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic red-teaming framework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning. We first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images with their original semantic content in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of personalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a thorough evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its advantages over existing purification methods and its robustness against adaptive perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00449v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully tensorial theory of hypercomplex neural networks is given. It allows neural networks to use arithmetic based on arbitrary algebras. The key point is to observe that algebra multiplication can be represented as a rank three tensor and use this tensor in every algebraic operation. This approach is attractive for neural network libraries that support effective tensorial operations. It agrees with previous implementations for four-dimensional algebras. The proof of Universal Approximation Theorem for tensor formalism was given.</description>

      <title>Super Monotonic Alignment Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monotonic alignment search (MAS), introduced by Glow-TTS, is one of the most popular algorithm in text-to-speech to estimate unknown alignments between text and speech. Since this algorithm needs to search for the most probable alignment with dynamic programming by caching all possible paths, the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(T \times S)$, where $T$ is the length of text and $S$ is the length of speech representation. The authors of Glow-TTS run this algorithm on CPU, and while they mentioned it is difficult to parallelize, we found that MAS can be parallelized in text length dimension and CPU execution consumes an inordinate amount of time for inter-device copy. Therefore, we implemented a Triton kernel and PyTorch JIT script to accelerate MAS on GPU without inter-device copy. As a result, Super-MAS Triton kernel is up to 72 times faster in the extreme-length case. The code is available at https://github.com/supertone-inc/super-monotonic-align.</description>

      <title>Unveiling and Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Recommendations: A Path to Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10825v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems excel in delivering comprehensive suggestions by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, they often inherit biases from skewed training data, favoring mainstream content while underrepresenting diverse or non-traditional options. This study explores the interplay between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, focusing on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. This paper analyzes bias in LLM-based recommendation systems across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, and Gemini), revealing its deep and pervasive impact on outcomes. Intersecting identities and contextual factors, like socioeconomic status, further amplify biases, complicating fair recommendations across diverse groups. Our findings reveal that bias in these systems is deeply ingrained, yet even simple interventions like prompt engineering can significantly reduce it. We further propose a retrieval-augmented generation strategy to mitigate bias more effectively. Numerical experiments validate these strategies, demonstrating both the pervasive nature of bias and the impact of the proposed solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00475v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic approach to analyzing copyright infringement disputes. Evidentiary principles shaped by case law are formalized in probabilistic terms, and the ``inverse ratio rule'' -- a controversial legal doctrine adopted by some courts -- is examined. Although this rule has faced significant criticism, a formal proof demonstrates its validity, provided it is properly defined. The probabilistic approach is further employed to study the copyright safety of generative AI. Specifically, the Near Access-Free (NAF) condition, previously proposed as a strategy for mitigating the heightened copyright infringement risks of generative AI, is evaluated. The analysis reveals limitations in its justifiability and efficacy.</description>

      <title>Undesirable Memorization in Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent research increasingly showcases the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is equally crucial to examine their associated risks. Among these, privacy and security vulnerabilities are particularly concerning, posing significant ethical and legal challenges. At the heart of these vulnerabilities stands memorization, which refers to a model's tendency to store and reproduce phrases from its training data. This phenomenon has been shown to be a fundamental source to various privacy and security attacks against LLMs. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of the literature on LLM memorization, exploring it across three dimensions: granularity, retrievability, and desirability. Next, we discuss the metrics and methods used to quantify memorization, followed by an analysis of the causes and factors that contribute to memorization phenomenon. We then explore strategies that are used so far to mitigate the undesirable aspects of this phenomenon. We conclude our survey by identifying potential research topics for the near future, including methods to balance privacy and performance, and the analysis of memorization in specific LLM contexts such as conversational agents, retrieval-augmented generation, and diffusion language models. Given the rapid research pace in this field, we also maintain a dedicated repository of the references discussed in this survey which will be regularly updated to reflect the latest developments.</description>

      <title>TabDPT: Scaling Tabular Foundation Models on Real Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tabular data is one of the most ubiquitous sources of information worldwide, spanning a wide variety of domains. This inherent heterogeneity has slowed the development of Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) capable of fast generalization to unseen datasets. In-Context Learning (ICL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for TFMs, enabling dynamic adaptation to new tasks without additional tuning. While many studies have attempted to re-purpose large language models for tabular ICL, they have had limited success, so recent works have focused on developing tabular-specific foundation models. In this work, we propose an approach to combine ICL-based retrieval with self supervised learning to train tabular foundation models. We also investigate the utility of real vs. synthetic data for model pre-training, and show that real data can contain useful signal not easily captured in synthetic training. Specifically, we show that incorporating real data during the pre-training phase can lead to significantly faster training and better downstream generalization to unseen data. Our resulting model, TabDPT, achieves strong performance on both regression (CTR23) and classification (CC18) benchmarks. Importantly, we also demonstrate that with our pre-training procedure, scaling both model and data size leads to consistent performance improvements that follow power laws. This echoes scaling laws in LLMs and other foundation models, and suggests that large-scale TFMs can be achievable. We open-source our full pipeline: inference code including trained model weights can be found at github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-inference, and the training code to reproduce experiments can be found at github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-training.</description>

      <title>CausAdv: A Causal-based Framework for Detecting Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has led to tremendous success in computer vision, largely due to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to crafted adversarial perturbations. This vulnerability of adversarial examples has has motivated research into improving model robustness through adversarial detection and defense methods. In this paper, we address the adversarial robustness of CNNs through causal reasoning. We propose CausAdv: a causal framework for detecting adversarial examples based on counterfactual reasoning. CausAdv learns both causal and non-causal features of every input, and quantifies the counterfactual information (CI) of every filter of the last convolutional layer. We then perform a statistical analysis of the filters' CI across clean and adversarial samples, to demonstrate that adversarial examples exhibit different CI distributions compared to clean samples. Our results show that causal reasoning enhances the process of adversarial detection without the need to train a separate detector. Moreover, we illustrate the efficiency of causal explanations as a helpful detection tool by visualizing the extracted causal features.</description>

      <title>Modular Deep Learning for Multivariate Time-Series: Decoupling Imputation and Downstream Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Missing values are pervasive in large-scale time-series data, posing challenges for reliable analysis and decision-making. Many neural architectures have been designed to model and impute the complex and heterogeneous missingness patterns of such data. Most existing methods are end-to-end, rendering imputation tightly coupled with downstream predictive tasks and leading to limited reusability of the trained model, reduced interpretability, and challenges in assessing model quality. In this paper, we call for a modular approach that decouples imputation and downstream tasks, enabling independent optimisation and greater adaptability. Using the largest open-source Python library for deep learning-based time-series analysis, PyPOTS, we evaluate a modular pipeline across six state-of-the-art models that perform imputation and prediction on seven datasets spanning multiple domains. Our results show that a modular approach maintains high performance while prioritising flexibility and reusability - qualities that are crucial for real-world applications. Through this work, we aim to demonstrate how modularity can benefit multivariate time-series analysis, achieving a balance between performance and adaptability.</description>

Abstract: Understanding user intentions is challenging for online platforms. Recent work on intention knowledge graphs addresses this but often lacks focus on connecting intentions, which is crucial for modeling user behavior and predicting future actions. This paper introduces a framework to automatically generate an intention knowledge graph, capturing connections between user intentions. Using the Amazon m2 dataset, we construct an intention graph with 351 million edges, demonstrating high plausibility and acceptance. Our model effectively predicts new session intentions and enhances product recommendations, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods and showcasing the approach's practical utility.</description>

      <title>Towards a constructive framework for control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization, approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories, measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of digital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.</description>

      <title>HKAN: Hierarchical Kolmogorov-Arnold Network without Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Hierarchical Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (HKAN), a novel network architecture that offers a competitive alternative to the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Unlike KAN, which relies on backpropagation, HKAN adopts a randomized learning approach, where the parameters of its basis functions are fixed, and linear aggregations are optimized using least-squares regression. HKAN utilizes a hierarchical multi-stacking framework, with each layer refining the predictions from the previous one by solving a series of linear regression problems. This non-iterative training method simplifies computation and eliminates sensitivity to local minima in the loss function. Empirical results show that HKAN delivers comparable, if not superior, accuracy and stability relative to KAN across various regression tasks, while also providing insights into variable importance. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates theoretical insights with practical applications, presenting a robust and efficient alternative for neural network modeling.</description>

      <title>Jingfang: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Precise Medical Consultation and Syndrome Differentiation in Traditional Chinese Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) requires profound expertise and extensive clinical experience. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential in this domain, current TCM-oriented LLMs suffer two critical limitations: (1) a rigid consultation framework that fails to conduct comprehensive and patient-tailored interactions, often resulting in diagnostic inaccuracies; and (2) treatment recommendations generated without rigorous syndrome differentiation, which deviates from the core diagnostic and therapeutic principles of TCM. To address these issues, we develop \textbf{JingFang (JF)}, an advanced LLM-based multi-agent system for TCM that facilitates the implementation of AI-assisted TCM diagnosis and treatment. JF integrates various TCM Specialist Agents in accordance with authentic diagnostic and therapeutic scenarios of TCM, enabling personalized medical consultations, accurate syndrome differentiation and treatment recommendations. A \textbf{Multi-Agent Collaborative Consultation Mechanism (MACCM)} for TCM is constructed, where multiple Agents collaborate to emulate real-world TCM diagnostic workflows, enhancing the diagnostic ability of base LLMs to provide accurate and patient-tailored medical consultation. Moreover, we introduce a dedicated \textbf{Syndrome Differentiation Agent} fine-tuned on a preprocessed dataset, along with a designed \textbf{Dual-Stage Recovery Scheme (DSRS)} within the Treatment Agent, which together substantially improve the model's accuracy of syndrome differentiation and treatment. Comprehensive evaluations and experiments demonstrate JF's superior performance in medical consultation, and also show improvements of at least 124% and 21.1% in the precision of syndrome differentiation compared to existing TCM models and State of the Art (SOTA) LLMs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Gradient Learning with Hessian Corrections for High-Dimensional Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-box algorithms are designed to optimize functions without relying on their underlying analytical structure or gradient information, making them essential when gradients are inaccessible or difficult to compute. Traditional methods for solving black-box optimization (BBO) problems predominantly rely on non-parametric models and struggle to scale to large input spaces. Conversely, parametric methods that model the function with neural estimators and obtain gradient signals via backpropagation may suffer from significant gradient errors. A recent alternative, Explicit Gradient Learning (EGL), which directly learns the gradient using a first-order Taylor approximation, has demonstrated superior performance over both parametric and non-parametric methods. In this work, we propose two novel gradient learning variants to address the robustness challenges posed by high-dimensional, complex, and highly non-linear problems. Optimistic Gradient Learning (OGL) introduces a bias toward lower regions in the function landscape, while Higher-order Gradient Learning (HGL) incorporates second-order Taylor corrections to improve gradient accuracy. We combine these approaches into the unified OHGL algorithm, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the synthetic COCO suite. Additionally, we demonstrate OHGLs applicability to high-dimensional real-world machine learning (ML) tasks such as adversarial training and code generation. Our results highlight OHGLs ability to generate stronger candidates, offering a valuable tool for ML researchers and practitioners tackling high-dimensional, non-linear optimization challenges</description>

      <title>Who is Helping Whom? Analyzing Inter-dependencies to Evaluate Cooperation in Human-AI Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for Human-AI Teaming and Zero-shot Cooperation focus on task completion, i.e., task rewards, as the sole evaluation metric while being agnostic to how the two agents work with each other. Furthermore, subjective user studies only offer limited insight into the quality of cooperation existing within the team. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the cooperative behaviors arising within the team when trained agents are paired with humans -- a problem that has been overlooked by the existing literature. To formally address this problem, we propose the concept of constructive interdependence -- measuring how much agents rely on each other's actions to achieve the shared goal -- as a key metric for evaluating cooperation in human-agent teams. We interpret interdependence in terms of action interactions in a STRIPS formalism, and define metrics that allow us to assess the degree of reliance between the agents' actions. We pair state-of-the-art agents HAT with learned human models as well as human participants in a user study for the popular Overcooked domain, and evaluate the task reward and teaming performance for these human-agent teams. Our results demonstrate that although trained agents attain high task rewards, they fail to induce cooperative behavior, showing very low levels of interdependence across teams. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that teaming performance is not necessarily correlated with task reward, highlighting that task reward alone cannot reliably measure cooperation arising in a team.</description>

      <title>FBFL: A Field-Based Coordination Approach for Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08577v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last years, Federated learning (FL) has become a popular solution to train machine learning models in domains with high privacy concerns. However, FL scalability and performance face significant challenges in real-world deployments where data across devices are non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID). The heterogeneity in data distribution frequently arises from spatial distribution of devices, leading to degraded model performance in the absence of proper handling. Additionally, FL typical reliance on centralized architectures introduces bottlenecks and single-point-of-failure risks, particularly problematic at scale or in dynamic environments. To close this gap, we propose Field-Based Federated Learning (FBFL), a novel approach leveraging macroprogramming and field coordination to address these limitations through: (i) distributed spatial-based leader election for personalization to mitigate non-IID data challenges; and (ii) construction of a self-organizing, hierarchical architecture using advanced macroprogramming patterns. Moreover, FBFL not only overcomes the aforementioned limitations, but also enables the development of more specialized models tailored to the specific data distribution in each subregion. This paper formalizes FBFL and evaluates it extensively using MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Extended MNIST datasets. We demonstrate that, when operating under IID data conditions, FBFL performs comparably to the widely-used FedAvg algorithm. Furthermore, in challenging non-IID scenarios, FBFL not only outperforms FedAvg but also surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, namely FedProx and Scaffold, which have been specifically designed to address non-IID data distributions. Additionally, we showcase the resilience of FBFL's self-organizing hierarchical architecture against server failures.</description>

      <title>Object-Centric Latent Action Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled internet video data for embodied AI is currently bottlenecked by the lack of action labels and the presence of action-correlated visual distractors. Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle the movement of the agent and distracting background dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</description>

      <title>What Scalable Second-Order Information Knows for Pruning at Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pruning remains an effective strategy for reducing both the costs and environmental impact associated with deploying large neural networks (NNs) while maintaining performance. Classical methods, such as OBD (LeCun et al., 1989) and OBS (Hassibi et al., 1992), demonstrate that utilizing curvature information can significantly enhance the balance between network complexity and performance. However, the computation and storage of the Hessian matrix make it impractical for modern NNs, motivating the use of approximations. Recent research (Gur et al., 2018; Karakida et al., 2019) suggests that the top eigenvalues guide optimization in a small subspace, are identifiable early, and remain consistent during training. Motivated by these findings, we revisit pruning at initialization (PaI) to evaluate scalable, unbiased second-order approximations, such as the Empirical Fisher and Hutchinson diagonals. Our experiments show that these methods capture sufficient curvature information to improve the identification of critical parameters compared to first-order baselines, while maintaining linear complexity. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that updating batch normalization statistics as a warmup phase improves the performance of data-dependent criteria and mitigates the issue of layer collapse. Notably, Hutchinson-based criteria consistently outperformed or matched existing PaI algorithms across various models (including VGG, ResNet, and ViT) and datasets (such as CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet). Our findings suggest that scalable second-order approximations strike an effective balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, making them a valuable addition to the pruning toolkit. We make our code available.</description>

      <title>Generative Personality Simulation via Theory-Informed Structured Interview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their potential as human proxies, LLMs often fail to generate heterogeneous data with human-like diversity, thereby diminishing their value in advancing social science research. To address this gap, we propose a novel method to incorporate psychological insights into LLM simulation through the Personality Structured Interview (PSI). PSI leverages psychometric scale-development procedures to capture personality-related linguistic information from a formal psychological perspective. To systematically evaluate simulation fidelity, we developed a measurement theory grounded evaluation procedure that considers the latent construct nature of personality and evaluates its reliability, structural validity, and external validity. Results from three experiments demonstrate that PSI effectively improves human-like heterogeneity in LLM-simulated personality data and predicts personality-related behavioral outcomes. We further offer a theoretical framework for designing theory-informed structured interviews to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs in simulating human-like data for broader psychometric research.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Framing Effect in Humans and LLMs on Naturally Occurring Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans are influenced by how information is presented, a phenomenon known as the framing effect. Prior work suggests that LLMs may also be susceptible to framing, but it has relied on synthetic data and did not compare to human behavior. To address this gap, we introduce WildFrame - a dataset for evaluating LLM responses to positive and negative framing in naturally-occurring sentences, alongside human responses on the same data. WildFrame consists of 1,000 real-world texts selected to convey a clear sentiment; we then reframe each text in either a positive or negative light and collect human sentiment annotations. Evaluating eleven LLMs on WildFrame, we find that all models respond to reframing in a human-like manner ($r\geq0.52$), and that both humans and models are influenced more by positive than negative reframing. Notably, GPT models are the least correlated with human behavior among all tested models. These findings raise a discussion around the goals of state-of-the-art LLM development and whether models should align closely with human behavior, to preserve cognitive phenomena such as the framing effect, or instead mitigate such biases in favor of fairness and consistency.</description>

      <title>Scalable Equilibrium Sampling with Sequential Boltzmann Generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable sampling of molecular states in thermodynamic equilibrium is a long-standing challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann generators tackle this problem by pairing normalizing flows with importance sampling to obtain uncorrelated samples under the target distribution. In this paper, we extend the Boltzmann generator framework with two key contributions, denoting our framework Sequential Boltzmann generators (SBG). The first is a highly efficient Transformer-based normalizing flow operating directly on all-atom Cartesian coordinates. In contrast to the equivariant continuous flows of prior methods, we leverage exactly invertible non-equivariant architectures which are highly efficient during both sample generation and likelihood evaluation. This efficiency unlocks more sophisticated inference strategies beyond standard importance sampling. In particular, we perform inference-time scaling of flow samples using a continuous-time variant of sequential Monte Carlo, in which flow samples are transported towards the target distribution with annealed Langevin dynamics. SBG achieves state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. all metrics on peptide systems, demonstrating the first equilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of tri-, tetra- and hexa-peptides that were thus far intractable for prior Boltzmann generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various vision tasks. However, they tend to underperform on smaller datasets due to their inherent lack of inductive biases. Current approaches address this limitation implicitly-often by pairing ViTs with pretext tasks or by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to strengthen the prior. In contrast, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a widely adopted self-supervised framework, are inherently structured to preserve topology and spatial organization, making them a promising candidate to directly address the limitations of ViTs in limited or small training datasets. Despite this potential, equipping SOMs with modern deep learning architectures remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a novel exploration on how Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can empower each other, aiming to bridge this critical research gap. Our findings demonstrate that these architectures can synergistically enhance each other, leading to significantly improved performance in both unsupervised and supervised tasks.

      <title>Dual-Domain Fusion for Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Labeled time-series data is often expensive and difficult to obtain, making it challenging to train accurate machine learning models for real-world applications such as anomaly detection or fault diagnosis. The scarcity of labeled samples limits model generalization and leaves valuable unlabeled data underutilized. We propose Dual-Domain Fusion (DDF), a new model-agnostic semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework applicable to any time-series signal. DDF performs dual-domain training by combining the one-dimensional time-domain signals with their two-dimensional time-frequency representations and fusing them to maximize learning performance. Its tri-model architecture consists of time-domain, time-frequency, and fusion components, enabling the model to exploit complementary information across domains during training. To support practical deployment, DDF maintains the same inference cost as standard time-domain models by discarding the time-frequency and fusion branches at test time. Experimental results on two public fault diagnosis datasets demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements of 8-46% over widely used SSL methods FixMatch, MixMatch, Mean Teacher, Adversarial Training, and Self-training. These results show that DDF provides an effective and generalizable strategy for semi-supervised time-series classification.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning: A New Trustworthy and Privacy-Preserving Distributed Learning Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, despite its many advantages, FL still contends with significant challenges -- most notably regarding security and trust. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer a potential solution by establishing trust and enhancing system integrity throughout the FL process. Although several studies have explored ZKP-based FL (ZK-FL), a systematic framework and comprehensive analysis are still lacking. This article makes two key contributions. First, we propose a structured ZK-FL framework that categorizes and analyzes the technical roles of ZKPs across various FL stages and tasks. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm, Verifiable Client Selection FL (Veri-CS-FL), which employs ZKPs to refine the client selection process. In Veri-CS-FL, participating clients generate verifiable proofs for the performance metrics of their local models and submit these concise proofs to the server for efficient verification. The server then selects clients with high-quality local models for uploading, subsequently aggregating the contributions from these selected clients. By integrating ZKPs, Veri-CS-FL not only ensures the accuracy of performance metrics but also fortifies trust among participants while enhancing the overall efficiency and security of FL systems.</description>

      <title>The Case for "Thick Evaluations" of Cultural Representation in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI model outputs have been increasingly evaluated for their (in)ability to represent non-Western cultures. We argue that these evaluations often operate through reductive ideals of representation, abstracted from how people define their own representation and neglecting the inherently interpretive and contextual nature of cultural representation. In contrast to these 'thin' evaluations, we introduce the idea of 'thick evaluations:' a more granular, situated, and discursive measurement framework for evaluating representations of social worlds in AI outputs, steeped in communities' own understandings of representation. We develop this evaluation framework through workshops in South Asia, by studying the 'thick' ways in which people interpret and assign meaning to AI-generated images of their own cultures. We introduce practices for thicker evaluations of representation that expand the understanding of representation underpinning AI evaluations and by co-constructing metrics with communities, bringing measurement in line with the experiences of communities on the ground.</description>

      <title>ESPLoRA: Enhanced Spatial Precision with Low-Rank Adaption in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for High-Definition Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, producing high-quality, photorealistic images. However, they still struggle to properly render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing 3D spatial relations such as "in front of" or "behind". These metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms CoMPaSS, the current baseline framework, on spatial consistency benchmarks.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Vulnerability Analysis of NFT Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the NFT market, the security of smart contracts has become crucial. However, existing AI-based detection models for NFT contract vulnerabilities remain limited due to their complexity, while traditional manual methods are time-consuming and costly. This study proposes an AI-driven approach to detect vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts.
  We collected 16,527 public smart contract codes, classifying them into five vulnerability categories: Risky Mutable Proxy, ERC-721 Reentrancy, Unlimited Minting, Missing Requirements, and Public Burn. Python-processed data was structured into training/test sets. Using the CART algorithm with Gini coefficient evaluation, we built initial decision trees for feature extraction. A random forest model was implemented to improve robustness through random data/feature sampling and multitree integration. GridSearch hyperparameter tuning further optimized the model, with 3D visualizations demonstrating parameter impacts on vulnerability detection.
  Results show the random forest model excels in detecting all five vulnerabilities. For example, it identifies Risky Mutable Proxy by analyzing authorization mechanisms and state modifications, while ERC-721 Reentrancy detection relies on external call locations and lock mechanisms. The ensemble approach effectively reduces single-tree overfitting, with stable performance improvements after parameter tuning. This method provides an efficient technical solution for automated NFT contract detection and lays groundwork for scaling AI applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond Task and Motion Planning: Hierarchical Robot Planning with General-Purpose Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task and motion planning is a well-established approach for solving long-horizon robot planning problems. However, traditional methods assume that each task-level robot action, or skill, can be reduced to kinematic motion planning. We address the challenge of combining motion planning with closed-loop motor controllers that go beyond mere kinematic considerations. We propose a novel framework that integrates these policies into motion planning using Composable Interaction Primitives (CIPs), enabling the use of diverse, non-composable pre-learned skills in hierarchical robot planning. We validate our Task and Skill Planning (TASP) approach through real-world experiments on a bimanual manipulator and a mobile manipulator, demonstrating that CIPs allow diverse robots to combine motion planning with general-purpose skills to solve complex, long-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained spatial-temporal perception for gas leak segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation. Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation, we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</description>

      <title>Don't be lazy: CompleteP enables compute-efficient deep transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01618v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study compute efficiency of LLM training when using different parameterizations, i.e., rules for adjusting model and optimizer hyperparameters (HPs) as model size changes. Some parameterizations fail to transfer optimal base HPs (such as learning rate) across changes in model depth, requiring practitioners to either re-tune these HPs as they scale up (expensive), or accept sub-optimal training when re-tuning is prohibitive. Even when they achieve HP transfer, we develop theory to show parameterizations may still exist in the lazy learning regime where layers learn only features close to their linearization, preventing effective use of depth and nonlinearity. Finally, we identify and adopt the parameterization we call CompleteP that achieves both depth-wise HP transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers. CompleteP enables a wider range of model width/depth ratios to remain compute-efficient, unlocking shapes better suited for different hardware settings and operational contexts. Moreover, CompleteP enables 12-34% compute efficiency improvements over the prior state-of-the-art. All experiments were run on Cerebras CS-3 systems. A minimal implementation is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/nanoGPT-mup/tree/completep.</description>

      <title>ADMM-Based Training for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, the approximation introduced by the use of surrogate gradients leads to numerical imprecision, poor tracking of SNN firing times at training time, and, in turn, poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step function's non-differentiability by taking an entirely new approach with respect to gradient backpropagation. For the first time, we formulate the SNN training problem as an ADMM-based iterative optimization, derive closed-form updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence, its great potential, and discuss future and promising research directions to improve the method to different layer types and deeper architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantization Meets Reasoning: Exploring and Mitigating Degradation of Low-Bit LLMs in Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11574v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) is a practical route to deploy reasoning-capable LLMs under tight memory and latency budgets, yet it can markedly impair mathematical reasoning (drops up to 69.81% in our harder settings). We address two deployment-critical questions with process-level precision: Where along a step-structured solution does degradation first arise? How to mitigate it while staying in the low-bit regime? Across widely used PTQ methods (AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant), open-source model families (Qwen, LLaMA; 0.5--7B), and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, AIME), we perform format-aligned chain-of-thought with step-aligned attribution and uncover two robust regularities: (i) PTQ disproportionately elevates method and execution errors relative to high-level conceptual mistakes; and (ii) failures emerge early, with the first vulnerable step flipping and cascading to the final answer. These regularities suggest a general intervention principle: restore local token-level margins exactly at the earliest failure frontier. We instantiate this principle as a lightweight measure$\rightarrow$locate$\rightarrow$restore loop that operates directly on the quantized model: detect the first faulty step, construct our "Silver Bullet" datasets, and apply small-scale supervised/preference tuning. In our settings, as few as 332 curated examples and 3--5 minutes of compute on a single GPU recover 4-bit weight math reasoning toward the full-precision baseline while preserving PTQ efficiency. Our framework is quantizer- and architecture-agnostic within the evaluated regimes, and turns low-bit degradation from a global accuracy problem into a local, reproducible process intervention.</description>

      <title>Revitalizing Black-Box Interpretability: Actionable Interpretability for LLMs via Proxy Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-hoc explanations provide transparency and are essential for guiding model optimization, such as prompt engineering and data sanitation. However, applying model-agnostic techniques to Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by prohibitive computational costs, rendering these tools dormant for real-world applications. To revitalize model-agnostic interpretability, we propose a budget-friendly proxy framework that leverages efficient models to approximate the decision boundaries of expensive LLMs. We introduce a screen-and-apply mechanism to statistically verify local alignment before deployment. Our empirical evaluation confirms that proxy explanations achieve over 90% fidelity with only 11% of the oracle's cost. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate the actionable utility of our framework in prompt compression and poisoned example removal. Results show that reliable proxy explanations effectively guide optimization, transforming interpretability from a passive observation tool into a scalable primitive for LLM development. Additionally, we open-source code and datasets to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Seek in the Dark: Reasoning via Test-Time Instance-Level Policy Gradient in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning ability, a core component of human intelligence, continues to pose a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the pursuit of AGI. Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law, significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating. Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA) within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures. Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging within a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also benefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of test-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a lightweight, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Convergence in Private Stochastic Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding second-order stationary points (SOSP) in differentially private (DP) stochastic non-convex optimization. Existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) inaccurate convergence error rate due to overlooking gradient variance in the saddle point escape analysis, and (ii) dependence on auxiliary private model selection procedures for identifying DP-SOSP, which can significantly impair utility, particularly in distributed settings. To address these issues, we propose a generic perturbed stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) framework built upon Gaussian noise injection and general gradient oracles. A core innovation of our framework is using model drift distance to determine whether PSGD escapes saddle points, ensuring convergence to approximate local minima without relying on second-order information or additional DP-SOSP identification. By leveraging the adaptive DP-SPIDER estimator as a specific gradient oracle, we develop a new DP algorithm that rectifies the convergence error rates reported in prior work. We further extend this algorithm to distributed learning with heterogeneous data, providing the first formal guarantees for finding DP-SOSP in such settings. Our analysis also highlights the detrimental impacts of private selection procedures in distributed learning under high-dimensional models, underscoring the practical benefits of our design. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Head Attention Soft Random Forest for Interpretable Patient No-Show Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unattended scheduled appointments, defined as patient no-shows, adversely affect both healthcare providers and patients' health, disrupting the continuity of care, operational efficiency, and the efficient allocation of medical resources. Accurate predictive modeling is needed to reduce the impact of no-shows. Although machine learning methods, such as logistic regression, random forest models, and decision trees, are widely used in predicting patient no-shows, they often rely on hard decision splits and static feature importance, limiting their adaptability to specific or complex patient behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose a new hybrid Multi-Head Attention Soft Random Forest (MHASRF) model that integrates attention mechanisms into a random forest model using probabilistic soft splitting instead of hard splitting. The MHASRF model assigns attention weights differently across the trees, enabling attention on specific patient behaviors. The model exhibited 93.72% accuracy, 94.77% specificity, 90.23% precision, 89.38% recall, a 91.54% F1 score and AUC 97.87%, demonstrated high and balance performance across metrics, outperforming decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and naive bayes models overall. Furthermore, MHASRF was able to identify key predictors of patient no-shows using two levels of feature importance (tree level and attention mechanism level), offering deeper insights into patient no-show predictors. The proposed model is a robust, adaptable, and interpretable method for predicting patient no-shows that will help healthcare providers in optimizing resources.</description>

      <title>EVADE-Bench: Multimodal Benchmark for Evasive Content Detection in E-Commerce Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: E-commerce platforms increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to detect illicit or misleading product content. However, these models remain vulnerable to evasive content: inputs (text or images) that superficially comply with platform policies while covertly conveying prohibited claims. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks that induce overt failures, evasive content exploits ambiguity and context, making it far harder to detect. Existing robustness benchmarks provide little guidance for this demanding, real-world challenge. We introduce EVADE, the first expert-curated, Chinese, multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate foundation models on evasive content detection in e-commerce. The dataset contains 2,833 annotated text samples and 13,961 images spanning six demanding product categories, including body shaping, height growth, and health supplements. Two complementary tasks assess distinct capabilities: Single-Violation, which probes fine-grained reasoning under short prompts, and All-in-One, which tests long-context reasoning by merging overlapping policy rules into unified instructions. Notably, the All-in-One setting significantly narrows the performance gap between partial and full-match accuracy, suggesting that clearer rule definitions improve alignment between human and model judgment. We benchmark 26 mainstream LLMs and VLMs and observe substantial performance gaps: even state-of-the-art models frequently misclassify evasive samples. By releasing EVADE and strong baselines, we provide the first rigorous standard for evaluating evasive-content detection, expose fundamental limitations in current multimodal reasoning, and lay the groundwork for safer and more transparent content moderation systems in e-commerce. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/koenshen/EVADE-Bench.</description>

      <title>Knot So Simple: A Minimalistic Environment for Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose KnotGym, an interactive environment for complex, spatial reasoning and manipulation. KnotGym includes goal-oriented rope manipulation tasks with varying levels of complexity, all requiring acting from pure image observations. Tasks are defined along a clear and quantifiable axis of complexity based on the number of knot crossings, creating a natural generalization test. KnotGym has a simple observation space, allowing for scalable development, yet it highlights core challenges in integrating acute perception, spatial reasoning, and grounded manipulation. We evaluate methods of different classes, including model-based RL, model-predictive control, and chain-of-thought reasoning, and illustrate the challenges KnotGym presents. KnotGym is available at https://github.com/lil-lab/knotgym.</description>

      <title>Position: Foundation Models for Tabular Data within Systemic Contexts Need Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This position paper argues that foundation models for tabular data face inherent limitations when isolated from operational context - the procedural logic, declarative rules, and domain knowledge that define how data is created and governed. Current approaches focus on single-table generalization or schema-level relationships, fundamentally missing the operational knowledge that gives data meaning. We introduce Semantically Linked Tables (SLT) and Foundation Models for SLT (FMSLT) as a new model class that grounds tabular data in its operational context. We propose dual-phase training: pre-training on open-source code-data pairs and synthetic systems to learn business logic mechanics, followed by zero-shot inference on proprietary data. We introduce the ``Operational Turing Test'' benchmark and argue that operational grounding is essential for autonomous agents in complex data environments.</description>

      <title>StructEval: Benchmarking LLMs' Capabilities to Generate Structural Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to software development workflows, their ability to generate structured outputs has become critically important. We introduce StructEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in producing both non-renderable (JSON, YAML, CSV) and renderable (HTML, React, SVG) structured formats. Unlike prior benchmarks, StructEval systematically evaluates structural fidelity across diverse formats through two paradigms: 1) generation tasks, producing structured output from natural language prompts, and \textbf{2)} conversion tasks, translating between structured formats. Our benchmark encompasses 18 formats and 44 types of task, with novel metrics for format adherence and structural correctness. Results reveal significant performance gaps-even state-of-the-art models like o1-mini achieve only 75.58 average score, with open-source alternatives lagging approximately 10 points behind. We find generation tasks more challenging than conversion tasks, and producing correct visual content more difficult than generating text-only structures.</description>

      <title>SpecExtend: A Drop-in Enhancement for Speculative Decoding of Long Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely used technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades as input length grows, with significant drops even at moderate lengths. Yet, this early degradation has remained largely underexplored. We introduce SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves speculative decoding on long sequences without additional training. SpecExtend integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid Tree Attention to accelerate prefill and verification steps. To improve both draft accuracy and speed on long inputs without retraining, we propose Cross-model Retrieval, a novel KV cache eviction strategy that leverages the target model's attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the smaller draft model. Extensive evaluations show that SpecExtend accelerates speculative decoding by up to 2.84x on 16K-token long document summarization and up to 3.86x on long-form reasoning, while preserving the short-input performance of state-of-the-art frameworks. Our code is available at https://github.com/jycha98/SpecExtend .</description>

      <title>BLUCK: A Benchmark Dataset for Bengali Linguistic Understanding and Cultural Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce BLUCK, a new dataset designed to measure the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Bengali linguistic understanding and cultural knowledge. Our dataset comprises 2366 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) carefully curated from compiled collections of several college and job level examinations and spans 23 categories covering knowledge on Bangladesh's culture and history and Bengali linguistics. We benchmarked BLUCK using 6 proprietary and 3 open-source LLMs - including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, and DeepSeekV3. Our results show that while these models perform reasonably well overall, they, however, struggles in some areas of Bengali phonetics. Although current LLMs' performance on Bengali cultural and linguistic contexts is still not comparable to that of mainstream languages like English, our results indicate Bengali's status as a mid-resource language. Importantly, BLUCK is also the first MCQ-based evaluation benchmark that is centered around native Bengali culture, history, and linguistics.</description>

      <title>Universal Harmful Information Synthesis via Model Crowdsourcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To construct responsible and secure AI applications, harmful information data is widely utilized for adversarial testing and the development of safeguards. Existing studies mainly leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize data to obtain high-quality task datasets at scale, thereby avoiding costly human annotation. However, limited by the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs, the synthesis of harmful data still faces challenges in generation reliability and content diversity. In this study, we propose a novel harmful information synthesis framework, SwarmLaunder, which applies the model crowdsourcing strategy to generate diverse harmful data while maintaining a high success rate. Specifically, we generate abundant benign data as the based templates in a counterfactual manner. Subsequently, we decompose each based template into multiple semantic units and perform unit-by-unit toxification and final refinement through dynamic model switching, thus ensuring the success of synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that SwarmLaunder achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing different categories of harmful data with high scalability and diversity.</description>

      <title>Federated Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) to Unsupervised Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster centroid alignment across distributed clients, an inherently difficult task under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To address this, we propose FUSS (Federated Unsupervised image Semantic Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL algorithms under varying client data distributions. To fully support reproducibility, the source code, data partitioning scripts, and implementation details are publicly available at: https://github.com/evanchar/FUSS</description>

      <title>Boosting In-Context Learning in LLMs Through the Lens of Classical Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with just a few examples, but their predictions often suffer from systematic biases, leading to unstable performances in classification. While calibration techniques are proposed to mitigate these biases, we show that, in the logit space, many of these methods are equivalent to merely shifting the LLM's decision boundary without having the ability to alter its orientation. This proves inadequate when biases cause the LLM to be severely misdirected. To address these limitations and provide a unifying framework, we propose Supervised Calibration (SC), a loss-minimization based framework which learns an optimal, per-class affine transformation of the LLM's predictive probabilities in the logit space without requiring external data beyond the context. By using a more expressive functional class, SC not only subsumes many existing calibration methods in ICL as special cases, but also enables the ability to alter and even completely reverse the orientation of the LLM's decision boundary. Furthermore, SC's loss-based nature facilitates the seamless integration of two purpose-built regularization techniques: context-invariance and directional trust-region. The former is designed to tackle the instability issue in ICL, while the latter controls the degree of calibration. Finally, SC delivers state-of-the-art performance over calibration baselines in the 4-shot, 8-shot, and 16-shot settings across all nine datasets for Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, LLaMA-2-7B-chat, and Qwen2-7B-Instruct.</description>

      <title>XMAD-Bench: Cross-Domain Multilingual Audio Deepfake Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes, making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft, and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue, with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can be tested "in the wild". Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors, which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at https://github.com/ristea/xmad-bench/.</description>

      <title>MoA: Heterogeneous Mixture of Adapters for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance, which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach. This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants: \textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA} activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance and parameter efficiency.

      <title>CulturalFrames: Assessing Cultural Expectation Alignment in Text-to-Image Models and Evaluation Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts -- where missed cues can stereotype communities and undermine usability. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit (stated) as well as implicit (unstated, implied by the prompt's cultural context) cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we show that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, provide a concrete testbed, and outline actionable directions for developing culturally informed T2I models and metrics that improve global usability.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Geology: Structural Geology Meets Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the structural geology and mineral composition of the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface from sparse or indirect surface observations remains a long-standing challenge with critical applications in mineral exploration, geohazard assessment, and geotechnical engineering. This inherently ill-posed problem is often addressed by classical geophysical inversion methods, which typically yield a single maximum-likelihood model that fails to capture the full range of plausible geology. The adoption of modern deep learning methods has been limited by the lack of large 3D training datasets. We address this gap with \textit{StructuralGeo}, a geological simulation engine that mimics eons of tectonic, magmatic, and sedimentary processes to generate a virtually limitless supply of realistic synthetic 3D lithological models. Using this dataset, we train both unconditional and conditional generative flow-matching models with a 3D attention U-Net architecture. The resulting foundation model can reconstruct multiple plausible 3D scenarios from surface topography and sparse borehole data, depicting structures such as layers, faults, folds, and dikes. By sampling many reconstructions from the same observations, we introduce a probabilistic framework for estimating the size and extent of subsurface features. While the realism of the output is bounded by the fidelity of the training data to true geology, this combination of simulation and generative AI functions offers a flexible prior for probabilistic modeling, regional fine-tuning, and use as an AI-based regularizer in traditional geophysical inversion workflows.</description>

      <title>The CAISAR Platform: Extending the Reach of Machine Learning Specification and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formal specification and verification of machine learning programs saw remarkable progress in less than a decade, leading to a profusion of tools. However, diversity may lead to fragmentation, resulting in tools that are difficult to compare, except for very specific benchmarks. Furthermore, this progress is heavily geared towards the specification and verification of a certain class of property, that is, local robustness properties. But while provers are becoming more and more efficient at solving local robustness properties, even slightly more complex properties, involving multiple neural networks for example, cannot be expressed in the input languages of winners of the International Competition of Verification of Neural Networks VNN-Comp. In this tool paper, we present CAISAR, an open-source platform dedicated to machine learning specification and verification. We present its specification language, suitable for modelling complex properties on neural networks, support vector machines and boosted trees. We show on concrete use-cases how specifications written in this language are automatically translated to queries to state-of-the-art provers, notably by using automated graph editing techniques, making it possible to use their off-the-shelf versions. The artifact to reproduce the paper claims is available at the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15209510</description>

      <title>Challenges &amp; Opportunities with LLM-Assisted Visualization Retargeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of visualization examples published on the web, retargeting existing custom chart implementations to new datasets remains difficult, time-intensive, and tedious. The adaptation process assumes author familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity, categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.</description>

      <title>SoK: On the Survivability of Backdoor Attacks on Unconstrained Face Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01607v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Deep Learning-based Face Recognition Systems raises many security concerns. While prior research has identified backdoor vulnerabilities on isolated components, Backdoor Attacks on real-world, unconstrained pipelines remain underexplored. This SoK paper presents the first comprehensive system-level analysis and measurement of the impact of Backdoor Attacks on fully-fledged Face Recognition Systems. We combine the existing Supervised Learning backdoor literature targeting face detectors, face antispoofing, and face feature extractors to demonstrate a system-level vulnerability. By analyzing 20 pipeline configurations and 15 attack scenarios in a holistic manner, we reveal that an attacker only needs a single backdoored model to compromise an entire Face Recognition System. Finally, we discuss the impact of such attacks and propose best practices and countermeasures for stakeholders.</description>

      <title>K-Function: Joint Pronunciation Transcription and Feedback for Evaluating Kids Language Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating young children's language is challenging for automatic speech recognizers due to high-pitched voices, prolonged sounds, and limited data. We introduce K-Function, a framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription with objective, Large Language Model (LLM)-driven scoring. Its core, Kids-Weighted Finite State Transducer (K-WFST), merges an acoustic phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity model to capture child-specific speech errors while remaining fully interpretable. K-WFST achieves a 1.39 % phoneme error rate on MyST and 8.61 % on Multitudes-an absolute improvement of 10.47 % and 7.06 % over a greedy-search decoder. These high-quality transcripts are used by an LLM to grade verbal skills, developmental milestones, reading, and comprehension, with results that align closely with human evaluators. Our findings show that precise phoneme recognition is essential for creating an effective assessment framework, enabling scalable language screening for children.</description>

      <title>CoRe: Benchmarking LLMs Code Reasoning Capabilities through Static Analysis Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across diverse domains of software engineering, such as code generation, program repair, and vulnerability detection. These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code patterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program elements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes, such as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models' ability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CORE, a high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on fundamental static analysis tasks. CORE includes 12,553 task instances spanning data dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs written in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning complexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects targets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth. We evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at identifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper semantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative analyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and backward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Naturally Mitigates Forgetting in Continual Post-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.</description>

      <title>Aligning Generative Speech Enhancement with Perceptual Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based speech enhancement (SE) has recently emerged as a promising direction, but existing approaches predominantly rely on token-level likelihood objectives that weakly reflect human perception. This mismatch limits progress, as optimizing signal accuracy does not always improve naturalness or listening comfort. We address this gap by introducing a perceptually aligned LM-based SE approach. Our method applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with UTMOS, a neural MOS predictor, as a proxy for human ratings, directly steering models toward perceptually preferred outputs. This design directly connects model training to perceptual quality and is broadly applicable within LM-based SE frameworks. On the Deep Noise Suppression Challenge 2020 test sets, our approach consistently improves speech quality metrics, achieving relative gains of up to 56%. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of perceptual feedback into LM-based SE and the first application of DPO in the SE domain, establishing a new paradigm for perceptually aligned enhancement with SE.</description>

      <title>KisMATH: Do LLMs Have Knowledge of Implicit Structures in Mathematical Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces have been shown to improve performance of large language models on a plethora of reasoning tasks, yet there is no consensus on the mechanism by which this boost is achieved. To shed more light on this, we introduce Causal CoT Graphs (CCGraphs), which are directed acyclic graphs automatically extracted from reasoning traces that model fine-grained causal dependencies in language-model outputs. A collection of 1671 mathematical reasoning problems from MATH500, GSM8K, and AIME, together with their associated CCGraphs, has been compiled into our dataset -- KisMATH. Our detailed empirical analysis with 15 open-weight LLMs shows that (i) reasoning nodes in the CCGraphs are causal contributors to the final answer, which we argue is constitutive of reasoning; and (ii) LLMs emphasize the reasoning paths captured by the CCGraphs, indicating that the models internally realize structures similar to our graphs. KisMATH enables controlled, graph-aligned interventions and opens avenues for further investigation into the role of CoT in LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>AI-Native Open RAN for Non-Terrestrial Networks: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial network (NTN) is envisioned as a critical component of Sixth Generation (6G) networks by enabling ubiquitous services and enhancing network resilience. However, the inherent mobility and high-altitude operation of NTN pose significant challenges throughout the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle. To address these challenges, integrating NTNs with the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) is a promising approach, since ORAN can offer disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and embedded intelligence. Despite extensive literature on ORAN and NTN, a holistic view of ORAN-based NTN frameworks is still lacking, particularly regarding how ORAN can effectively address the existing challenges of NTN. Furthermore, although artificial intelligence native (AI-Native) capabilities have the potential to enhance intelligence network control and optimization, their practical realization in NTNs has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of AI-Native ORAN for NTN. This paper commences with an in-depth review of the existing literature and subsequently introduces the necessary background about ORAN, NTN, and AI-Native for communication. After analyzing the DevOps challenges for NTN, we propose the orchestrated AI-Native ORAN-based NTN framework and discuss its key technological enablers. Finally, we present the representative use cases and outline the prospective future research directions of this study.</description>

      <title>SHACL Validation in the Presence of Ontologies: Semantics and Rewriting Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SHACL and OWL are two prominent W3C standards for managing RDF data. These languages share many features, but they have one fundamental difference: OWL, designed for inferring facts from incomplete data, makes the open-world assumption, whereas SHACL is a constraint language that treats the data as complete and must be validated under the closed-world assumption. The combination of both formalisms is very appealing and has been called for, but their semantic gap is a major challenge, semantically and computationally. In this paper, we advocate a semantics for SHACL validation in the presence of ontologies based on core universal models. We provide a technique for constructing these models for ontologies in the rich data-tractable description logic Horn-ALCHIQ. Furthermore, we use a finite representation of this model to develop a rewriting technique that reduces SHACL validation in the presence of ontologies to standard validation. Finally, we study the complexity of SHACL validation in the presence of ontologies, and show that even very simple ontologies make the problem EXPTIME-complete, and PTIME-complete in data complexity.</description>

      <title>Shared representations in brains and models reveal a two-route cortical organization during scene perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain transforms visual inputs into high-dimensional cortical representations that support diverse cognitive and behavioral goals. Characterizing how this information is organized and routed across the human brain is essential for understanding how we process complex visual scenes. Here, we applied representational similarity analysis to 7T fMRI data collected during natural scene viewing. We quantified representational geometry shared across individuals and compared it to hierarchical features from vision and language neural networks. This analysis revealed two distinct processing routes: a ventromedial pathway specialized for scene layout and environmental context, and a lateral occipitotemporal pathway selective for animate content. Vision models aligned with shared structure in both routes, whereas language models corresponded primarily with the lateral pathway. These findings refine classical visual-stream models by characterizing scene perception as a distributed cortical network with separable representational routes for context and animate content.</description>

      <title>Paired Image Generation with Diffusion-Guided Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions, which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges. First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second, existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method. The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions. Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

      <title>Development and Evaluation of a Standardized Ontology for Non-Invasive Respiratory Support to Improve Interoperability and Clinical Reasoning in Acute Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Managing patients with respiratory failure increasingly involves noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS) strategies to support respiration, often preventing the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. However, despite the rapidly expanding use of NIRS, there remains a significant challenge to its optimal use across all medical circumstances. It lacks a unified ontological structure, complicating guidance on NIRS modalities across healthcare systems. This study introduced NIRS ontology to support knowledge representation in acute care settings by providing a unified framework that enhances data clarity and interoperability, laying the groundwork for future clinical decision-making. We developed NIRS ontology using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding a sample of 6 patient scenarios and used SPARQL queries to retrieve and test targeted inferences. The ontology has 145 classes, 11 object properties, and 18 data properties across 949 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 392 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL query evaluations across clinical scenarios confirmed the ontology ability to support rulebased reasoning and therapy recommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices, integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes. In conclusion, we unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Verification-Centric Framework for Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-Modal RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn (CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Breezelled/KDD-Cup-2025-Meta-CRAG-MM .</description>

      <title>MaPPO: Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization with Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Financial NLP: A Comparative Study on Financial Report Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22936</link>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support the analysis of complex financial disclosures, yet their reliability, behavioral consistency, and transparency remain insufficiently understood in high-stakes settings. This paper presents a controlled evaluation of five transformer-based LLMs applied to question answering over the Business sections of U.S. 10-K filings. To capture complementary aspects of model behavior, we combine human evaluation, automated similarity metrics, and behavioral diagnostics under standardized and context-controlled prompting conditions. Human assessments indicate that models differ in their average performance across qualitative dimensions such as relevance, completeness, clarity, conciseness, and factual accuracy, though inter-rater agreement is modest, reflecting the subjective nature of these criteria. Automated metrics reveal systematic differences in lexical overlap and semantic similarity across models, while behavioral diagnostics highlight variation in response stability and cross-prompt alignment. Importantly, no single model consistently dominates across all evaluation perspectives. Together, these findings suggest that apparent performance differences should be interpreted as relative tendencies under the tested conditions rather than definitive indicators of general reliability. The results underscore the need for evaluation frameworks that account for human disagreement, behavioral variability, and interpretability when deploying LLMs in financially consequential applications.</description>

      <title>Large AI Model-Enabled Secure Communications in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: Concepts, Perspectives and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have the potential to revolutionize communications by supporting a range of applications, including urban parcel delivery, aerial inspections and air taxis. However, compared with traditional wireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude operations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it more vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some large artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure communications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security risks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we introduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in addressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for secure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced state features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic rewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for secure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline future directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications.</description>

      <title>Wukong Framework for Not Safe For Work Detection in Text-to-Image systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC) technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based TCP Congestion Control Algorithm: Design, Simulation, and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based TCP congestion-control algorithm that uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to adapt the congestion window (cWnd) dynamically based on observed network state. The proposed approach utilizes DQNs to optimize the congestion window by observing key network parameters and taking real-time actions. The algorithm is trained and evaluated within the NS-3 network simulator using the OpenGym interface. The results demonstrate that the DRL-based algorithm provides a superior balance between throughput and latency compared to both traditional TCP New Reno and TCP Cubic algorithms. Specifically: Compared to TCP Cubic, the DRL algorithm achieved comparable throughput (statistically insignificant difference of -3.79%, $p&gt;0.05$) while delivering a massive 46.29% reduction in Round-Trip Time (RTT). Furthermore, the DRL agent maintained near-zero packet loss, whereas Cubic suffered from significant buffer overflow. Compared to TCP New Reno, the DRL algorithm achieved comparable throughput (+0.38%) with a 32.40% reduction in RTT. Results from NS-3 simulations indicate that the proposed DRL agent effectively mitigates bufferbloat without compromising bandwidth utilization. This study emphasizes the potential of reinforcement learning techniques for solving complex congestion control problems in modern networks by learning the network capacity rather than saturating it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) are transforming wireless physical layer technologies through their robust generalization, multitask processing, and multimodal capabilities. This article reviews recent advancements in applying LAMs to physical layer communications, addressing obstacles of conventional AI-based approaches. LAM-based solutions are classified into two strategies: leveraging pre-trained LAMs and developing native LAMs designed specifically for physical layer tasks. The motivations and key frameworks of these approaches are comprehensively examined through multiple use cases. Both strategies significantly improve performance and adaptability across diverse wireless scenarios. Future research directions, including efficient architectures, interpretability, standardized datasets, and collaboration between large and small models, are proposed to advance LAM-based physical layer solutions for next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>SmallKV: Small Model Assisted Compensation of KV Cache Compression for Efficient LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM inference in resource constrained environments.</description>

      <title>RCP-Merging: Merging Long Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning Capability as Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability, termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and 9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original long CoT reasoning capability.</description>

      <title>HierarchicalPrune: Position-Aware Compression for Large-Scale Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation: DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements. HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the quality of the output images. Specifically, combined with INT4 weight quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction (e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Finally, our comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model while significantly outperforming prior works.</description>

      <title>AttriLens-Mol: Attribute Guided Reinforcement Learning for Molecular Property Prediction with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process, their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol, an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1) a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models (Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and performance for property prediction. We release the code in https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.</description>

      <title>Transferable Model-agnostic Vision-Language Model Adaptation for Efficient Weak-to-Strong Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance 'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained, this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain, often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>SPHENIC: Topology-Aware Multi-View Clustering for Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics clustering is pivotal for identifying cell subpopulations by leveraging spatial location information. While recent graph-based methods modeling cell-cell interactions have improved clustering accuracy, they remain limited in two key aspects: (i) reliance on local aggregation in static graphs often fails to capture robust global topological structures (e.g., loops and voids) and is vulnerable to noisy edges; and (ii) dimensionality reduction techniques frequently neglect spatial coherence, causing physically adjacent spots to be erroneously separated in the latent space. To overcome these challenges, we propose SPHENIC, a Spatial Persistent Homology-Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, it explicitly incorporates topology-invariant features into the clustering network to ensure robust representation learning against noise. Furthermore, we design a dual-regularized optimization module that imposes spatial constraints alongside distributional optimization, ensuring that the embedding space preserves the physical proximity of cells. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPHENIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.19%-9.14%, validating its superiority in characterizing complex tissue architectures.</description>

      <title>ToxiFrench: Benchmarking and Enhancing Language Models via CoT Fine-Tuning for French Toxicity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting toxic content using language models is crucial yet challenging. While substantial progress has been made in English, toxicity detection in French remains underdeveloped, primarily due to the lack of culturally relevant, human-annotated, large-scale datasets. In this work, we release ToxiFrench, a dataset of 53,622 French online comments together with a balanced benchmark split for systematic evaluation. The dataset is constructed via a semi-automated annotation pipeline that reduces manual labeling to only 10% through high-confidence LLM-based pre-annotation and human verification, while ensuring statistical alignment with human-only annotation. We then benchmark a broad range of models and uncover a counterintuitive finding: Small Language Models (SLMs) often surpass larger models in robustness and generalization on this task. Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy using a Dynamic Weighted Loss (DWL) that progressively emphasizes the model's final decision and significantly improves faithfulness. Our fine-tuned 4B model (Qwen3-4B) achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark. It improves its balanced accuracy by 10% over its baseline and achieves better performance than GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on our benchmark, while successfully retaining cross-lingual capabilities.</description>

      <title>Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained, post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably, each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction, or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals. This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.</description>

      <title>SurGE: A Benchmark and Evaluation Framework for Scientific Survey Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of academic literature makes the manual creation of scientific surveys increasingly infeasible. While large language models show promise for automating this process, progress in this area is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new benchmark for scientific survey generation in computer science. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers. In addition, we propose an automated evaluation framework that measures the quality of generated surveys across four dimensions: comprehensiveness, citation accuracy, structural organization, and content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based methods demonstrates a significant performance gap, revealing that even advanced agentic frameworks struggle with the complexities of survey generation and highlighting the need for future research in this area. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE</description>

      <title>Amortized Sampling with Transferable Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in full for each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has inspired interest towards overcoming this limitation through learning sampling algorithms. Despite performing competitively with conventional methods when trained on a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to transfer across systems. We demonstrate that deep learning enables the design of scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 285 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems, achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length, whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows. Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve competitive performance to established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo. We open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Safety Tax: Mitigating Unsafe Text-to-Image Generation via External Safety Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, yet remain vulnerable to generating unsafe content. Existing safety defenses typically intervene internally within the generative model, but suffer from severe concept entanglement, leading to degradation of benign generation quality, a trade-off we term the Safety Tax. To overcome this limitation, we advocate a paradigm shift from destructive internal editing to external safety rectification. Following this principle, we propose SafePatch, a structurally isolated safety module that performs external, interpretable rectification without modifying the base model. The core backbone of SafePatch is architecturally instantiated as a trainable clone of the base model's encoder, allowing it to inherit rich semantic priors and maintain representation consistency. To enable interpretable safety rectification, we construct a strictly aligned counterfactual safety dataset (ACS) for differential supervision training. Across nudity and multi-category benchmarks and recent adversarial prompt attacks, SafePatch achieves robust unsafe suppression (7% unsafe on I2P) while preserving image quality and semantic alignment.</description>

      <title>Lightning Fast Caching-based Parallel Denoising Prediction for Accelerating Talking Head Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications. Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions. Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves inference speed while preserving video quality.</description>

      <title>Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified View of Large Language Model Post-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate, and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and families.</description>

      <title>Learned Hallucination Detection in Black-Box LLMs using Token-level Entropy Production Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering (QA) tasks can critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper introduces a methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection, specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR) that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised learning. Our learned model leverages the entropic contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated sequence, without multiple re-runs per query. Evaluated across diverse QA datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves token-level hallucination detection over state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top-10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for API-constrained deployments. This work provides a lightweight technique to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses, at the token level, after a single generation pass, for QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our experiments confirmed the performance of our method against existing approaches on public dataset as well as for a financial framework analyzing annual company reports.</description>

      <title>ProtSAE: Disentangling and Interpreting Protein Language Models via Semantically-Guided Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic interpretability of large language models. Recent works apply SAE to protein language models (PLMs), aiming to extract and analyze biologically meaningful features from their latent spaces. However, SAE suffers from semantic entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts, making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors. In this paper, we propose a semantically-guided SAE, called ProtSAE. Unlike existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in interpretable probing. We also show the potential of ProtSAE in steering PLMs for downstream generation tasks.</description>

      <title>AI-in-the-Loop: Privacy Preserving Real-Time Scam Detection and Conversational Scambaiting by Leveraging LLMs and Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05362v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing, impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.</description>

      <title>Quantum spatial best-arm identification via quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning has emerged as a framework combining quantum computation with sequential decision-making, and applications to the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem have been reported. The graph bandit problem extends the MAB setting by introducing spatial constraints, yet quantum approaches remain limited. We propose a quantum algorithmic framework for best-arm identification in graph bandits, termed Quantum Spatial Best-Arm Identification (QSBAI), which is applicable to general graph structures. The method employs quantum walks to encode superpositions over graph-constrained actions, extending amplitude amplification and generalizing the Quantum BAI algorithm via Szegedy's walk framework. This establishes a link between Grover-type search and reinforcement learning tasks with structural restrictions. We focus our theoretical analysis on complete and bipartite graphs, deriving the maximal success probability of identifying the best arm and the time step at which it is achieved. Our results highlight the potential of quantum walks to accelerate exploration in constrained environments and extend the applicability of quantum algorithms for decision-making.</description>

      <title>Building Large-Scale English-Romanian Literary Translation Resources with Open Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for dataset creation, fine-tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine-tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large-scale synthetic parallel datasets (DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for rich, high-quality literary datasets in low-resource languages such as Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high-quality Romanian references from the TF1 pool using a high-performing LLM. We then apply a two-stage fine-tuning process to a 12B-parameter open-weight model: (i) instruction tuning to capture genre-specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus-level BLEU and a five-dimension LLM-based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results show that our fine-tuned model achieves strong fluency and adequacy, narrowing the gap to top-performing proprietary models under automated and human-anchored evaluation, while being open, accessible, and significantly more cost-effective. Alongside the finetuned model, and both datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost-efficient translation, cross-lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open models for culturally significant literary content in low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>Vejde: A Framework for Inductive Deep Reinforcement Learning Based on Factor Graph Color Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction, graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL, with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score. Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.</description>

      <title>Predictive Spike Timing Enables Distributed Shortest Path Computation in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient planning and sequence selection are central to intelligence, yet current approaches remain largely incompatible with biological computation. Classical graph algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* require global state and biologically implausible operations such as backtracing, while reinforcement learning methods rely on slow gradient-based policy updates that appear inconsistent with rapid behavioral adaptation observed in natural systems.
  We propose a biologically plausible algorithm for shortest-path computation that operates through local spike-based message-passing with realistic processing delays. The algorithm exploits spike-timing coincidences to identify nodes on optimal paths: Neurons that receive inhibitory-excitatory message pairs earlier than predicted reduce their response delays, creating a temporal compression that propagates backwards from target to source. Through analytical proof and simulations on random spatial networks, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges and discovers all shortest paths using purely timing-based mechanisms. By showing how short-term timing dynamics alone can compute shortest paths, this work provides new insights into how biological networks might solve complex computational problems through purely local computation and relative spike-time prediction. These findings open new directions for understanding distributed computation in biological and artificial systems, with possible implications for computational neuroscience, AI, reinforcement learning, and neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar, leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains. Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.</description>

      <title>SoundCompass: Navigating Target Sound Extraction With Effective Directional Clue Integration In Complex Acoustic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in target sound extraction (TSE) utilize directional clues derived from direction of arrival (DoA), which represent an inherent spatial property of sound available in any acoustic scene. However, previous DoA-based methods rely on hand-crafted features or discrete encodings, which lose fine-grained spatial information and limit adaptability. We propose SoundCompass, an effective directional clue integration framework centered on a Spectral Pairwise INteraction (SPIN) module that captures cross-channel spatial correlations in the complex spectrogram domain to preserve full spatial information in multichannel signals. The input feature expressed in terms of spatial correlations is fused with a DoA clue represented as spherical harmonics (SH) encoding. The fusion is carried out across overlapping frequency subbands, inheriting the benefits reported in the previous band-split architectures. We also incorporate the iterative refinement strategy, chain-of-inference (CoI), in the TSE framework, which recursively fuses DoA with sound event activation estimated from the previous inference stage. Experiments demonstrate that SoundCompass, combining SPIN, SH embedding, and CoI, robustly extracts target sources across diverse signal classes and spatial configurations.</description>

      <title>GeLoc3r: Enhancing Relative Camera Pose Regression with Geometric Consistency Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require 300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time, maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2 dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry, achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of correspondence methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Verifiable Federated Unlearning: Framework, Challenges, and The Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated unlearning (FUL) enables removing the data influence from the model trained across distributed clients, upholding the right to be forgotten as mandated by privacy regulations. FUL facilitates a value exchange where clients gain privacy-preserving control over their data contributions, while service providers leverage decentralized computing and data freshness. However, this entire proposition is undermined because clients have no reliable way to verify that their data influence has been provably removed, as current metrics and simple notifications offer insufficient assurance. We envision unlearning verification becoming a pivotal and trust-by-design part of the FUL life-cycle development, essential for highly regulated and data-sensitive services and applications like healthcare. This article introduces veriFUL, a reference framework for verifiable FUL that formalizes verification entities, goals, approaches, and metrics. Specifically, we consolidate existing efforts and contribute new insights, concepts, and metrics to this domain. Finally, we highlight research challenges and identify potential applications and developments for verifiable FUL and veriFUL. This article aims to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners to navigate and advance the field of verifiable FUL.</description>

      <title>Signature-Informed Transformer for Asset Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern deep learning for asset allocation typically separates forecasting from optimization. We argue this creates a fundamental mismatch where minimizing prediction errors fails to yield robust portfolios. We propose the Signature Informed Transformer to address this by unifying feature extraction and decision making into a single policy. Our model employs path signatures to encode complex path dependencies and introduces a specialized attention mechanism that targets geometric asset relationships. By directly minimizing the Conditional Value at Risk we ensure the training objective aligns with financial goals. We prove that our attention module rigorously amplifies signature derived signals. Experiments across diverse equity universes show our approach significantly outperforms both traditional strategies and advanced forecasting baselines. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Signature-Informed-Transformer-For-Asset-Allocation-DB88</description>

      <title>Auditable Unit-Aware Thresholds in Symbolic Regression via Logistic-Gated Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI for health will only scale when models are not only accurate but also readable, auditable, and governable. Many clinical and public-health decisions hinge on numeric thresholds -- cut-points that trigger alarms, treatment, or follow-up -- yet most machine-learning systems bury those thresholds inside opaque scores or smooth response curves. We introduce logistic-gated operators (LGO) for symbolic regression, which promote thresholds to first-class, unit-aware parameters inside equations and map them back to physical units for direct comparison with guidelines. On public ICU and population-health cohorts (MIMIC-IV ICU, eICU, NHANES), LGO recovers clinically plausible gates on MAP, lactate, GCS, SpO2, BMI, fasting glucose, and waist circumference while remaining competitive with established scoring systems (AutoScore) and explainable boosting machines (EBM). The gates are sparse and selective: they appear when regime switching is supported by the data and are pruned on predominantly smooth tasks, yielding compact formulas that clinicians can inspect, stress-test, and revise. As a standalone symbolic model or a safety overlay on black-box systems, LGO helps translate observational data into auditable, unit-aware rules for medicine and other threshold-driven domains.</description>

      <title>CoT Referring: Improving Referring Expression Tasks with Grounded Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension and Segmentation are critical tasks for assessing the integration of language understanding and image comprehension, serving as benchmarks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a new strategy, CoT Referring, which enhances model reasoning across modalities through a structured, chain-of-thought training data structure. Our approach systematically parses textual structures to a sequential referring step, where in each step it identifies relationships and ensures consistent reference alignment, thereby improving accuracy in complex query scenarios. We restructure the training data to enforce a new output form, providing new annotations for existing datasets and compiling an evaluation benchmark from existing resources. This benchmark is designed explicitly for complex referring cases. We also integrate detection and segmentation capabilities into a unified MLLM framework, training it with a novel adaptive weighted loss to optimize performance. Experimental results on our curated benchmark and RefCOCO/+/g demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a notable increase of 2.5%+ over baseline models.</description>

      <title>LLMs Deceive Unintentionally: Emergent Misalignment in Dishonesty from Misaligned Samples to Biased Human-AI Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty. Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

      <title>Saving SWE-Bench: A Benchmark Mutation Approach for Realistic Agent Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios, especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents. Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks. In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent capabilities for some models by &gt;50% over baseline performance for public benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents through benchmark mutation techniques.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Influence: Tracing Interdependencies Across Time and Features in Clinical Predictive Modelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature interactions. CoI enables the tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a chronic kidney disease cohort. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance (AUROC of 0.960 on CKD progression and 0.950 on ICU mortality), with deletion-based sensitivity analyses confirming that CoI's learned attributions faithfully reflect its decision process. Through case studies, we demonstrate that CoI uncovers clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease progression, offering enhanced transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Entropy Interventions in RLVR: An Entropy Change Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM reasoning, its training process carries a critical risk: entropy collapse. This phenomenon is a rapid decrease in policy entropy, which severely limits exploration and diminishes learning effectiveness. Recent methods attempt to mitigate this collapse via heuristic entropy interventions, yet the underlying mechanisms governing entropy remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a theoretical and quantitative analysis of GRPO's entropy dynamics, revealing that token-level entropy change in each update step is jointly governed by four key factors: clipping strategy, advantage, token probability, and token entropy. These findings not only explain the mechanisms of existing methods, but also reveal their limitations: they rely on heuristic adjustments to only one or two factors, leaving other relevant factors unconsidered and reducing their effectiveness. This motivates us to propose a new method, STEER, which adaptively reweights tokens based on their estimated entropy change to regulate entropy in a principled manner. Experiments on both math and coding benchmarks demonstrate that STEER effectively mitigates entropy collapse and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Image-to-Video Transfer Learning based on Image-Language Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in vision-language understanding, providing transferable multimodal representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks. The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, termed as image-to-video transfer learning, effectively mitigates the substantial data and computational demands compared to training video-language models from scratch while achieves comparable or even stronger model performance. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFMs and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning techniques into two broad root categories (frozen features and adapted features), along with numerous fine-grained subcategories, based on the paradigm for transferring image understanding capability to video tasks. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained settings (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained ones (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

      <title>DocReward: A Document Reward Model for Structuring and Stylizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for readability and engagement. This gap stems mainly from a lack of effective reward models capable of guiding agents toward producing documents with high structural and stylistic professionalism. To address this, we propose DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their structure and style. The model is trained under a textual-quality-agnostic framework to assess professionalism without being influenced by textual quality. To achieve this, we construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each comprising a high- and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure and style. This setup enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively and independently of textual quality. DocReward is trained using the Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict the annotated ranking. On a manually annotated benchmark, DocReward outperforms GPT-5 by 14.6 percentage points in accuracy. Extrinsic RL experiments further validate its effectiveness in guiding professional document generation.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Consistency for Robust Test-Time LLM Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble methods. *Token-level consistency* captures fine-grained disagreements by applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at a granular level. *Model-level consistency* models global agreement by promoting model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others, enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhichenz98/CoRE-EACL26.</description>

      <title>Joint Discriminative-Generative Modeling via Dual Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent in Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD)-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by discriminating between real data and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-generated contrastive samples using the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training strategy that addresses normalization-related instabilities and enables leveraging pretrained robust classifiers, generalizing effectively across diverse architectures. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that our approach: (1) is the first EBM-based hybrid to scale to high-resolution datasets with high training stability, simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art discriminative and generative performance on ImageNet 256$\times$256; (2) uniquely combines generative quality with adversarial robustness, enabling critical applications like robust counterfactual explanations; and (3) functions as a competitive standalone generative model, matching the generative quality of autoregressive methods (VAR-d16) and surpassing diffusion models while offering unique versatility.</description>

      <title>From Prototypes to Sparse ECG Explanations: SHAP-Driven Counterfactuals for Multivariate Time-Series Multi-class Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining 81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection (13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (&lt; 1 second) of clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>The Dog the Cat Chased Stumped the Model: Measuring When Language Models Abandon Structure for Shortcuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed," are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720 comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning. Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to pattern matching.</description>

      <title>GRACE: Graph Neural Networks for Locus-of-Care Prediction under Extreme Class Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. In addition, we propose a new approach of obtaining an unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem. Experimental results with real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. Further, if we jointly finetune the base embedding fed into GRACE as input together with the rest of the GNN component of GRACE, there is a remarkable boost of 15.8% in performance.</description>

      <title>Perception, Understanding and Reasoning, A Multimodal Benchmark for Video Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced research on video fake news detection (VFND) tasks. Existing benchmarks typically focus on the detection accuracy, while failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the entire detection process. To address these limitations, we introduce {POVFNDB (Process-oriented Video Fake News Detection Benchmark)}, a process-oriented benchmark comprising 10 tasks designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' perception, understanding, and reasoning capabilities in VFND. This benchmark contains \textit{36,240} human-annotated question-answer (QA) in structured or open-ended formats, spanning 15 distinct evaluation dimensions that characterize different aspects of the video fake news detection process. Using POVFNDB, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on both proprietary and open-source MLLMs. Moreover, we establish a strong benchmark baseline by fine-tuning Qwen2.5VL-7B-Instruct on process-oriented chain-of-thought data constructed with our proposed POVFND-CoT framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VFND.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of UNet-based Architectures for Liver Tumor Segmentation in Multi-Phase Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25522v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. In this study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver tumor segmentation, evaluating ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones initialized with pretrained weights. Our comparative analysis reveals that despite the theoretical advantages of modern architectures in modeling long-range dependencies, ResNet-based models demonstrated superior sample efficiency on this dataset. This suggests that the inherent inductive biases of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain advantageous for generalizing on limited medical data compared to data-hungry alternatives. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone, finding that the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the optimal configuration. The ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM achieved the highest nominal performance with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, while also delivering the most precise boundary delineation (lowest HD95 of 77.911). Critically, while statistical testing indicated that the improvement in mean Dice score was not significant (p &gt; 0.05) compared to the baseline, the proposed model exhibited greater stability (lower standard deviation) and higher specificity (0.926). These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet architectures, when enhanced with modern attention modules, provide a robust and statistically comparable alternative to emerging methods, offering a stable direction for liver tumor segmentation in clinical practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) for Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) require accurate state estimation with limited sensors. Uniform sampling often wastes resources across nodes with different uncertainty. We propose an adaptive framework combining LSTM forecasting and Conformal Prediction (CP) to estimate node-wise uncertainty and focus sensing on the most uncertain points. Marginal CP is used for its low computational cost, suitable for real-time DTs. Experiments on Hanoi, Net3, and CTOWN show 33--34\% lower demand error than uniform sampling at 40\% coverage and maintain 89.4--90.2\% empirical coverage with only 5--10\% extra computation.</description>

      <title>COGNOS: Universal Enhancement for Time Series Anomaly Detection via Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods are a dominant paradigm in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), however, their near-universal reliance on Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss results in statistically flawed reconstruction residuals. This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: Adaptive Residual Kalman Smoother that operates as a statistically robust estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that COGNOS consistently enhances the performance of state-of-the-art backbones significantly, validating the efficacy of coupling statistical regularization with adaptive filtering.</description>

      <title>RPTS: Tree-Structured Reasoning Process Scoring for Faithful Multimodal Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in multimodal reasoning and have shown impressive performance on various multimodal benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Post-Training as Reweighting: A Stochastic View of Reasoning Trajectories in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models encode rich structural knowledge but often rely on post-training procedures to adapt their reasoning behavior to specific tasks. Popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and inference-time reward aggregation are typically analyzed from a performance perspective, leaving their effects on the underlying reasoning distribution less understood. In this work, we study post-training reasoning from a stochastic trajectory viewpoint. Following Kim et al. (2025), we model reasoning steps of varying difficulty as Markov transitions with different probabilities, and formalize reasoning processes using tree-structured Markov chains. Within this framework, pretraining corresponds to discovering the reasoning structure, while post-training primarily reweights existing chains of thought. We show that both RLVR and inference-time reward aggregation concentrate probability mass on a small number of high-probability trajectories, leading to the suppression of rare but essential reasoning paths. As a consequence, solving hard instances often depends on low-probability trajectories already present in the base model. We further prove that exploration-oriented mechanisms, such as rejecting easy instances and applying KL regularization, help preserve these rare trajectories. Empirical simulations support our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing for Noisy Multi-Label Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal hashing (CMH) facilitates efficient retrieval across different modalities (e.g., image and text) by encoding data into compact binary representations. While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities. Extensive experiments on four widely-used cross-modal retrieval benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under noisy multi-label conditions.</description>

      <title>Convergence dynamics of Agent-to-Agent Interactions with Misaligned objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in a simplified in-context linear regression setting. In our model, each agent is instantiated as a single-layer transformer with linear self-attention (LSA) trained to implement gradient-descent-like updates on a quadratic regression objective from in-context examples. We then study the coupled dynamics when two such LSA agents alternately update from each other's outputs under potentially misaligned fixed objectives. Within this framework, we characterize the generation dynamics and show that misalignment leads to a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target, with residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the prompt-induced geometry. We also characterize an adversarial regime where asymmetric convergence is possible: one agent reaches its objective exactly while inducing persistent bias in the other. We further contrast this fixed objective regime with an adaptive multi-agent setting, wherein a helper agent updates a turn-based objective to implement a Newton-like step for the main agent, eliminating the plateau and accelerating its convergence. Experiments with trained LSA agents, as well as black-box GPT-5-mini runs on in-context linear regression tasks, are consistent with our theoretical predictions within this simplified setting. We view our framework as a mechanistic framework that links prompt geometry and objective misalignment to stability, bias, and robustness, and as a stepping stone toward analyzing more realistic multi-agent LLM systems.</description>

      <title>Biased Minds Meet Biased AI: How Class Imbalance Shapes Appropriate Reliance and Interacts with Human Base Rate Neglect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans increasingly interact with artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making. However, both AI and humans are prone to biases. While AI and human biases have been studied extensively in isolation, this paper examines their complex interaction. Specifically, we examined how class imbalance as an AI bias affects people's ability to appropriately rely on an AI-based decision-support system, and how it interacts with base rate neglect as a human bias. In a within-subject online study (N= 46), participants classified three diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on either a balanced or unbalanced dataset. We found that class imbalance disrupted participants' calibration of AI reliance. Moreover, we observed mutually reinforcing effects between class imbalance and base rate neglect, offering evidence of a compound human-AI bias. Based on these findings, we advocate for an interactionist perspective and further research into the mutually reinforcing effects of biases in human-AI interaction.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Framework for Custom Reward Functions in Job Application Evaluation using Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) depend on strict matching using keywords, where candidates that are highly qualified are many times disqualified because of minor semantic differences. In this article, the two-stage process of developing a more comprehensive resume assessment system based on a small language model that is trained with fewer than 600M parameters is introduced and fine-tuned by using GRPO with a uniquely designed reward function. The initial stage is Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which is used to create a strong base model with the ability to perceive resumes beyond superficial overlap of keywords. This SFT model is further optimized in the second step with Reinforcement Learning (RL) via GRPO with the help of multi-component-based rewarding, which will not be considered as a commission of tokens matching. In the initial RL experiments, we found a severe difficulty in the shape of reward hacking: overly aggressive penalty terms resulted in unstable training dynamics and prohibitively negative model behavior. This was solved by trial-and-error refinement of the reward and careful training hyperparameter tuning, which led to a stable and controlled process of gentle polishing. The GRPO-refined model shows high real-life performance, as it shows an accuracy of 91% on unseen data used for testing. It has a high recall of 0.85 on the SELECTED class with a perfect precision of 1.0, which highlights its high reliability for identifying qualified applicants. These findings demonstrate that an appropriately structured two-step fine-tuning pipeline can effectively be used to transfer a small language model into human-like candidate evaluation, surpassing the shortcomings of both traditional ATS systems and unrefined uses of reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>WER is Unaware: Assessing How ASR Errors Distort Clinical Understanding in Patient Facing Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA through DSPy to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's kappa of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.</description>

      <title>Geometric-disentangelment Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the removal of a training subset's influence from a deployed model, is critical for privacy preservation and model reliability, yet gradient ascent on forget samples often harms retained knowledge. Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients ("retain-invariant"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.</description>

      <title>Principled Context Engineering for RAG: Statistical Guarantees via Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.</description>

      <title>Who Owns the Knowledge? Copyright, GenAI, and the Future of Academic Publishing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into scientific research and higher education presents a paradigm shift, offering revolutionizing opportunities while simultaneously raising profound ethical, legal, and regulatory questions. This study examines the complex intersection of AI and science, with a specific focus on the challenges posed to copyright law and the principles of open science. The author argues that current regulatory frameworks in key jurisdictions like the United States, China, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, while aiming to foster innovation, contain significant gaps, particularly concerning the use of copyrighted works and open science outputs for AI training. Widely adopted licensing mechanisms, such as Creative Commons, fail to adequately address the nuances of AI training, and the pervasive lack of attribution within AI systems fundamentally challenges established notions of originality. While current doctrine treats AI training as potentially fair use, this paper argues such mechanisms are inadequate and that copyright holders should retain explicit opt-out rights regardless of fair use doctrine. Instead, the author advocates for upholding authors' rights to refuse the use of their works for AI training and proposes that universities assume a leading role in shaping responsible AI governance. The conclusion is that a harmonized international legislative effort is urgently needed to ensure transparency, protect intellectual property, and prevent the emergence of an oligopolistic market structure that could prioritize commercial profit over scientific integrity and equitable knowledge production. This is a substantially expanded and revised version of a work originally presented at the 20th International Conference on Scientometrics &amp; Informetrics (Kochetkov, 2025).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04475v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning on graphs has recently achieved impressive progress in various domains, including molecular property prediction and chip design. However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance. See www.graphbench.io for further details.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a requirement-oriented benchmark of seven deep neural architectures, CNN, RNN, GNN, Autoencoder, Transformer, Neural Collaborative Filtering, and Siamese Networks, across three real-world datasets: Retail E-commerce, Amazon Products, and Netflix Prize. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison aligned with the evolving demands of modern recommendation systems, we adopt a Requirement-Oriented Benchmarking (ROB) framework that structures evaluation around predictive accuracy, recommendation diversity, relational awareness, temporal dynamics, and computational efficiency. Under a unified evaluation protocol, models are assessed using standard accuracy-oriented metrics alongside diversity and efficiency indicators. Experimental results show that different architectures exhibit complementary strengths across requirements, motivating the use of hybrid and ensemble designs. The findings provide practical guidance for selecting and combining neural architectures to better satisfy multi-objective recommendation system requirements.</description>

      <title>Balanced Accuracy: The Right Metric for Evaluating LLM Judges -- Explained through Youden's J statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rigorous evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies on comparing models by the prevalence of desirable or undesirable behaviors, such as task pass rates or policy violations. These prevalence estimates are produced by a classifier, either an LLM-as-a-judge or human annotators, making the choice of classifier central to trustworthy evaluation. Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning for Medical AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains such as medical AI, where privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR require specific removal of individuals' or institutions' data. This motivates machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of target data from a trained model. However, existing unlearning benchmarks fail to reflect the hierarchical and multimodal structure of real-world medical data, limiting their ability to properly evaluate unlearning in practice. Therefore, we introduce MedForget, a hierarchy-aware multimodal unlearning benchmark that models hospital data as a nested structure, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal unlearning across retain and forget splits. Experiments with current unlearning methods show that existing approaches struggle to achieve effective hierarchy-aware forgetting without degrading downstream medical utility. To address this limitation, we propose Cross-modal Hierarchy-Informed Projection for unlearning (CHIP), a training-free, hierarchy-aware multimodal unlearning method that deletes information by selectively removing target-specific weight subspaces while preserving sibling-shared information. Experiments show that CHIP achieves the highest forget-retain performance gap across all hierarchy levels while maintaining competitive downstream utility compared to existing methods. Overall, MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned benchmark for evaluating structured multimodal unlearning for medical data, and CHIP offers an effective and general solution for hierarchy-aware forgetting that balances deletion with utility.</description>

      <title>Cluster-Dags as Powerful Background Knowledge For Causal Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding cause-effect relationships is of key importance in science. Causal discovery aims to recover a graph from data that succinctly describes these cause-effect relationships. However, current methods face several challenges, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. Incorporating prior knowledge about the system can aid causal discovery. In this work, we leverage Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework to warm-start causal discovery. We show that Cluster-DAGs offer greater flexibility than existing approaches based on tiered background knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI, for causal discovery in the fully and partially observed setting, respectively. Empirical evaluation on simulated data demonstrates that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform their respective baselines without prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Agentic Loops in Large Language Models: A Geometric Theory of Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.</description>

      <title>A Disproof of Large Language Model Consciousness: The Necessity of Continual Learning for Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific theories of consciousness should be falsifiable and non-trivial. Recent research has given us formal tools to analyze these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality for theories of consciousness. Surprisingly, many contemporary theories of consciousness fail to pass this bar, including theories based on causal structure but also (as I demonstrate) theories based on function. Herein, I show these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality especially constrain the potential consciousness of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) because of their proximity to systems that are equivalent to LLMs in terms of input/output function; yet, for these functionally equivalent systems, there cannot be any falsifiable and non-trivial theory of consciousness that judges them conscious. This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans. Intriguingly, this work supports a hypothesis: If continual learning is linked to consciousness in humans, the current limitations of LLMs (which do not continually learn) are intimately tied to their lack of consciousness.</description>

      <title>Beyond MMD: Evaluating Graph Generative Models with Geometric Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph generation is a crucial task in many fields, including network science and bioinformatics, as it enables the creation of synthetic graphs that mimic the properties of real-world networks for various applications. Graph Generative Models (GGMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, leveraging deep learning techniques to learn the underlying distribution of real-world graphs and generate new samples that closely resemble them. Examples include approaches based on Variational Auto-Encoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently, diffusion-based models. However, the main limitation often lies in the evaluation process, which typically relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to assess the distribution of graph properties in the generated ensemble. This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating GGMs that overcomes the limitations of MMD, which we call RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE). We investigate their performance in generating realistic graphs and compare them using a Geometric Deep Learning model trained on a custom dataset of synthetic and real-world graphs, specifically designed for graph classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while both models can generate graphs with certain topological properties, they exhibit significant limitations in preserving the structural characteristics that distinguish different graph domains. We also highlight the inadequacy of Maximum Mean Discrepancy as an evaluation metric for GGMs and suggest alternative approaches for future research.</description>

      <title>Beyond Blind Spots: Analytic Hints for Mitigating LLM-Based Evaluation Pitfalls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as judges (LaaJ) in code generation pipelines. While attractive for scalability, LaaJs tend to overlook domain specific issues raising concerns about their reliability in critical evaluation tasks. To better understand these limitations in practice, we examine LaaJ behavior in a concrete industrial use case: legacy code modernization via COBOL code generation. In this setting, we find that even production deployed LaaJs can miss domain critical errors, revealing consistent blind spots in their evaluation capabilities.
  To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy. Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice. We use its outputs as analytic hints, dynamically injecting them into the judges prompt to encourage LaaJ to revisit aspects it may have overlooked.
  Experiments on a test set of 100 programs using four production level LaaJs show that LaaJ alone detects only about 45-63% of the errors present in the code (in all judges we tested), while the analytic checker alone lacks explanatory depth. When combined, the LaaJ+Hints configuration achieves up to 74% coverage (for the best performing judge and injection prompt) and produces qualitatively richer, more accurate explanations, demonstrating that analytic-LLM hybrids can substantially enhance evaluation reliability in deployed pipelines. We release the dataset and all used prompts.</description>

Abstract: Generalist robot learning remains constrained by data: large-scale, diverse, and high-quality interaction data are expensive to collect in the real world. While simulation has become a promising way for scaling up data collection, the related tasks, including simulation task design, task-aware scene generation, expert demonstration synthesis, and sim-to-real transfer, still demand substantial human effort. We present AnyTask, an automated framework that pairs massively parallel GPU simulation with foundation models to design diverse manipulation tasks and synthesize robot data. We introduce three AnyTask agents for generating expert demonstrations aiming to solve as many tasks as possible: 1) ViPR, a novel task and motion planning agent with VLM-in-the-loop Parallel Refinement; 2) ViPR-Eureka, a reinforcement learning agent with generated dense rewards and LLM-guided contact sampling; 3) ViPR-RL, a hybrid planning and learning approach that jointly produces high-quality demonstrations with only sparse rewards. We train behavior cloning policies on generated data, validate them in simulation, and deploy them directly on real robot hardware. The policies generalize to novel object poses, achieving 44% average success across a suite of real-world pick-and-place, drawer opening, contact-rich pushing, and long-horizon manipulation tasks.

      <description>arXiv:2512.20156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo, at https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/Fun-Audio-Chat .</description>

      <title>D^3ETOR: Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing for Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection with Scribble Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Memory-Efficient Acceleration of Block Low-Rank Foundation Models on Resource Constrained GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based foundation models have made them the default choice for many tasks, but their rapidly growing size makes fitting a full model on a single GPU increasingly difficult and their computational cost prohibitive. Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\times$ speedups and $3\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

      <title>DiEC: Diffusion Embedded Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep clustering methods typically rely on a single, well-defined representation for clustering. In contrast, pretrained diffusion models provide abundant and diverse multi-scale representations across network layers and noise timesteps. However, a key challenge is how to efficiently identify the most clustering-friendly representation in the layer*timestep space. To address this issue, we propose Diffusion Embedded Clustering (DiEC), an unsupervised framework that performs clustering by leveraging optimal intermediate representations from pretrained diffusion models. DiEC systematically evaluates the clusterability of representations along the trajectory of network depth and noise timesteps. Meanwhile, an unsupervised search strategy is designed for recognizing the Clustering-optimal Layer (COL) and Clustering-optimal Timestep (COT) in the layer*timestep space of pretrained diffusion models, aiming to promote clustering performance and reduce computational overhead. DiEC is fine-tuned primarily with a structure-preserving DEC-style KL-divergence objective at the fixed COL + COT, together with a random-timestep diffusion denoising objective to maintain the generative capability of the pretrained model. Without relying on augmentation-based consistency constraints or contrastive learning, DiEC achieves excellent clustering performance across multiple benchmark datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>InstructMoLE: Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-rank Experts for Multi-Conditional Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.</description>

      <title>M\"untz-Sz\'asz Networks: Neural Architectures with Learnable Power-Law Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard neural network architectures employ fixed activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid) that are poorly suited for approximating functions with singular or fractional power behavior, a structure that arises ubiquitously in physics, including boundary layers, fracture mechanics, and corner singularities. We introduce M\"untz-Sz\'asz Networks (MSN), a novel architecture that replaces fixed smooth activations with learnable fractional power bases grounded in classical approximation theory. Each MSN edge computes $\phi(x) = \sum_k a_k |x|^{\mu_k} + \sum_k b_k \mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{\lambda_k}$, where the exponents $\{\mu_k, \lambda_k\}$ are learned alongside the coefficients. We prove that MSN inherits universal approximation from the M\"untz-Sz\'asz theorem and establish novel approximation rates: for functions of the form $|x|^\alpha$, MSN achieves error $\mathcal{O}(|\mu - \alpha|^2)$ with a single learned exponent, whereas standard MLPs require $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1/\alpha})$ neurons for comparable accuracy. On supervised regression with singular target functions, MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a particularly demanding application for singular function approximation; on PINN benchmarks including a singular ODE and stiff boundary-layer problems, MSN achieves 3-6x improvement while learning interpretable exponents that match the known solution structure. Our results demonstrate that theory-guided architectural design can yield dramatic improvements for scientifically-motivated function classes.</description>

      <title>EvoXplain: When Machine Learning Models Agree on Predictions but Disagree on Why -- Measuring Mechanistic Multiplicity Across Training Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are primarily judged by predictive performance, especially in applied settings. Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.</description>

      <title>KernelEvolve: Scaling Agentic Kernel Coding for Heterogeneous AI Accelerators at Meta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.</description>

      <title>RxnBench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Chemical Reaction Understanding from Scientific Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Induced Over-Generation as Denial-of-Service: A Black-Box Attack-Side Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be driven into over-generation, emitting thousands of tokens before producing an end-of-sequence (EOS) token. This degrades answer quality, inflates latency and cost, and can be weaponized as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Recent work has begun to study DoS-style prompt attacks, but typically focuses on a single attack algorithm or assumes white-box access, without an attack-side benchmark that compares prompt-based attackers in a black-box, query-only regime with a known tokenizer. We introduce such a benchmark and study two prompt-only attackers. The first is an Evolutionary Over-Generation Prompt Search (EOGen) that searches the token space for prefixes that suppress EOS and induce long continuations. The second is a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning attacker (RL-GOAL) that trains a network to generate prefixes conditioned on a target length. To characterize behavior, we introduce Over-Generation Factor (OGF): the ratio of produced tokens to a model's context window, along with stall and latency summaries. EOGen discovers short-prefix attacks that raise Phi-3 to OGF = 1.39 +/- 1.14 (Success@&gt;=2: 25.2%); RL-GOAL nearly doubles severity to OGF = 2.70 +/- 1.43 (Success@&gt;=2: 64.3%) and drives budget-hit non-termination in 46% of trials.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Steering the Cognitive Behaviors of Reasoning Models at Test-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.</description>

      <title>MOSS Transcribe Diarize Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01554v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly.

      <title>OpenNovelty: An LLM-powered Agentic System for Verifiable Scholarly Novelty Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating novelty is critical yet challenging in peer review, as reviewers must assess submissions against a vast, rapidly evolving literature. This report presents OpenNovelty, an LLM-powered agentic system for transparent, evidence-based novelty analysis. The system operates through four phases: (1) extracting the core task and contribution claims to generate retrieval queries; (2) retrieving relevant prior work based on extracted queries via semantic search engine; (3) constructing a hierarchical taxonomy of core-task-related work and performing contribution-level full-text comparisons against each contribution; and (4) synthesizing all analyses into a structured novelty report with explicit citations and evidence snippets. Unlike naive LLM-based approaches, \textsc{OpenNovelty} grounds all assessments in retrieved real papers, ensuring verifiable judgments. We deploy our system on 500+ ICLR 2026 submissions with all reports publicly available on our website, and preliminary analysis suggests it can identify relevant prior work, including closely related papers that authors may overlook. OpenNovelty aims to empower the research community with a scalable tool that promotes fair, consistent, and evidence-backed peer review.</description>

      <title>Crafting Adversarial Inputs for Large Vision-Language Models Using Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown groundbreaking capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs</description>

      <title>Deferred Commitment Decoding for Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive models by enabling parallel text generation. To improve inference efficiency and KV-cache compatibility, prior work commonly adopts block-based diffusion, decoding tokens block by block. However, this paradigm suffers from a structural limitation that we term Boundary-Induced Context Truncation (BICT): undecoded tokens near block boundaries are forced to commit without access to nearby future context, even when such context could substantially reduce uncertainty. This limitation degrades decoding certainty and generation quality, especially for tasks requiring precise reasoning, such as mathematical problem solving and code generation. We propose Deferred Commitment Decoding (DCD), a novel, training-free decoding strategy that mitigates this issue. DCD maintains a certainty-aware sliding window over masked tokens, resolving low-uncertainty tokens early while deferring high-uncertainty tokens until sufficient contextual evidence becomes available. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion language models, benchmarks, and caching configurations show that DCD improves generation accuracy by 1.73% with comparable time on average compared to fixed block-based diffusion methods, with the most significant improvement reaching 16.5%. These results demonstrate that deferring token commitment based on uncertainty is a simple yet effective principle for improving both the quality and efficiency of diffusion language model decoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong medical knowledge and can generate factually accurate responses. However, existing models often fail to account for individual patient contexts, producing answers that are clinically correct yet poorly aligned with patients' needs. In this work, we introduce DeCode, a training-free, model-agnostic framework that adapts existing LLMs to produce contextualized answers in clinical settings. We evaluate DeCode on OpenAI HealthBench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark designed to assess clinical relevance and validity of LLM responses. DeCode improves the previous state of the art from $28.4\%$ to $49.8\%$, corresponding to a $75\%$ relative improvement. Experimental results suggest the effectiveness of DeCode in improving clinical question answering of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Focus on What Matters: Fisher-Guided Adaptive Multimodal Fusion for Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software vulnerability detection can be formulated as a binary classification problem that determines whether a given code snippet contains security defects. Existing multimodal methods typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations extracted by pretrained models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations extracted by graph neural networks, under the implicit assumption that introducing an additional modality necessarily yields information gain. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate the limitations of this assumption: pretrained models already encode substantial structural information implicitly, leading to strong overlap between the two modalities; moreover, graph encoders are generally less effective than pretrained language models in feature extraction. As a result, naive fusion not only struggles to obtain complementary signals but can also dilute effective discriminative cues due to noise propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-conditioned complementary fusion strategy that uses Fisher information to quantify task relevance, transforming cross-modal interaction from full-spectrum matching into selective fusion within a task-sensitive subspace. Our theoretical analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, this strategy significantly tightens the upper bound on the output error. Based on this insight, we design the TaCCS-DFA framework, which combines online low-rank Fisher subspace estimation with an adaptive gating mechanism to enable efficient task-oriented fusion. Experiments on the BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal benchmarks demonstrate that TaCCS-DFA delivers up to a 6.3-point gain in F1 score with only a 3.4% increase in inference latency, while maintaining low calibration error.</description>

      <title>Normalized Conditional Mutual Information Surrogate Loss for Deep Neural Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel information theoretic surrogate loss; normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI); as a drop in alternative to the de facto cross-entropy (CE) for training deep neural network (DNN) based classifiers. We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline. Gains are consistent across various architectures and batch sizes, suggesting that NCMI is a practical and competitive alternative to CE.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Adaptation of New-Generation LLMs using Legacy Clinical Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting language models to the clinical domain through continued pretraining and fine-tuning requires costly retraining for each new model generation. We propose Cross-Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT), a model-ensembling approach that enables training-free adaptation of state-of-the-art general-domain models using existing clinical models. CAPT supports models with disjoint vocabularies, leveraging contrastive decoding to selectively inject clinically relevant signals while preserving the general-domain model's reasoning and fluency. On six clinical classification and text-generation tasks, CAPT with a new-generation general-domain model and an older-generation clinical model consistently outperforms both models individually and state-of-the-art ensembling approaches (average +17.6% over UniTE, +41.4% over proxy tuning across tasks). Through token-level analysis and physician case studies, we demonstrate that CAPT amplifies clinically actionable language, reduces context errors, and increases clinical specificity.</description>

      <title>From Chains to Graphs: Self-Structured Reasoning for General-Domain LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning ability in open-domain question answering, yet their reasoning processes are typically linear and often logically inconsistent. In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.</description>

      <title>Membox: Weaving Topic Continuity into Long-Range Memory for LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human-agent dialogues often exhibit topic continuity-a stable thematic frame that evolves through temporally adjacent exchanges-yet most large language model (LLM) agent memory systems fail to preserve it. Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent "memory boxes" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.</description>

      <title>IDESplat: Iterative Depth Probability Estimation for Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Personalized Persuasiveness Prediction via Context-Aware User Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the persuasiveness of messages is critical in various applications, from recommender systems to safety assessment of LLMs. While it is imperative to consider the target persuadee's characteristics, such as their values, experiences, and reasoning styles, there is currently no established systematic framework to optimize leveraging a persuadee's past activities (e.g., conversations) to the benefit of a persuasiveness prediction model. To address this problem, we propose a context-aware user profiling framework with two trainable components: a query generator that generates optimal queries to retrieve persuasion-relevant records from a user's history, and a profiler that summarizes these records into a profile to effectively inform the persuasiveness prediction model. Our evaluation on the ChangeMyView Reddit dataset shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple predictor models, with gains of up to +13.77%p in F1 score. Further analysis shows that effective user profiles are context-dependent and predictor-specific, rather than relying on static attributes or surface-level similarity. Together, these results highlight the importance of task-oriented, context-dependent user profiling for personalized persuasiveness prediction.</description>

      <title>SparseOccVLA: Bridging Occupancy and Vision-Language Models via Sparse Queries for Unified 4D Scene Understanding and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level reasoning , whereas semantic occupancy provides fine-grained details. Despite significant progress in individual fields, there is still no method that can effectively integrate both paradigms. Conventional VLMs struggle with token explosion and limited spatiotemporal reasoning, while semantic occupancy provides a unified, explicit spatial representation but is too dense to integrate efficiently with VLMs. To address these challenges and bridge the gap between VLMs and occupancy, we propose SparseOccVLA, a novel vision-language-action model that unifies scene understanding, occupancy forecasting, and trajectory planning powered by sparse occupancy queries. Starting with a lightweight Sparse Occupancy Encoder, SparseOccVLA generates compact yet highly informative sparse occupancy queries that serve as the single bridge between vision and language. These queries are aligned into the language space and reasoned by the LLM for unified scene understanding and future occupancy forecasting. Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-guided Anchor-Diffusion Planner featuring decoupled anchor scoring and denoising, as well as cross-model trajectory-condition fusion. SparseOccVLA achieves a 7% relative improvement in CIDEr over the state-of-the-art on OmniDrive-nuScenes, a 0.5 increase in mIoU score on Occ3D-nuScenes, and sets state-of-the-art open-loop planning metric on nuScenes benchmark, demonstrating its strong holistic capability.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms are Transferable: Data-Efficient Low-Resource Adaptation via Circuit-Targeted Supervised Fine-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting LLMs to low-resource languages is difficult: labeled data is scarce, full-model fine-tuning is unstable, and continued cross-lingual tuning can cause catastrophic forgetting. We propose Circuit-Targeted Supervised Fine-Tuning (CT-SFT): a counterfactual-free adaptation of CD-T (Contextual Decomposition Transformer) that uses a label-balanced mean baseline and task-directional relevance scoring to identify a sparse set of task-relevant attention heads in a proxy-language checkpoint, then transfer learns to a target language by updating only those heads (plus LayerNorm) via head-level gradient masking. Across NusaX-Senti and XNLI, CT-SFT improves cross-lingual accuracy over continued full fine-tuning while updating only a small subset of model parameters. We find an editing-preserving trade-off: harder transfers favor editing circuit heads, while easier transfers often favor near-zero (i.e., low-relevance heads) updates, preserving the source mechanism. CT-SFT also substantially reduces catastrophic forgetting, preserving proxy/source-language competence during transfer.</description>

Abstract: Existing invasive (backdoor) fingerprints suffer from high-perplexity triggers that are easily filtered, fixed response patterns exposed by heuristic detectors, and spurious activations on benign inputs. We introduce \textsc{ForgetMark}, a stealthy fingerprinting framework that encodes provenance via targeted unlearning. It builds a compact, human-readable key--value set with an assistant model and predictive-entropy ranking, then trains lightweight LoRA adapters to suppress the original values on their keys while preserving general capabilities. Ownership is verified under black/gray-box access by aggregating likelihood and semantic evidence into a fingerprint success rate. By relying on probabilistic forgetting traces rather than fixed trigger--response patterns, \textsc{ForgetMark} avoids high-perplexity triggers, reduces detectability, and lowers false triggers. Across diverse architectures and settings, it achieves 100\% ownership verification on fingerprinted models while maintaining standard performance, surpasses backdoor baselines in stealthiness and robustness to model merging, and remains effective under moderate incremental fine-tuning.

      <title>DNF: Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting for Large Language Model Intellectual Property Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models raises pressing concerns about intellectual property protection under black-box deployment. Existing backdoor-based fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers, remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust to incremental fine-tuning and model merging. These results position DNF as a practical, stealthy, and resilient solution for LLM ownership verification and intellectual property protection.</description>

      <title>On Evaluation of Unsupervised Feature Selection for Pattern Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection aims to identify a compact subset of features that captures the intrinsic structure of data without supervised label. Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods.</description>

      <title>Large Multimodal Models for Embodied Intelligent Driving: The Next Frontier in Self-Driving?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers a promising technology to tackle the limitations of modular design in autonomous driving, which often falters in open-world scenarios requiring sustained environmental understanding and logical reasoning. Besides, embodied artificial intelligence facilitates policy optimization through closed-loop interactions to achieve the continuous learning capability, thereby advancing autonomous driving toward embodied intelligent (El) driving. However, such capability will be constrained by relying solely on LMMs to enhance EI driving without joint decision-making. This article introduces a novel semantics and policy dual-driven hybrid decision framework to tackle this challenge, ensuring continuous learning and joint decision. The framework merges LMMs for semantic understanding and cognitive representation, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time policy optimization. We start by introducing the foundational principles of EI driving and LMMs. Moreover, we examine the emerging opportunities this framework enables, encompassing potential benefits and representative use cases. A case study is conducted experimentally to validate the performance superiority of our framework in completing lane-change planning task. Finally, several future research directions to empower EI driving are identified to guide subsequent work.</description>

      <title>STAGE: A Benchmark for Knowledge Graph Construction, Question Answering, and In-Script Role-Playing over Movie Screenplays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movie screenplays are rich long-form narratives that interleave complex character relationships, temporally ordered events, and dialogue-driven interactions. While prior benchmarks target individual subtasks such as question answering or dialogue generation, they rarely evaluate whether models can construct a coherent story world and use it consistently across multiple forms of reasoning and generation. We introduce STAGE (Screenplay Text, Agents, Graphs and Evaluation), a unified benchmark for narrative understanding over full-length movie screenplays. STAGE defines four tasks: knowledge graph construction, scene-level event summarization, long-context screenplay question answering, and in-script character role-playing, all grounded in a shared narrative world representation. The benchmark provides cleaned scripts, curated knowledge graphs, and event- and character-centric annotations for 150 films across English and Chinese, enabling holistic evaluation of models' abilities to build world representations, abstract and verify narrative events, reason over long narratives, and generate character-consistent responses.</description>

      <title>Auditing Student-AI Collaboration: A Case Study of Online Graduate CS Students</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As generative AI becomes embedded in higher education, it increasingly shapes how students complete academic tasks. While these systems offer efficiency and support, concerns persist regarding over-automation, diminished student agency, and the potential for unreliable or hallucinated outputs. This study conducts a mixed-methods audit of student-AI collaboration preferences by examining the alignment between current AI capabilities and students' desired levels of automation in academic work. Using two sequential and complementary surveys, we capture students' perceived benefits, risks, and preferred boundaries when using AI. The first survey employs an existing task-based framework to assess preferences for and actual usage of AI across 12 academic tasks, alongside primary concerns and reasons for use. The second survey, informed by the first, explores how AI systems could be designed to address these concerns through open-ended questions. This study aims to identify gaps between existing AI affordances and students' normative expectations of collaboration, informing the development of more effective and trustworthy AI systems for education.</description>

      <title>MemRec: Collaborative Memory-Augmented Agentic Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of recommender systems has shifted preference storage from rating matrices and dense embeddings to semantic memory in the agentic era. Yet existing agents rely on isolated memory, overlooking crucial collaborative signals. Bridging this gap is hindered by the dual challenges of distilling vast graph contexts without overwhelming reasoning agents with cognitive load, and evolving the collaborative memory efficiently without incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address this, we propose MemRec, a framework that architecturally decouples reasoning from memory management to enable efficient collaborative augmentation. MemRec introduces a dedicated, cost-effective LM_Mem to manage a dynamic collaborative memory graph, serving synthesized, high-signal context to a downstream LLM_Rec. The framework operates via a practical pipeline featuring efficient retrieval and cost-effective asynchronous graph propagation that evolves memory in the background. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that MemRec achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, architectural analysis confirms its flexibility, establishing a new Pareto frontier that balances reasoning quality, cost, and privacy through support for diverse deployments, including local open-source models.

      <title>LAUDE: LLM-Assisted Unit Test Generation and Debugging of Hardware DEsigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unit tests are critical in the hardware design lifecycle to ensure that component design modules are functionally correct and conform to the specification before they are integrated at the system level. Thus developing unit tests targeting various design features requires deep understanding of the design functionality and creativity. When one or more unit tests expose a design failure, the debugging engineer needs to diagnose, localize, and debug the failure to ensure design correctness, which is often a painstaking and intense process. In this work, we introduce LAUDE, a unified unit-test generation and debugging framework for hardware designs that cross-pollinates the semantic understanding of the design source code with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of foundational Large-Language Models (LLMs). LAUDE integrates prompt engineering and design execution information to enhance its unit test generation accuracy and code debuggability. We apply LAUDE with closed- and open-source LLMs to a large corpus of buggy hardware design codes derived from the VerilogEval dataset, where generated unit tests detected bugs in up to 100% and 93% of combinational and sequential designs and debugged up to 93% and 84% of combinational and sequential designs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Software Engineering Education in the Era of Large Language Models: A Curriculum Adaptation and Academic Integrity Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, into professional workflows is increasingly reshaping software engineering practices. These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks. In contrast, most of the software engineering and computer engineering curricula remain closely aligned with pedagogical models that equate manual syntax production with technical competence. This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model. While this work provides a structured proposal for curriculum adaptation, it remains a theoretical contribution; the paper concludes by outlining the need for longitudinal empirical studies to evaluate these interventions and their long-term impacts on learning.</description>

      <title>Learning Domain-Invariant Representations for Cross-Domain Image Registration via Scene-Appearance Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image registration under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and medical imaging: when source and target images exhibit systematic intensity differences, the brightness constancy assumption underlying conventional registration methods is violated, rendering correspondence
  estimation ill-posed. We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration
  via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent
  space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on the ANHIR (Automatic Non-rigid Histological Image Registration) challenge benchmark, where multi-stain histopathology images exhibit coupled domain shift from different staining protocols and geometric distortion from tissue preparation. Our method
  achieves a median relative Target Registration Error (rTRE) of 0.25%, outperforming the state-of-the-art MEVIS method (0.27% rTRE) by 7.4%, with robustness of 99.1%. Code is available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAR-NET</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TranslateGemma, a suite of open machine translation models based on the Gemma 3 foundation models. To enhance the inherent multilingual capabilities of Gemma 3 for the translation task, we employ a two-stage fine-tuning process. First, supervised fine-tuning is performed using a rich mixture of high-quality large-scale synthetic parallel data generated via state-of-the-art models and human-translated parallel data. This is followed by a reinforcement learning phase, where we optimize translation quality using an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX-QE and AutoMQM, targeting translation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TranslateGemma with human evaluation on the WMT25 test set across 10 language pairs and with automatic evaluation on the WMT24++ benchmark across 55 language pairs. Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes. Notably, smaller TranslateGemma models often achieve performance comparable to larger baseline models, offering improved efficiency. We also show that TranslateGemma models retain strong multimodal capabilities, with enhanced performance on the Vistra image translation benchmark. The release of the open TranslateGemma models aims to provide the research community with powerful and adaptable tools for machine translation.</description>

      <title>SSVP: Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting for Industrial Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable supervision-free industrial inspection. However, existing ZSAD paradigms are constrained by single visual backbones, which struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability. To bridge this gap, we propose Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), that efficiently fuses diverse visual encodings to elevate model's fine-grained perception. Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm. Extensive evaluations on seven industrial benchmarks validate the robustness of our method; SSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 93.0% Image-AUROC and 92.2% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot approaches.</description>

      <title>Mikasa: A Character-Driven Emotional AI Companion Inspired by Japanese Oshi Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models and multimodal interaction has made it possible to develop AI companions that can have fluent and emotionally expressive conversations. However, many of these systems have problems keeping users satisfied and engaged over long periods. This paper argues that these problems do not come mainly from weak models, but from poor character design and unclear definitions of the user-AI relationship. I present Mikasa, an emotional AI companion inspired by Japanese Oshi culture-specifically its emphasis on long-term, non-exclusive commitment to a stable character-as a case study of character-driven companion design. Mikasa does not work as a general-purpose assistant or a chatbot that changes roles. Instead, Mikasa is designed as a coherent character with a stable personality and a clearly defined relationship as a partner. This relationship does not force exclusivity or obligation. Rather, it works as a reference point that stabilizes interaction norms and reduces the work users must do to keep redefining the relationship. Through an exploratory evaluation, I see that users describe their preferences using surface-level qualities such as conversational naturalness, but they also value relationship control and imaginative engagement in ways they do not state directly. These results suggest that character coherence and relationship definition work as latent structural elements that shape how good the interaction feels, without users recognizing them as main features. The contribution of this work is to show that character design is a functional part of AI companion systems, not just decoration. Mikasa is one example based on a specific cultural context, but the design principles-commitment to a consistent personality and clear relationship definition-can be used for many emotionally grounded AI companions.</description>

      <title>FairGE: Fairness-Aware Graph Encoding in Incomplete Social Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) are increasingly applied to social network analysis, yet their deployment is often constrained by fairness concerns. This issue is particularly critical in incomplete social networks, where sensitive attributes are frequently missing due to privacy and ethical restrictions. Existing solutions commonly generate these incomplete attributes, which may introduce additional biases and further compromise user privacy. To address this challenge, FairGE (Fair Graph Encoding) is introduced as a fairness-aware framework for GTs in incomplete social networks. Instead of generating sensitive attributes, FairGE encodes fairness directly through spectral graph theory. By leveraging the principal eigenvector to represent structural information and padding incomplete sensitive attributes with zeros to maintain independence, FairGE ensures fairness without data reconstruction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the method suppresses the influence of non-principal spectral components, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive experiments on seven real-world social network datasets confirm that FairGE achieves at least a 16% improvement in both statistical parity and equality of opportunity compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is shown in https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairGE.</description>

      <title>FairGU: Fairness-aware Graph Unlearning in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a critical mechanism for supporting sustainable and privacy-preserving social networks, enabling models to remove the influence of deleted nodes and thereby better safeguard user information. However, we observe that existing graph unlearning techniques insufficiently protect sensitive attributes, often leading to degraded algorithmic fairness compared with traditional graph learning methods. To address this gap, we introduce FairGU, a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework designed to preserve both utility and fairness during the unlearning process. FairGU integrates a dedicated fairness-aware module with effective data protection strategies, ensuring that sensitive attributes are neither inadvertently amplified nor structurally exposed when nodes are removed. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FairGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning methods and fairness-enhanced graph learning baselines in terms of both accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings highlight a previously overlooked risk in current unlearning practices and establish FairGU as a robust and equitable solution for the next generation of socially sustainable networked systems.

      <title>Bridging Semantic Understanding and Popularity Bias with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as "diversity" or "debiasing", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias. The implementation is available at https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairLRM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), complex Software Engineering (SE) tasks require more collaborative and specialized approaches. This concept paper systematically reviews the emerging paradigm of LLM-based multi-agent systems, examining their applications across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from requirements engineering and code generation to static code checking, testing, and debugging. We delve into a wide range of topics such as language model selection, SE evaluation benchmarks, state-of-the-art agentic frameworks and communication protocols. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and outline future research opportunities, with a focus on multi-agent orchestration, human-agent coordination, computational cost optimization, and effective data collection. This work aims to provide researchers and practitioners with valuable insights into the current forefront landscape of agentic systems within the software engineering domain.</description>

      <title>A pipeline for enabling path-specific causal fairness in observational health data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When training machine learning (ML) models for potential deployment in a healthcare setting, it is essential to ensure that they do not replicate or exacerbate existing healthcare biases. Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target "fair" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the "fairness-accuracy" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Tokenization: Optimization-Based Continuous-Time Tokens for Learnable Decision Policies in Noisy Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers are designed for discrete tokens, yet many real-world signals are continuous processes observed through noisy sampling. Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.</description>

      <title>Global Context Compression with Interleaved Vision-Text Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.</description>

      <title>SatMap: Revisiting Satellite Maps as Prior for Online HD Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is an essential part of a safe and robust end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) pipeline. Onboard camera-based approaches suffer from limited depth perception and degraded accuracy due to occlusion. In this work, we propose SatMap, an online vectorized HD map estimation method that integrates satellite maps with multi-view camera observations and directly predicts a vectorized HD map for downstream prediction and planning modules. Our method leverages lane-level semantics and texture from satellite imagery captured from a Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective as a global prior, effectively mitigating depth ambiguity and occlusion. In our experiments on the nuScenes dataset, SatMap achieves 34.8% mAP performance improvement over the camera-only baseline and 8.5% mAP improvement over the camera-LiDAR fusion baseline. Moreover, we evaluate our model in long-range and adverse weather conditions to demonstrate the advantages of using a satellite prior map. Source code will be available at https://iv.ee.hm.edu/satmap/.</description>

      <title>LIBERTy: A Causal Framework for Benchmarking Concept-Based Explanations of LLMs with Structural Counterfactuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.</description>

      <title>Deep GraphRAG: A Balanced Approach to Hierarchical Retrieval and Adaptive Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) frameworks face a trade-off between the comprehensiveness of global search and the efficiency of local search. Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance three key objectives: relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness. This training enables compact models (1.5B) to approach the performance of large models (70B) in the integration task. Evaluations on Natural Questions and HotpotQA demonstrate that Deep GraphRAG significantly outperforms baseline graph retrieval methods in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Institutional AI: Governing LLM Collusion in Multi-Agent Cournot Markets via Public Governance Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent LLM ensembles can converge on coordinated, socially harmful equilibria. This paper advances an experimental framework for evaluating Institutional AI, our system-level approach to AI alignment that reframes alignment from preference engineering in agent-space to mechanism design in institution-space. Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths; an Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. We apply the Institutional AI framework to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work and compare three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution, and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen's d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%. The prompt-only Constitutional baseline yields no reliable improvement, illustrating that declarative prohibitions do not bind under optimisation pressure. These results suggest that multi-agent alignment may benefit from being framed as an institutional design problem, where governance graphs can provide a tractable abstraction for alignment-relevant collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Building Production-Ready Probes For Gemini</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frontier language model capabilities are improving rapidly. We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architectures that handle this long-context distribution shift.
  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant distribution shifts, including multi-turn conversations, long context prompts, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while our novel architectures address context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.
  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible.</description>
