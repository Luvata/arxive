      <title>Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D): Exploring Causal Loop Diagram Leverage Points under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are widely used in health and environmental research to represent hypothesized causal structures underlying complex problems. However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited in their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention strategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network centrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose Diagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory system dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal user input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks, flows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information already encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate hypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under uncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and low-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed from the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with the data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing uncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is implemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to support further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for researchers working with CLDs. We expect additional validation will further establish the approach's utility across a broad range of cases and domains.</description>

      <title>A Graph Neural Network Approach for Mapping the Conceptual Structure and Inter-Branch Connectivity of Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for representing and analyzing physical laws as a weighted knowledge graph. We constructed a database of 659 distinct physical equations, subjected to rigorous semantic cleaning to resolve notational ambiguities, resulting in a corpus of 400 advanced physics equations. We developed an enhanced graph representation where both physical concepts and equations are nodes, connected by weighted inter-equation bridges. These weights are objectively defined using normalized metrics for variable overlap, physics-informed importance scores, and bibliometric data. A Graph Attention Network (GAT) was trained for link prediction, achieving a test AUC of 0.9742 +/- 0.0018 across five independent runs, significantly outperforming both classical heuristics (best baseline AUC: 0.9487) and established GNN architectures like GraphSAGE (AUC: 0.9504, p = 0.029). Statistical testing confirmed significance of all comparisons (p &lt; 0.05), with 2.7% improvement over the best baseline. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) The model autonomously rediscovers the known macroscopic structure of physics, identifying strong conceptual axes between Electromagnetism and Statistical Mechanics. (ii) It identifies central hub equations that serve as critical bridges between multiple physical domains. (iii) The model generates stable, computationally-derived hypotheses for cross-domain relationships, identifying both known principles and suggesting novel mathematical analogies for further theoretical investigation. The framework can generate hundreds of such hypotheses, enabling the creation of specialized datasets for targeted analysis of specific physics subfields.

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Nonlinear Nudging for Chaotic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nudging is an empirical data assimilation technique that incorporates an observation-driven control term into the model dynamics. The trajectory of the nudged system approaches the true system trajectory over time, even when the initial conditions differ. For linear state space models, such control terms can be derived under mild assumptions. However, designing effective nudging terms becomes significantly more challenging in the nonlinear setting. In this work, we propose neural network nudging, a data-driven method for learning nudging terms in nonlinear state space models. We establish a theoretical existence result based on the Kazantzis--Kravaris--Luenberger observer theory. The proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark problems that exhibit chaotic behavior: the Lorenz 96 model, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and the Kolmogorov flow.</description>

      <title>From Imperfect Signals to Trustworthy Structure: Confidence-Aware Inference from Heterogeneous and Reliability-Varying Utility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate distribution grid topology is essential for reliable modern grid operations. However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources with varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in collaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework that reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating heterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally governed by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical infrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the system in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly leveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent reconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data quality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware inference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect inputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for operator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled with hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational constraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology requirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components ensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid, enabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under real-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using data from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory, demonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and substantial improvements in confidence calibration and computational efficiency relative to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Linear Baseline Models for Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across scientific domains, a fundamental challenge is to characterize and compute the mappings from underlying physical processes to observed signals and measurements. While nonlinear neural networks have achieved considerable success, they remain theoretically opaque, which hinders adoption in contexts where interpretability is paramount. In contrast, linear neural networks serve as a simple yet effective foundation for gaining insight into these complex relationships. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework for analyzing linear encoder-decoder architectures through the lens of Bayes risk minimization for solving data-driven scientific machine learning problems. We derive closed-form, rank-constrained linear and affine linear optimal mappings for forward modeling and inverse recovery tasks. Our results generalize existing formulations by accommodating rank-deficiencies in data, forward operators, and measurement processes. We validate our theoretical results by conducting numerical experiments on datasets from simple biomedical imaging, financial factor analysis, and simulations involving nonlinear fluid dynamics via the shallow water equations. This work provides a robust baseline for understanding and benchmarking learned neural network models for scientific machine learning problems.</description>

      <title>An Effective Approach for Node Classification in Textual Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textual Attribute Graphs (TAGs) are critical for modeling complex networks like citation networks, but effective node classification remains challenging due to difficulties in integrating rich semantics from text with structural graph information. Existing methods often struggle with capturing nuanced domain-specific terminology, modeling long-range dependencies, adapting to temporal evolution, and scaling to massive datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph Representation Enhancement) with Graphormer. Our approach leverages a large language model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, within the TAPE framework to generate semantically rich explanations from paper content, which are then fused into enhanced node representations. These embeddings are combined with structural features using a novel integration layer with learned attention weights. Graphormer's path-aware position encoding and multi-head attention mechanisms are employed to effectively capture long-range dependencies across the citation network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the challenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a classification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN baseline of 0.713. Our method also yields strong results in precision (0.671), recall (0.577), and F1-score (0.610). We validate our approach through comprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating the synergy between semantic and structural information. Our framework provides a scalable and robust solution for node classification in dynamic TAGs, offering a promising direction for future research in knowledge systems and scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>A Markov Decision Process Framework for Early Maneuver Decisions in Satellite Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a Markov decision process (MDP) framework to model decision-making for collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) and a reinforcement learning policy gradient (RL-PG) algorithm to train an autonomous guidance policy using historic CAM data. In addition to maintaining acceptable collision risks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by making early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete action and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when to initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for conjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The Markov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the reliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which increases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked conjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation study on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average propellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy that initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On historical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant overall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM. For both historical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy achieves equal if not higher overall collision risk guarantees.</description>

      <title>The Fourth State: Signed-Zero Ternary for Stable LLM Quantization (and More)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization is usually regarded as a means to trade quality of performance for reduced compute requirements, i.e., as a suboptimal approximation. However, if examined in terms of a fixed overall resource budget, a very different perspective arises. We introduce Signed-Zero Ternary (SZT), a 2-bit quantization that deterministically provides gradient information with no forward-path penalty. Our analysis provides evidence that it may improve information density compared to non-quantized alternatives.</description>

      <title>Dual Signal Decomposition of Stochastic Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research paper addresses decomposition of a stochastic time series into three time series representing a dual signal i.e., the mean and the dispersion, with noise isolated. Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit a dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises between fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the dual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order derivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the regularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on Statistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be applied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time series. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a denoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been considered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal first and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly. Jointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with heteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear unconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have sequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function hyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic process without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the hyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states by stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be represented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast both mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time series.</description>

      <title>Fast, Convex and Conditioned Network for Multi-Fidelity Vectors and Stiff Univariate Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accuracy in neural PDE solvers often breaks down not because of limited expressivity, but due to poor optimisation caused by ill-conditioning, especially in multi-fidelity and stiff problems. We study this issue in Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs), a convex variant of neural PDE solvers, and show that asymptotic components in governing equations can produce highly ill-conditioned activation matrices, severely limiting convergence. We introduce Shifted Gaussian Encoding, a simple yet effective activation filtering step that increases matrix rank and expressivity while preserving convexity. Our method extends the solvable range of Peclet numbers in steady advection-diffusion equations by over two orders of magnitude, achieves up to six orders lower error on multi-frequency function learning, and fits high-fidelity image vectors more accurately and faster than deep networks with over a million parameters. This work highlights that conditioning, not depth, is often the bottleneck in scientific neural solvers and that simple architectural changes can unlock substantial gains.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Think-Answer Mismatch in LLM Reasoning Through Noise-Aware Advantage Reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a key technique for training large reasoning models, yet it suffers from a critical vulnerability: the \emph{Think-Answer Mismatch}, where noisy reward signals corrupt the learning process. This problem is most severe in unbalanced response groups, paradoxically degrading the signal precisely when it should be most informative. To address this challenge, we propose Stable Group-Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO), a principled enhancement that derives optimal, noise-aware advantage weights to stabilize training. Our comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate S-GRPO's effectiveness and robustness. On various models, S-GRPO significantly outperforms DR. GRPO, achieving performance gains of +2.5% on Qwen-Math-7B-Base, +2.2% on Llama-3.2-3B-Base, and +2.4% on Qwen-Math-1.5B-Instruct. Most critically, while standard GRPO fails to learn under 20% synthetic reward noise, S-GRPO maintains stable learning progress. These results highlight S-GRPO's potential for more robust and effective training of large-scale reasoning models. \footnote{Code and data are available at: https://github.com/shenpeijun0212/S-GRPO</description>

      <title>Multi-Armed Bandits-Based Optimization of Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision trees, without appropriate constraints, can easily become overly complex and prone to overfit, capturing noise rather than generalizable patterns. To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in optimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but also decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional pruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning (REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in performance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might result in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust ability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly when trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are proposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate an optimal decision tree with better generalization. Our proposed approach assumes the pruning process as an exploration-exploitation problem, where we are utilizing the MAB algorithms to find optimal branch nodes to prune based on feedback from each pruning actions. Experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets, demonstrated that our proposed approach results in better predictive performance compared to the traditional ones. This suggests the potential of utilizing MAB for a dynamic and probabilistic way of decision tree pruning, in turn optimizing the decision tree-based model.</description>

      <title>Mildly Conservative Regularized Evaluation for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to learn optimal policies from static datasets without further environment interaction. A key challenge is the distribution shift between the learned and behavior policies, leading to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions and overestimation. To prevent gross overestimation, the value function must remain conservative; however, excessive conservatism may hinder performance improvement. To address this, we propose the mildly conservative regularized evaluation (MCRE) framework, which balances conservatism and performance by combining temporal difference (TD) error with a behavior cloning term in the Bellman backup. Building on this, we develop the mildly conservative regularized Q-learning (MCRQ) algorithm, which integrates MCRE into an off-policy actor-critic framework. Experiments show that MCRQ outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>LinguaFluid: Language Guided Fluid Control via Semantic Rewards in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning the current state with a target semantic instruction using a Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT). Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models (LLMs) and fluid control applications.</description>

      <title>Parameter-free Optimal Rates for Nonlinear Semi-Norm Contractions with Applications to $Q$-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms for solving \textit{nonlinear} fixed-point equations -- such as average-reward \textit{$Q$-learning} and \textit{TD-learning} -- often involve semi-norm contractions. Achieving parameter-free optimal convergence rates for these methods via Polyak--Ruppert averaging has remained elusive, largely due to the non-monotonicity of such semi-norms. We close this gap by (i.) recasting the averaged error as a linear recursion involving a nonlinear perturbation, and (ii.) taming the nonlinearity by coupling the semi-norm's contraction with the monotonicity of a suitably induced norm. Our main result yields the first parameter-free $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ optimal rates for $Q$-learning in both average-reward and exponentially discounted settings, where $t$ denotes the iteration index. The result applies within a broad framework that accommodates synchronous and asynchronous updates, single-agent and distributed deployments, and data streams obtained either from simulators or along Markovian trajectories.</description>

      <title>Pruning the Unsurprising: Efficient Code Reasoning via First-Token Surprisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code reasoning by scaling up the length of Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, excessively long reasoning traces introduce substantial challenges in terms of training cost, inference latency, and deployment feasibility. While various CoT compression approaches have emerged to address this challenge, they face inherent trade-offs: token-level methods often disrupt syntactic and logical coherence, while step-level methods based on perplexity fail to reliably capture the logically critical reasoning steps. In this paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel coarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided pruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the search space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning by selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token surprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and leverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in coding tasks. Experiments show that ASAP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple code generation benchmarks while substantially reducing training and inference costs. On the challenging LiveCodeBench v4_v5 benchmark, our approach reduces token generation by 23.5% and inference latency by 43.5% compared to the strongest baseline, while achieving a competitive accuracy of 36.19% in Pass@1. Our results highlight a promising direction for building powerful and efficient LRMs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Prompt Sequences using Monte Carlo Tree Search for LLM-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation and structured reasoning; however, their performance often degrades on complex tasks that require consistent multi-step planning. Recent work has explored combining LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), yet existing approaches primarily focus on generating heuristic-based code for optimization or target simpler tasks where correctness alone is sufficient. In this work, we propose MCTS-OPS, a novel neural-symbolic framework that formulates prompt selection as a sequential decision process guided by MCTS. Our method explores and refines multi-step prompt sequences for the goal of improving code generation quality and enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in general optimization. Experiments on network optimization show significant improvement over the baselines, both in the success rate of executing the generated code and in the optimization results with the specified objective and constraints (2$\sim$4$\times$ higher reward and 3$\times$ lower standard deviation). Moreover, it improves the chance of attaining the optimal solution by about 10\% of cases, compared to baseline methods in hard problems. These results highlight the promise of combining symbolic planning with LLMs for robust, high-quality code generation in complex domains.</description>

      <title>Stepwise Fine and Gray: Subject-Specific Variable Selection Shows When Hemodynamic Data Improves Prognostication of Comatose Post-Cardiac Arrest Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prognostication for comatose post-cardiac arrest patients is a critical challenge that directly impacts clinical decision-making in the ICU. Clinical information that informs prognostication is collected serially over time. Shortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are collected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU admission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic data (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as two phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel stepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of neurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of time-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase). Notably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying hemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this information is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient over time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our approach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two phases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear feature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose post-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance for the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, and death despite maximal support. Our approach generalizes to more than two phases in which new features are collected and could be used in other dynamic prediction tasks, where it may be helpful to know when and for whom newly collected features significantly improve prediction.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks: Bridging Heterophily and Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are common in real-world scenarios and often exhibit heterophily. However, most existing studies focus on either heterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of heterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their performance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in modeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and meta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of semantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN employs a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily distributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages from diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which filters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven real-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of AHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.</description>

      <title>DP-LLM: Runtime Model Adaptation with Dynamic Layer-wise Precision Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we effectively handle queries for on-device large language models (LLMs) with varying runtime constraints, such as latency and accuracy? Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution, we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of each layer dynamically changes across decoding iterations. Building on this insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns precision to each layer based on input values. DP-LLM augments each linear layer in an LLM with a precision selector that determines the bitwidth at runtime using a lightweight error estimator and threshold values learned through fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off, outperforming prior approaches.</description>

      <title>Architecture-Aware Generalization Bounds for Temporal Networks: Theory and Fair Comparison Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep temporal architectures such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) achieve strong predictive performance on sequential data, yet theoretical understanding of their generalization remains limited. We address this gap by providing both the first non-vacuous, architecture-aware generalization bounds for deep temporal models and a principled evaluation methodology.
  For exponentially $\beta$-mixing sequences, we derive bounds scaling as $ O\!\Bigl(R\,\sqrt{\tfrac{D\,p\,n\,\log N}{N}}\Bigr), $ where $D$ is network depth, $p$ kernel size, $n$ input dimension, and $R$ weight norm. Our delayed-feedback blocking mechanism transforms dependent samples into effectively independent ones while discarding only $O(1/\log N)$ of the data, yielding $\sqrt{D}$ scaling instead of exponential, implying that doubling depth requires approximately quadrupling the training data.
  We also introduce a fair-comparison methodology that fixes the effective sample size to isolate the effect of temporal structure from information content. Under $N_{\text{eff}}=2{,}000$, strongly dependent sequences ($\rho=0.8$) exhibit $\approx76\%$ smaller generalization gaps than weakly dependent ones ($\rho=0.2$), challenging the intuition that dependence is purely detrimental. Yet convergence rates diverge from theory: weak dependencies follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-1.21}$ scaling and strong dependencies follow $N_{\text{eff}}^{-0.89}$, both steeper than the predicted $N^{-0.5}$. These findings reveal that temporal dependence can enhance learning under fixed information budgets, while highlighting gaps between theory and practice that motivate future research.</description>

Abstract: While differentiable logic gates have shown promise in feedforward networks, their application to sequential modeling remains unexplored. This paper presents the first implementation of Recurrent Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (RDDLGN), combining Boolean operations with recurrent architectures for sequence-to-sequence learning.
  Evaluated on WMT'14 English-German translation, RDDLGN achieves 5.00 BLEU and 30.9\% accuracy during training, approaching GRU performance (5.41 BLEU) and graceful degradation (4.39 BLEU) during inference. This work establishes recurrent logic-based neural computation as viable, opening research directions for FPGA acceleration in sequential modeling and other recursive network architectures.</description>

      <title>GCHR : Goal-Conditioned Hindsight Regularization for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) with sparse rewards remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While hindsight experience replay (HER) has shown promise by relabeling collected trajectories with achieved goals, we argue that trajectory relabeling alone does not fully exploit the available experiences in off-policy GCRL methods, resulting in limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose Hindsight Goal-conditioned Regularization (HGR), a technique that generates action regularization priors based on hindsight goals. When combined with hindsight self-imitation regularization (HSR), our approach enables off-policy RL algorithms to maximize experience utilization. Compared to existing GCRL methods that employ HER and self-imitation techniques, our hindsight regularizations achieve substantially more efficient sample reuse and the best performances, which we empirically demonstrate on a suite of navigation and manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Improving Diagnostic Accuracy for Oral Cancer with inpainting Synthesis Lesions Generated Using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In oral cancer diagnostics, the limited availability of annotated datasets frequently constrains the performance of diagnostic models, particularly due to the variability and insufficiency of training data. To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Federated Clustering with Random Rebalancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated clustering aims to group similar clients into clusters and produce one model for each cluster. Such a personalization approach typically improves model performance compared with training a single model to serve all clients, but can be more vulnerable to privacy leakage. Directly applying client-level differentially private (DP) mechanisms to federated clustering could degrade the utilities significantly. We identify that such deficiencies are mainly due to the difficulties of averaging privacy noise within each cluster (following standard privacy mechanisms), as the number of clients assigned to the same clusters is uncontrolled. To this end, we propose a simple and effective technique, named RR-Cluster, that can be viewed as a light-weight add-on to many federated clustering algorithms. RR-Cluster achieves reduced privacy noise via randomly rebalancing cluster assignments, guaranteeing a minimum number of clients assigned to each cluster. We analyze the tradeoffs between decreased privacy noise variance and potentially increased bias from incorrect assignments and provide convergence bounds for RR-Clsuter. Empirically, we demonstrate the RR-Cluster plugged into strong federated clustering algorithms results in significantly improved privacy/utility tradeoffs across both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities, architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer practical recommendations.</description>

      <title>Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated recommendation systems (FedRecs) have gained significant attention for providing privacy-preserving recommendation services. However, existing FedRecs assume that all users have the same requirements for privacy protection, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server. The approaches overlook the potential to enhance the recommendation service by utilizing publicly available user data. In real-world applications, users can choose to be private or public. Private users' interaction data is not shared, while public users' interaction data can be shared. Inspired by the issue, this paper proposes a novel Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy Recommendation (GFed-PP) that adapts to different privacy requirements while improving recommendation performance. GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data of public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to form a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To protect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring function locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated recommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on clients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server. Experimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms existing methods for five datasets, offering superior recommendation accuracy without compromising privacy. This framework provides a practical solution for accommodating varying privacy preferences in federated recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reparameterization policy gradient (RPG) is promising for improving sample efficiency by leveraging differentiable dynamics. However, a critical barrier is its training instability, where high-variance gradients can destabilize the learning process. To address this, we draw inspiration from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which uses a surrogate objective to enable stable sample reuse in the model-free setting. We first establish a connection between this surrogate objective and RPG, which has been largely unexplored and is non-trivial. Then, we bridge this gap by demonstrating that the reparameterization gradient of a PPO-like surrogate objective can be computed efficiently using backpropagation through time. Based on this key insight, we propose Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization (RPO), a stable and sample-efficient RPG-based method. RPO enables multiple epochs of stable sample reuse by optimizing a clipped surrogate objective tailored for RPG, while being further stabilized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and remaining fully compatible with existing variance reduction methods. We evaluate RPO on a suite of challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks, where experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample efficiency and strong performance.</description>

      <title>SCAR: State-Space Compression for AI-Driven Resource Management in 6G-Enabled Vehicular Infotainment Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of 6G networks opens new possibilities for connected infotainment services in vehicular environments. However, traditional Radio Resource Management (RRM) techniques struggle with the increasing volume and complexity of data such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQI) from autonomous vehicles. To address this, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Driven Resource Management), an Edge AI-assisted framework that optimizes scheduling and fairness in vehicular infotainment. SCAR employs ML-based compression techniques (e.g., clustering and RBF networks) to reduce CQI data size while preserving essential features. These compressed states are used to train 6G-enabled Reinforcement Learning policies that maximize throughput while meeting fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulations show that SCAR increases time in feasible scheduling regions by 14\% and reduces unfair scheduling time by 15\% compared to RL baselines without CQI compression. Furthermore, Simulated Annealing with Stochastic Tunneling (SAST)-based clustering reduces CQI clustering distortion by 10\%, confirming its efficiency. These results demonstrate SCAR's scalability and fairness benefits for dynamic vehicular networks.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attack with Partial Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models have been shown to be susceptible to membership inference attack, which can be used to determine whether a given sample appears in the training data. Existing membership inference methods commonly assume that the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This assumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only partial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the adversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer whether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target model. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI). To address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and Anomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD optimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the second stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and the training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results demonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains compatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques. For example, on STL-10, our attack achieves an AUC of around 0.6 even with 40% of the missing features.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Regret for Efficient Stochastic Combinatorial Semi-Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) is a cornerstone of sequential decision-making framework, dominated by two algorithmic families: UCB-based and adversarial methods such as follow the regularized leader (FTRL) and online mirror descent (OMD). However, prominent UCB-based approaches like CUCB suffer from additional regret factor $\log T$ that is detrimental over long horizons, while adversarial methods such as EXP3.M and HYBRID impose significant computational overhead. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce the Combinatorial Minimax Optimal Strategy in the Stochastic setting (CMOSS). CMOSS is a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves an instance-independent regret of $O\big( (\log k)^2\sqrt{kmT}\big )$ under semi-bandit feedback, where $m$ is the number of arms and $k$ is the maximum cardinality of a feasible action. Crucially, this result eliminates the dependency on $\log T$ and matches the established $\Omega\big( \sqrt{kmT}\big)$ lower bound up to $O\big((\log k)^2\big)$. We then extend our analysis to show that CMOSS is also applicable to cascading feedback. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate that CMOSS consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in both regret and runtime efficiency.</description>

      <title>In-Training Defenses against Emergent Misalignment in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning lets practitioners repurpose aligned large language models (LLMs) for new domains, yet recent work reveals emergent misalignment (EMA): Even a small, domain-specific fine-tune can induce harmful behaviors far outside the target domain. Even in the case where model weights are hidden behind a fine-tuning API, this gives attackers inadvertent access to a broadly misaligned model in a way that can be hard to detect from the fine-tuning data alone. We present the first systematic study of in-training safeguards against EMA that are practical for providers who expose fine-tuning via an API. We investigate four training regularization interventions: (i) KL-divergence regularization toward a safe reference model, (ii) $\ell_2$ distance in feature space, (iii) projecting onto a safe subspace (SafeLoRA), and (iv) interleaving of a small amount of safe training examples from a general instruct-tuning dataset. We first evaluate the methods' emergent misalignment effect across four malicious, EMA-inducing tasks. Second, we assess the methods' impacts on benign tasks. We conclude with a discussion of open questions in emergent misalignment research.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation and Differential Privacy using Tensor Networks' Matrix Product States (MPS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE, and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities. To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\'enyi Differential Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints. This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and confidentiality are critical.</description>

      <title>Multi-Omics Analysis for Cancer Subtype Inference via Unrolling Graph Smoothness Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating multi-omics datasets through data-driven analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of the complex biological processes underlying various diseases, particularly cancer. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data. Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>OM2P: Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization, we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision. Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a 3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time. Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.</description>

      <title>A Study on Regularization-Based Continual Learning Methods for Indic ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indias linguistic diversity poses significant challenges for developing inclusive Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Traditional multilingual models, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical due to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual Learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages sequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge. This paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the IndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model, initially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight additional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We evaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning without Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay, privacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate (WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as knowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of varying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task. Results, compared against naive fine-tuning, demonstrate CLs effectiveness in mitigating forgetting, making it a promising approach for scalable ASR in diverse Indian languages under realistic constraints.

      <title>Low-Bit Data Processing Using Multiple-Output Spiking Neurons with Non-linear Reset Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is an emerging technology enabling low-latency and energy-efficient signal processing. A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic computing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired neural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data processing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs, deep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep SSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal modeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions and no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent deep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that combines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback mechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our proposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking function, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on various tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a sequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves performance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature. Our results illustrate how the proposed reset mechanism can overcome instability and enable learning even when the linear part of neuron dynamics is unstable, allowing us to go beyond the strictly enforced stability of linear dynamics in recent deep SSM models.</description>

      <title>FedMeNF: Privacy-Preserving Federated Meta-Learning for Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural fields provide a memory-efficient representation of data, which can effectively handle diverse modalities and large-scale data. However, learning to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning (FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Partner Design Enables Robust Ad-hoc Teamwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Partner Design (UPD) - a population-free, multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for robust ad-hoc teamwork that adaptively generates training partners without requiring pretrained partners or manual parameter tuning. UPD constructs diverse partners by stochastically mixing an ego agent's policy with biased random behaviours and scores them using a variance-based learnability metric that prioritises partners near the ego agent's current learning frontier. We show that UPD can be integrated with unsupervised environment design, resulting in the first method enabling fully unsupervised curricula over both level and partner distributions in a cooperative setting. Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the Overcooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner curriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both population-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user study, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and was perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better collaborator, and less frustrating.</description>

      <title>Introducing Fractional Classification Loss for Robust Learning with Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust loss functions are crucial for training deep neural networks in the presence of label noise, yet existing approaches require extensive, dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Fractional Classification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically calibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the active-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that the fractional derivative order $\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that interpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence. Furthermore, we integrate $\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a learnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off between robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property establishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\mu$: lower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but impose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in them. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve effective classification performance under label noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that FCL achieves state-of-the-art results without the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Structural Equation-VAE: Disentangled Latent Representations for Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning interpretable latent representations from tabular data remains a challenge in deep generative modeling. We introduce SE-VAE (Structural Equation-Variational Autoencoder), a novel architecture that embeds measurement structure directly into the design of a variational autoencoder. Inspired by structural equation modeling, SE-VAE aligns latent subspaces with known indicator groupings and introduces a global nuisance latent to isolate construct-specific confounding variation. This modular architecture enables disentanglement through design rather than through statistical regularizers alone. We evaluate SE-VAE on a suite of simulated tabular datasets and benchmark its performance against a series of leading baselines using standard disentanglement metrics. SE-VAE consistently outperforms alternatives in factor recovery, interpretability, and robustness to nuisance variation. Ablation results reveal that architectural structure, rather than regularization strength, is the key driver of performance. SE-VAE offers a principled framework for white-box generative modeling in scientific and social domains where latent constructs are theory-driven and measurement validity is essential.</description>

      <title>Geometric-k-means: A Bound Free Approach to Fast and Eco-Friendly k-means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Geometric-k-means (or Gk-means for short), a novel approach that significantly enhances the efficiency and energy economy of the widely utilized k-means algorithm, which, despite its inception over five decades ago, remains a cornerstone in machine learning applications. The essence of Gk-means lies in its active utilization of geometric principles, specifically scalar projection, to significantly accelerate the algorithm without sacrificing solution quality. This geometric strategy enables a more discerning focus on data points that are most likely to influence cluster updates, which we call as high expressive data (HE). In contrast, low expressive data (LE), does not impact clustering outcome, is effectively bypassed, leading to considerable reductions in computational overhead. Experiments spanning synthetic, real-world and high-dimensional datasets, demonstrate Gk-means is significantly better than traditional and state of the art (SOTA) k-means variants in runtime and distance computations (DC). Moreover, Gk-means exhibits better resource efficiency, as evidenced by its reduced energy footprint, placing it as more sustainable alternative.</description>

      <title>Beyond Prompt-Induced Lies: Investigating LLM Deception on Benign Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical concern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a significant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such deception by explicitly setting a "hidden" objective through prompting or fine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions. Moving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this evaluation, we propose a novel framework using "contact searching questions." This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive Intention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The second, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's internal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we find that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in parallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a mathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when handling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM agents in complex and crucial domains.</description>

      <title>ActivityDiff: A diffusion model with Positive and Negative Activity Guidance for De Novo Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving precise control over a molecule's biological activity-encompassing targeted activation/inhibition, cooperative multi-target modulation, and off-target toxicity mitigation-remains a critical challenge in de novo drug design. However, existing generative methods primarily focus on producing molecules with a single desired activity, lacking integrated mechanisms for the simultaneous management of multiple intended and unintended molecular interactions. Here, we propose ActivityDiff, a generative approach based on the classifier-guidance technique of diffusion models. It leverages separately trained drug-target classifiers for both positive and negative guidance, enabling the model to enhance desired activities while minimizing harmful off-target effects. Experimental results show that ActivityDiff effectively handles essential drug design tasks, including single-/dual-target generation, fragment-constrained dual-target design, selective generation to enhance target specificity, and reduction of off-target effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion in balancing efficacy and safety in molecular design. Overall, our work introduces a novel paradigm for achieving integrated control over molecular activity, and provides ActivityDiff as a versatile and extensible framework.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Text-to-SQL with Dataset Selection: Leveraging LLMs for Adaptive Query Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL bridges the gap between natural language and structured database language, thus allowing non-technical users to easily query databases. Traditional approaches model text-to-SQL as a direct translation task, where a given Natural Language Query (NLQ) is mapped to an SQL command. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation accuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is pre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive databases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet overlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL framework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL queries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit information from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We then train a large db\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based finetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\_id) based on both the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL by using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database intent prediction and SQL generation accuracy.</description>

      <title>A New Lens on Homelessness: Daily Tent Monitoring with 311 Calls and Street Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homelessness in the United States has surged to levels unseen since the Great Depression. However, existing methods for monitoring it, such as point-in-time (PIT) counts, have limitations in terms of frequency, consistency, and spatial detail. This study proposes a new approach using publicly available, crowdsourced data, specifically 311 Service Calls and street-level imagery, to track and forecast homeless tent trends in San Francisco. Our predictive model captures fine-grained daily and neighborhood-level variations, uncovering patterns that traditional counts often overlook, such as rapid fluctuations during the COVID-19 pandemic and spatial shifts in tent locations over time. By providing more timely, localized, and cost-effective information, this approach serves as a valuable tool for guiding policy responses and evaluating interventions aimed at reducing unsheltered homelessness.</description>

      <title>Sample-efficient LLM Optimization with Reset Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective, combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical, sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking greater performance from limited data.</description>

      <title>LLM Unlearning using Gradient Ratio-Based Influence Estimation and Noise Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing legal and ethical scrutiny of large language models (LLMs) necessitates effective machine unlearning, particularly for sensitive or unauthorized data. Existing empirical methods often yield incomplete forgetting or unintended degradation of unrelated knowledge due to poor localization. In this work, we propose GRIN: a modular and targeted framework for LLM unlearning. GRIN introduces a novel gradient-ratio-based metric to identify parameters most responsible for memorizing forget data. We then perform selective noise injection into these parameters prior to fine-tuning, which improves unlearning performance while maintaining model utility. Finally, we propose new evaluation metrics tailored to the LLM setting and validate our approach on standard benchmarks such as TOFU, WMDP, and SafePKU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01854v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven learning framework for identifying governing laws of generalized diffusions with non-gradient components. By combining energy dissipation laws with a physically consistent penalty and first-moment evolution, we design a two-stage method to recover the pseudo-potential and rotation in the pointwise orthogonal decomposition of a class of non-gradient drifts in generalized diffusions. Our two-stage method is applied to complex generalized diffusion processes including dissipation-rotation dynamics, rough pseudo-potentials and noisy data. Representative numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for learning physical laws in non-gradient generalized diffusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective query reformulation is pivotal in narrowing the gap between a user's exploratory search behavior and the identification of relevant products in e-commerce environments. While traditional approaches predominantly model query rewrites as isolated pairs, they often fail to capture the sequential and transitional dynamics inherent in real-world user behavior. In this work, we propose a novel framework that explicitly models transitional queries--intermediate reformulations occurring during the user's journey toward their final purchase intent. By mining structured query trajectories from eBay's large-scale user interaction logs, we reconstruct query sequences that reflect shifts in intent while preserving semantic coherence. This approach allows us to model a user's shopping funnel, where mid-journey transitions reflect exploratory behavior and intent refinement. Furthermore, we incorporate generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce semantically diverse and intent-preserving alternative queries, extending beyond what can be derived through collaborative filtering alone. These reformulations can be leveraged to populate Related Searches or to power intent-clustered carousels on the search results page, enhancing both discovery and engagement. Our contributions include (i) the formal identification and modeling of transitional queries, (ii) the introduction of a structured query sequence mining pipeline for intent flow understanding, and (iii) the application of LLMs for scalable, intent-aware query expansion. Empirical evaluation demonstrates measurable gains in conversion and engagement metrics compared to the existing Related Searches module, validating the effectiveness of our approach in real-world e-commerce settings.</description>

      <title>Random Walk Learning and the Pac-Man Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.</description>

      <title>HySemRAG: A Hybrid Semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Automated Literature Synthesis and Methodological Gap Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present HySemRAG, a framework that combines Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate large-scale literature synthesis and identify methodological research gaps. The system addresses limitations in existing RAG architectures through a multi-layered approach: hybrid retrieval combining semantic search, keyword filtering, and knowledge graph traversal; an agentic self-correction framework with iterative quality assurance; and post-hoc citation verification ensuring complete traceability. Our implementation processes scholarly literature through eight integrated stages: multi-source metadata acquisition, asynchronous PDF retrieval, custom document layout analysis using modified Docling architecture, bibliographic management, LLM-based field extraction, topic modeling, semantic unification, and knowledge graph construction. The system creates dual data products - a Neo4j knowledge graph enabling complex relationship queries and Qdrant vector collections supporting semantic search - serving as foundational infrastructure for verifiable information synthesis. Evaluation across 643 observations from 60 testing sessions demonstrates structured field extraction achieving 35.1% higher semantic similarity scores (0.655 $\pm$ 0.178) compared to PDF chunking approaches (0.485 $\pm$ 0.204, p &lt; 0.000001). The agentic quality assurance mechanism achieves 68.3% single-pass success rates with 99.0% citation accuracy in validated responses. Applied to geospatial epidemiology literature on ozone exposure and cardiovascular disease, the system identifies methodological trends and research gaps, demonstrating broad applicability across scientific domains for accelerating evidence synthesis and discovery.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models for Markdown Conversion of Financial Tables in Malaysian Audited Financial Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately extracting and representing the structure of tabular data from financial documents remains a critical challenge in document understanding, particularly for regulatory and analytical use cases. This study addresses the complexity of converting financial tables from Malaysian audited financial reports into Markdown format, a task complicated by rotated layouts, multi-level headers, and implicit structural cues. We propose a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM), based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, optimized for high-fidelity Markdown generation from document images. Our approach includes a curated dataset of 2,152 image-text pairs with augmentations and a supervised fine-tuning strategy using LoRA. To assess performance, we evaluated our model on 100 out-of-sample tables using a dual framework: a criteria-based LLM-as-a-judge for fine-grained accuracy and our novel Markdown Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric for holistic structural fidelity. Our model achieves a 92.20% overall accuracy on the criteria-based assessment and a 96.53% Markdown TEDS score. This performance significantly surpasses its Qwen2.5-VL-7B base model, larger-scale VLMs, and specialized reasoning-enabled models. Compared to these self-hosted alternatives, it also significantly reduces inference time. Furthermore, its accuracy exceeds that of widely used proprietary models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash. These results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning provides an effective and efficient method to bridge the gap between unstructured financial documents and downstream automation, rivalling much larger and more general models without their computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Top-$K$ Barrier: Advancing Top-$K$ Ranking Metrics Optimization in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of recommender systems (RS), Top-$K$ ranking metrics such as NDCG@$K$ are the gold standard for evaluating recommendation performance. However, during the training of recommendation models, optimizing NDCG@$K$ poses significant challenges due to its inherent discontinuous nature and the intricate Top-$K$ truncation. Recent efforts to optimize NDCG@$K$ have either overlooked the Top-$K$ truncation or suffered from high computational costs and training instability. To overcome these limitations, we propose SoftmaxLoss@$K$ (SL@$K$), a novel recommendation loss tailored for NDCG@$K$ optimization. Specifically, we integrate the quantile technique to handle Top-$K$ truncation and derive a smooth upper bound for optimizing NDCG@$K$ to address discontinuity. The resulting SL@$K$ loss has several desirable properties, including theoretical guarantees, ease of implementation, computational efficiency, gradient stability, and noise robustness. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three recommendation backbones demonstrate that SL@$K$ outperforms existing losses with a notable average improvement of 6.03%.

      <title>Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning and Prompt-Based Learning: A Comparative Study for developing Natural Language-Based BIM Information Retrieval Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building Information Modeling (BIM) is essential for managing building data across the entire lifecycle, supporting tasks from design to maintenance. Natural Language Interface (NLI) systems are increasingly explored as user-friendly tools for information retrieval in Building Information Modeling (BIM) environments. Despite their potential, accurately extracting BIM-related data through natural language queries remains a persistent challenge due to the complexity use queries and specificity of domain knowledge. This study presents a comparative analysis of two prominent approaches for developing NLI-based BIM information retrieval systems: domain-specific fine-tuning and prompt-based learning using large language models (LLMs). A two-stage framework consisting of intent recognition and table-based question answering is implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of both approaches. To support this evaluation, a BIM-specific dataset of 1,740 annotated queries of varying types across 69 models is constructed. Experimental results show that domain-specific fine-tuning delivers superior performance in intent recognition tasks, while prompt-based learning, particularly with GPT-4o, shows strength in table-based question answering. Based on these findings, this study identify a hybrid configuration that combines fine-tuning for intent recognition with prompt-based learning for question answering, achieving more balanced and robust performance across tasks. This integrated approach is further tested through case studies involving BIM models of varying complexity. This study provides a systematic analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach and discusses the applicability of the NLI to real-world BIM scenarios. The findings offer insights for researchers and practitioners in designing intelligent, language-driven BIM systems.</description>

This study performs a comprehensive evaluation on adversarial attack methods to identify and analyze their potential vulnerabilities. We formulate the diagnosis process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state is the patient responses and unasked questions, and the action is either to ask a question or to make a diagnosis. We implemented six prevailing major attack methods, including the Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Carlini &amp; Wagner Attack (C&amp;W) attack, Basic Iterative Method (BIM), DeepFool, and AutoAttack, with seven epsilon values each. To ensure the generated adversarial examples remain clinically plausible, we developed a comprehensive medical validation framework consisting of 247 medical constraints, including physiological bounds, symptom correlations, and conditional medical constraints. We achieved a 97.6% success rate in generating clinically plausible adversarial samples. We performed our experiment on the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/), which consists of 182,630 samples, to predict the participant's 4-year mortality rate. We evaluated our attacks on the AdaptiveFS framework proposed in arXiv:2004.00994. Our results show that adversarial attacks could significantly impact the diagnostic accuracy, with attack success rates ranging from 33.08% (FGSM) to 64.70% (AutoAttack). Our work has demonstrated that even under strict medical constraints on the input, such RL-based medical questionnaire systems still show significant vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>MM-FusionNet: Context-Aware Dynamic Fusion for Multi-modal Fake News Detection with Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05684</link>

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-modal fake news on social media poses a significant threat to public trust and social stability. Traditional detection methods, primarily text-based, often fall short due to the deceptive interplay between misleading text and images. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer promising avenues for multi-modal understanding, effectively fusing diverse modal information, especially when their importance is imbalanced or contradictory, remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces MM-FusionNet, an innovative framework leveraging LVLMs for robust multi-modal fake news detection. Our core contribution is the Context-Aware Dynamic Fusion Module (CADFM), which employs bi-directional cross-modal attention and a novel dynamic modal gating network. This mechanism adaptively learns and assigns importance weights to textual and visual features based on their contextual relevance, enabling intelligent prioritization of information. Evaluated on the large-scale Multi-modal Fake News Dataset (LMFND) comprising 80,000 samples, MM-FusionNet achieves a state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.938, surpassing existing multi-modal baselines by approximately 0.5% and significantly outperforming single-modal approaches. Further analysis demonstrates the model's dynamic weighting capabilities, its robustness to modality perturbations, and performance remarkably close to human-level, underscoring its practical efficacy and interpretability for real-world fake news detection.</description>

      <title>Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function. Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current input transformation methods. The code is available at https://github.com/ZezeTao/ResPA.</description>

      <title>Leveraging large language models for SQL behavior-based database intrusion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Database systems are extensively used to store critical data across various domains. However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise. Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the organization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect anomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences of operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent normal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble normal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to identify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for Structured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient, pre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while minimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses ensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned normal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope queries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using role-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings make a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for safeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.</description>

      <title>MambaITD: An Efficient Cross-Modal Mamba Network for Insider Threat Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enterprises are facing increasing risks of insider threats, while existing detection methods are unable to effectively address these challenges due to reasons such as insufficient temporal dynamic feature modeling, computational efficiency and real-time bottlenecks and cross-modal information island problem. This paper proposes a new insider threat detection framework MambaITD based on the Mamba state space model and cross-modal adaptive fusion. First, the multi-source log preprocessing module aligns heterogeneous data through behavioral sequence encoding, interval smoothing, and statistical feature extraction. Second, the Mamba encoder models long-range dependencies in behavioral and interval sequences, and combines the sequence and statistical information dynamically in combination with the gated feature fusion mechanism. Finally, we propose an adaptive threshold optimization method based on maximizing inter-class variance, which dynamically adjusts the decision threshold by analyzing the probability distribution, effectively identifies anomalies, and alleviates class imbalance and concept drift. Compared with traditional methods, MambaITD shows significant advantages in modeling efficiency and feature fusion capabilities, outperforming Transformer-based methods, and provides a more effective solution for insider threat detection.</description>

      <title>Multi-Faceted Large Embedding Tables for Pinterest Ads Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large embedding tables are indispensable in modern recommendation systems, thanks to their ability to effectively capture and memorize intricate details of interactions among diverse entities. As we explore integrating large embedding tables into Pinterest's ads ranking models, we encountered not only common challenges such as sparsity and scalability, but also several obstacles unique to our context. Notably, our initial attempts to train large embedding tables from scratch resulted in neutral metrics. To tackle this, we introduced a novel multi-faceted pretraining scheme that incorporates multiple pretraining algorithms. This approach greatly enriched the embedding tables and resulted in significant performance improvements. As a result, the multi-faceted large embedding tables bring great performance gain on both the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) domains. Moreover, we designed a CPU-GPU hybrid serving infrastructure to overcome GPU memory limits and elevate the scalability. This framework has been deployed in the Pinterest Ads system and achieved 1.34% online CPC reduction and 2.60% CTR increase with neutral end-to-end latency change.</description>

      <title>A Physiologically-Constrained Neural Network Digital Twin Framework for Replicating Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating glucose dynamics in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is critical for developing personalized treatments and supporting data-driven clinical decisions. Existing models often miss key physiological aspects and are difficult to individualize. Here, we introduce physiologically-constrained neural network (NN) digital twins to simulate glucose dynamics in T1D. To ensure interpretability and physiological consistency, we first build a population-level NN state-space model aligned with a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing glucose regulation. This model is formally verified to conform to known T1D dynamics. Digital twins are then created by augmenting the population model with individual-specific models, which include personal data, such as glucose management and contextual information, capturing both inter- and intra-individual variability. We validate our approach using real-world data from the T1D Exercise Initiative study. Two weeks of data per participant were split into 5-hour sequences and simulated glucose profiles were compared to observed ones. Clinically relevant outcomes were used to assess similarity via paired equivalence t-tests with predefined clinical equivalence margins. Across 394 digital twins, glucose outcomes were equivalent between simulated and observed data: time in range (70-180 mg/dL) was 75.1$\pm$21.2% (simulated) vs. 74.4$\pm$15.4% (real; P&lt;0.001); time below range (&lt;70 mg/dL) 2.5$\pm$5.2% vs. 3.0$\pm$3.3% (P=0.022); and time above range (&gt;180 mg/dL) 22.4$\pm$22.0% vs. 22.6$\pm$15.9% (P&lt;0.001). Our framework can incorporate unmodeled factors like sleep and activity while preserving key dynamics. This approach enables personalized in silico testing of treatments, supports insulin optimization, and integrates physics-based and data-driven modeling.

      <title>G-UBS: Towards Robust Understanding of Implicit Feedback via Group-Aware User Behavior Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User feedback is critical for refining recommendation systems, yet explicit feedback (e.g., likes or dislikes) remains scarce in practice. As a more feasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback has shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video usually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often noisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons, rather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests, thereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which leverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and in-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users. Specifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager (UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a ``summarize-cluster-reflect" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback Modeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning approach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the reinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the reasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have constructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit feedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k videos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback. Extensive experiments on IF-VR demonstrate that G-UBS significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs and MLLMs, with a 4.0% higher proportion of videos achieving a play rate &gt; 30% and 14.9% higher reasoning accuracy on IF-VR.</description>

      <title>Reduction Techniques for Survival Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss what we refer to as reduction techniques for survival analysis, that is, techniques that "reduce" a survival task to a more common regression or classification task, without ignoring the specifics of survival data. Such techniques particularly facilitate machine learning-based survival analysis, as they allow for applying standard tools from machine and deep learning to many survival tasks without requiring custom learners. We provide an overview of different reduction techniques and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. We also provide a principled implementation of some of these reductions, such that they are directly available within standard machine learning workflows. We illustrate each reduction using dedicated examples and perform a benchmark analysis that compares their predictive performance to established machine learning methods for survival analysis.</description>

      <title>Detecting Model Misspecification in Cosmology with Scale-Dependent Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current and upcoming cosmological surveys will produce unprecedented amounts of high-dimensional data, which require complex high-fidelity forward simulations to accurately model both physical processes and systematic effects which describe the data generation process. However, validating whether our theoretical models accurately describe the observed datasets remains a fundamental challenge. An additional complexity to this task comes from choosing appropriate representations of the data which retain all the relevant cosmological information, while reducing the dimensionality of the original dataset. In this work we present a novel framework combining scale-dependent neural summary statistics with normalizing flows to detect model misspecification in cosmological simulations through Bayesian evidence estimation. By conditioning our neural network models for data compression and evidence estimation on the smoothing scale, we systematically identify where theoretical models break down in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate a first application to our approach using matter and gas density fields from three CAMELS simulation suites with different subgrid physics implementations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields Against Experimental Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal machine learning force fields (UMLFFs) promise to revolutionize materials science by enabling rapid atomistic simulations across the periodic table. However, their evaluation has been limited to computational benchmarks that may not reflect real-world performance. Here, we present UniFFBench, a comprehensive framework for evaluating UMLFFs against experimental measurements of ~1,500 carefully curated mineral structures spanning diverse chemical environments, bonding types, structural complexity, and elastic properties. Our systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art UMLFFs reveals a substantial reality gap: models achieving impressive performance on computational benchmarks often fail when confronted with experimental complexity. Even the best-performing models exhibit higher density prediction error than the threshold required for practical applications. Most strikingly, we observe disconnects between simulation stability and mechanical property accuracy, with prediction errors correlating with training data representation rather than the modeling method. These findings demonstrate that while current computational benchmarks provide valuable controlled comparisons, they may overestimate model reliability when extrapolated to experimentally complex chemical spaces. Altogether, UniFFBench establishes essential experimental validation standards and reveals systematic limitations that must be addressed to achieve truly universal force field capabilities.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Trace Optimization of Parameter Dependent Matrices Based on Statistical Learning Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider matrices $\boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol\theta)\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ that depend, possibly nonlinearly, on a parameter $\boldsymbol\theta$ from a compact parameter space $\Theta$. We present a Monte Carlo estimator for minimizing $\text{trace}(\boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol\theta))$ over all $\boldsymbol\theta\in\Theta$, and determine the sampling amount so that the backward error of the estimator is bounded with high probability. We derive two types of bounds, based on epsilon nets and on generic chaining. Both types predict a small sampling amount for matrices $\boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol\theta)$ with small offdiagonal mass, and parameter spaces $\Theta$ of small ``size.'' Dependence on the matrix dimension~$m$ is only weak or not explicit. The bounds based on epsilon nets are easier to evaluate and come with fully specified constants. In contrast, the bounds based on chaining depend on the Talagrand functionals which are difficult to evaluate, except in very special cases. Comparisons between the two types of bounds are difficult, although the literature suggests that chaining bounds can be superior.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Inherently Safer AGI through Language-Mediated Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations. We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the system's core design through transparent belief representations and hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures. The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety measures.</description>

      <title>Integrating Vision Foundation Models with Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Object Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that integrates vision foundation models with reinforcement learning to enhance object interaction capabilities in simulated environments. By combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and YOLOv5 with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent operating in the AI2-THOR simulation environment, we enable the agent to perceive and interact with objects more effectively. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across four diverse indoor kitchen settings, demonstrate significant improvements in object interaction success rates and navigation efficiency compared to a baseline agent without advanced perception. The results show a 68% increase in average cumulative reward, a 52.5% improvement in object interaction success rate, and a 33% increase in navigation efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of integrating foundation models with reinforcement learning for complex robotic tasks, paving the way for more sophisticated and capable autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Bandits for Crowdsourcing and Multi-Platform Autobidding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in crowdsourcing, where a fixed sum of money is split among $K$ workers, and autobidding, where a fixed budget is used to bid in $K$ simultaneous auctions, we define a stochastic bandit model where arms belong to the $K$-dimensional probability simplex and represent the fraction of budget allocated to each task/auction. The reward in each round is the sum of $K$ stochastic rewards, where each of these rewards is unlocked with a probability that varies with the fraction of the budget allocated to that task/auction. We design an algorithm whose expected regret after $T$ steps is of order $K\sqrt{T}$ (up to log factors) and prove a matching lower bound. Improved bounds of order $K (\log T)^2$ are shown when the function mapping budget to probability of unlocking the reward (i.e., terminating the task or winning the auction) satisfies additional diminishing-returns conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards Transparent Ethical AI: A Roadmap for Trustworthy Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics increasingly permeate society, ensuring the ethical behavior of these systems has become paramount. This paper contends that transparency in AI decision-making processes is fundamental to developing trustworthy and ethically aligned robotic systems. We explore how transparency facilitates accountability, enables informed consent, and supports the debugging of ethical algorithms. The paper outlines technical, ethical, and practical challenges in implementing transparency and proposes novel approaches to enhance it, including standardized metrics, explainable AI techniques, and user-friendly interfaces. This paper introduces a framework that connects technical implementation with ethical considerations in robotic systems, focusing on the specific challenges of achieving transparency in dynamic, real-world contexts. We analyze how prioritizing transparency can impact public trust, regulatory policies, and avenues for future research. By positioning transparency as a fundamental element in ethical AI system design, we aim to add to the ongoing discussion on responsible AI and robotics, providing direction for future advancements in this vital field.</description>

      <title>Training chord recognition models on artificially generated audio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the challenging problems in Music Information Retrieval is the acquisition of enough non-copyrighted audio recordings for model training and evaluation. This study compares two Transformer-based neural network models for chord sequence recognition in audio recordings and examines the effectiveness of using an artificially generated dataset for this purpose. The models are trained on various combinations of Artificial Audio Multitracks (AAM), Schubert's Winterreise Dataset, and the McGill Billboard Dataset and evaluated with three metrics: Root, MajMin and Chord Content Metric (CCM). The experiments prove that even though there are certainly differences in complexity and structure between artificially generated and human-composed music, the former can be useful in certain scenarios. Specifically, AAM can enrich a smaller training dataset of music composed by a human or can even be used as a standalone training set for a model that predicts chord sequences in pop music, if no other data is available.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Physics-Machine Learning Models for Quantitative Electron Diffraction Refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity electron microscopy simulations required for quantitative crystal structure refinements face a fundamental challenge: while physical interactions are well-described theoretically, real-world experimental effects are challenging to model analytically. To address this gap, we present a novel hybrid physics-machine learning framework that integrates differentiable physical simulations with neural networks. By leveraging automatic differentiation throughout the simulation pipeline, our method enables gradient-based joint optimization of physical parameters and neural network components representing experimental variables, offering superior scalability compared to traditional second-order methods. We demonstrate this framework through application to three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D-ED) structure refinement, where our approach learns complex thickness distributions directly from diffraction data rather than relying on simplified geometric models. This method achieves state-of-the-art refinement performance across synthetic and experimental datasets, recovering atomic positions, thermal displacements, and thickness profiles with high fidelity. The modular architecture proposed can naturally be extended to accommodate additional physical phenomena and extended to other electron microscopy techniques. This establishes differentiable hybrid modeling as a powerful new paradigm for quantitative electron microscopy, where experimental complexities have historically limited analysis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Construction Site Analysis and Understanding with 3D Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios. Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and precise monitoring techniques.</description>

      <title>ASLSL: Adaptive shared latent structure learning with incomplete multi-modal physiological data for multi-dimensional emotional feature selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, multi-modal physiological signals based emotion recognition has garnered increasing attention in the field of brain-computer interfaces. Nevertheness, the associated multi-modal physiological features are often high-dimensional and inevitably include irrelevant, redundant, and noisy representation, which can easily lead to overfitting, poor performance, and high computational complexity in emotion classifiers. Feature selection has been widely applied to address these challenges. However, previous studies generally assumed that multi-modal physiological data are complete, whereas in reality, the data are often incomplete due to the openness of the acquisition and operational environment. For example, a part of samples are available in several modalities but not in others. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for incomplete multi-modal physiological signal feature selection called adaptive shared latent structure learning (ASLSL). Based on the property that similar features share similar emotional labels, ASLSL employs adaptive shared latent structure learning to explore a common latent space shared for incomplete multi-modal physiological signals and multi-dimensional emotional labels, thereby mitigating the impact of missing information and mining consensus information. Two most popular multi-modal physiological emotion datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels were utilized to compare the performance between compare ASLSL and seventeen feature selection methods. Comprehensive experimental results on these datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ASLSL.</description>

      <title>DAFMSVC: One-Shot Singing Voice Conversion with Dual Attention Mechanism and Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) transfers a source singer's timbre to a target while keeping melody and lyrics. The key challenge in any-to-any SVC is adapting unseen speaker timbres to source audio without quality degradation. Existing methods either face timbre leakage or fail to achieve satisfactory timbre similarity and quality in the generated audio. To address these challenges, we propose DAFMSVC, where the self-supervised learning (SSL) features from the source audio are replaced with the most similar SSL features from the target audio to prevent timbre leakage. It also incorporates a dual cross-attention mechanism for the adaptive fusion of speaker embeddings, melody, and linguistic content. Additionally, we introduce a flow matching module for high quality audio generation from the fused features. Experimental results show that DAFMSVC significantly enhances timbre similarity and naturalness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.</description>

      <title>ETA: Energy-based Test-time Adaptation for Depth Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution (target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution. We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'', or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors.

      <title>Position: Intelligent Coding Systems Should Write Programs with Justifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent coding systems are transforming software development by enabling users to specify code behavior in natural language. However, the opaque decision-making of AI-driven coders raises trust and usability concerns, particularly for non-expert users who cannot inspect low-level implementations. We argue that these systems should not only generate code but also produce clear, consistent justifications that bridge model reasoning and user understanding. To this end, we identify two critical justification properties-cognitive alignment and semantic faithfulness-and highlight the limitations of existing methods, including formal verification, static analysis, and post-hoc explainability. We advocate exploring neuro-symbolic approaches for justification generation, where symbolic constraints guide model behavior during training and program semantics are enriched through neural representations, enabling automated consistency checks at inference time.</description>

      <title>Improved Sub-Visible Particle Classification in Flow Imaging Microscopy via Generative AI-Based Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles. However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure. To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising 500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at https://github.com/utkuozbulak/svp-generative-ai.</description>

      <title>Efficient Knowledge Probing of Large Language Models by Adapting Pre-trained Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as science, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training. However, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have acquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by investigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts, curating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However, these methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to probe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally expensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{PEEK}$ or $\textbf{P}$roxy $\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\textbf{E}$stimate $\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models that effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for LLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various probing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs with a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived datasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict LLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find that sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to predict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the factual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be used to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper insights into LLMs' internal inductive bias. The code and data are made available at https://github.com/claws-lab/peek.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the data-driven chance-constrained density steering problem using the Gromov-Wasserstein metric. The underlying dynamical system is an unknown linear controlled recursion, with the assumption that sufficiently rich input-output data from pre-operational experiments are available. The initial state is modeled as a Gaussian mixture, while the terminal state is required to match a specified Gaussian distribution. We reformulate the resulting optimal control problem as a difference-of-convex program and show that it can be efficiently and tractably solved using the DC algorithm. Numerical results validate our approach through various data-driven schemes.</description>

      <title>AGI for the Earth, the path, possibilities and how to evaluate intelligence of models that work with Earth Observation Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a reality, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the research community to collect and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio. Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality, has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to understand and interact with Earth observation data.</description>

      <title>Don't Forget Imagination!</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive imagination is a type of imagination that plays a key role in human thinking. It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to mentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links that serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction. Our position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly underestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current capabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary contexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the context for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable. Thus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater attention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in artificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination, we propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can learn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal relationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they ensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach that allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of interrelated facts glued together with causal relations.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Auto-bidding based on Traffic Prediction in Live Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet live streaming is widely used in online entertainment and e-commerce, where live advertising is an important marketing tool for anchors. An advertising campaign hopes to maximize the effect (such as conversions) under constraints (such as budget and cost-per-click). The mainstream control of campaigns is auto-bidding, where the performance depends on the decision of the bidding algorithm in each request. The most widely used auto-bidding algorithms include Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, linear programming (LP), reinforcement learning (RL), etc. Existing methods either do not consider the entire time traffic, or have too high computational complexity. In this paper, the live advertising has high requirements for real-time bidding (second-level control) and faces the difficulty of unknown future traffic. Therefore, we propose a lightweight bidding algorithm Binary Constrained Bidding (BiCB), which neatly combines the optimal bidding formula given by mathematical analysis and the statistical method of future traffic estimation, and obtains good approximation to the optimal result through a low complexity solution. In addition, we complement the form of upper and lower bound constraints for traditional auto-bidding modeling and give theoretical analysis of BiCB. Sufficient offline and online experiments prove BiCB's good performance and low engineering cost.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Backtracking for Privacy Protection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preservation of privacy has emerged as a critical topic in the era of artificial intelligence. However, current work focuses on user-oriented privacy, overlooking severe enterprise data leakage risks exacerbated by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation paradigm. To address this gap, our paper introduces a novel objective: enterprise-oriented privacy concerns. Achieving this objective requires overcoming two fundamental challenges: existing methods such as data sanitization severely degrade model performance, and the field lacks public datasets for evaluation. We address these challenges with several solutions. (1) To prevent performance degradation, we propose ABack, a training-free mechanism that leverages a Hidden State Model to pinpoint the origin of a leakage intention and rewrite the output safely. (2) To solve the lack of datasets, we construct PriGenQA, a new benchmark for enterprise privacy scenarios in healthcare and finance. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we move beyond simple static attacks by developing a powerful adaptive attacker with Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experiments show that against this superior adversary, ABack improves the overall privacy utility score by up to 15\% over strong baselines, avoiding the performance trade-offs of prior methods.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Graph Representation of fMRI Data for Cognitive Brain State Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and classifying human cognitive brain states based on neuroimaging data remains one of the foremost and most challenging problems in neuroscience, owing to the high dimensionality and intrinsic noise of the signals. In this work, we propose an ensemble-based graph representation method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for the task of binary brain-state classification. Our method builds the graph by leveraging multiple base machine-learning models: each edge weight reflects the difference in posterior probabilities between two cognitive states, yielding values in the range [-1, 1] that encode confidence in a given state. We applied this approach to seven cognitive tasks from the Human Connectome Project (HCP 1200 Subject Release), including working memory, gambling, motor activity, language, social cognition, relational processing, and emotion processing. Using only the mean incident edge weights of the graphs as features, a simple logistic-regression classifier achieved average accuracies from 97.07% to 99.74%. We also compared our ensemble graphs with classical correlation-based graphs in a classification task with a graph neural network (GNN). In all experiments, the highest classification accuracy was obtained with ensemble graphs. These results demonstrate that ensemble graphs convey richer topological information and enhance brain-state discrimination. Our approach preserves edge-level interpretability of the fMRI graph representation, is adaptable to multiclass and regression tasks, and can be extended to other neuroimaging modalities and pathological-state classification.</description>

      <title>IOCC: Aligning Semantic and Cluster Centers for Few-shot Short Text Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clustering tasks, it is essential to structure the feature space into clear, well-separated distributions. However, because short text representations have limited expressiveness, conventional methods struggle to identify cluster centers that truly capture each category's underlying semantics, causing the representations to be optimized in suboptimal directions. To address this issue, we propose IOCC, a novel few-shot contrastive learning method that achieves alignment between the cluster centers and the semantic centers. IOCC consists of two key modules: Interaction-enhanced Optimal Transport (IEOT) and Center-aware Contrastive Learning (CACL). Specifically, IEOT incorporates semantic interactions between individual samples into the conventional optimal transport problem, and generate pseudo-labels. Based on these pseudo-labels, we aggregate high-confidence samples to construct pseudo-centers that approximate the semantic centers. Next, CACL optimizes text representations toward their corresponding pseudo-centers. As training progresses, the collaboration between the two modules gradually reduces the gap between cluster centers and semantic centers. Therefore, the model will learn a high-quality distribution, improving clustering performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show that IOCC outperforms previous methods, achieving up to 7.34\% improvement on challenging Biomedical dataset and also excelling in clustering stability and efficiency. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IOCC-C438.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Scalability of Classical Surrogates for Real-World Quantum Machine Learning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) presents potential for early industrial adoption, yet limited access to quantum hardware remains a significant bottleneck for deployment of QML solutions. This work explores the use of classical surrogates to bypass this restriction, which is a technique that allows to build a lightweight classical representation of a (trained) quantum model, enabling to perform inference on entirely classical devices. We reveal prohibiting high computational demand associated with previously proposed methods for generating classical surrogates from quantum models, and propose an alternative pipeline enabling generation of classical surrogates at a larger scale than was previously possible. Previous methods required at least a high-performance computing (HPC) system for quantum models of below industrial scale (ca. 20 qubits), which raises questions about its practicality. We greatly minimize the redundancies of the previous approach, utilizing only a minute fraction of the resources previously needed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a real-world energy demand forecasting problem, conducting rigorous testing of performance and computation demand in both simulations and on quantum hardware. Our results indicate that our method achieves high accuracy on the testing dataset while its computational resource requirements scale linearly rather than exponentially. This work presents a lightweight approach to transform quantum solutions into classically deployable versions, facilitating faster integration of quantum technology in industrial settings. Furthermore, it can serve as a powerful research tool in search practical quantum advantage in an empirical setup.</description>

      <title>LLM Serving Optimization with Variable Prefill and Decode Lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>One Size Does Not Fit All: A Distribution-Aware Sparsification for More Precise Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single, powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference. However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy, applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop} (\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser, more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8 ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a new baseline for high-performance model merging.</description>

      <title>Classification is a RAG problem: A case study on hate speech detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.</description>

Abstract: The goal of inductive logic programming is to search for a hypothesis that generalises training data and background knowledge. The challenge is searching vast hypothesis spaces, which is exacerbated because many logically equivalent hypotheses exist. To address this challenge, we introduce a method to break symmetries in the hypothesis space. We implement our idea in answer set programming. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can reduce solving times from over an hour to just 17 seconds.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Data Generation for Enhanced Intent Recognition in German Speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial intelligence (AI) assistant systems; however, most existing approaches are limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary. Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition. Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.</description>

We introduce PRISM Eval Behavior Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing emotional signals in speech has a significant impact on enhancing the effectiveness of human-computer interaction (HCI). This study introduces EmoAugNet, a hybrid deep learning framework, that incorporates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers with one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) to enable reliable Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). The quality and variety of the features that are taken from speech signals have a significant impact on how well SER systems perform. A comprehensive speech data augmentation strategy was used to combine both traditional methods, such as noise addition, pitch shifting, and time stretching, with a novel combination-based augmentation pipeline to enhance generalization and reduce overfitting. Each audio sample was transformed into a high-dimensional feature vector using root mean square energy (RMSE), Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), and zero-crossing rate (ZCR). Our model with ReLU activation has a weighted accuracy of 95.78\% and unweighted accuracy of 92.52\% on the IEMOCAP dataset and, with ELU activation, has a weighted accuracy of 96.75\% and unweighted accuracy of 91.28\%. On the RAVDESS dataset, we get a weighted accuracy of 94.53\% and 94.98\% unweighted accuracy for ReLU activation and 93.72\% weighted accuracy and 94.64\% unweighted accuracy for ELU activation. These results highlight EmoAugNet's effectiveness in improving the robustness and performance of SER systems through integated data augmentation and hybrid modeling.</description>

      <title>Decorrelated feature importance from local sample weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature importance (FI) statistics provide a prominent and valuable method of insight into the decision process of machine learning (ML) models, but their effectiveness has well-known limitations when correlation is present among the features in the training data. In this case, the FI often tends to be distributed among all features which are in correlation with the response-generating signal features. Even worse, if multiple signal features are in strong correlation with a noise feature, while being only modestly correlated with one another, this can result in a noise feature having a distinctly larger FI score than any signal feature. Here we propose local sample weighting (losaw) which can flexibly be integrated into many ML algorithms to improve FI scores in the presence of feature correlation in the training data. Our approach is motivated from inverse probability weighting in causal inference and locally, within the ML model, uses a sample weighting scheme to decorrelate a target feature from the remaining features. This reduces model bias locally, whenever the effect of a potential signal feature is evaluated and compared to others. Moreover, losaw comes with a natural tuning parameter, the minimum effective sample size of the weighted population, which corresponds to an interpretation-prediction-tradeoff, analog to a bias-variance-tradeoff as for classical ML tuning parameters. We demonstrate how losaw can be integrated within decision tree-based ML methods and within mini-batch training of neural networks. We investigate losaw for random forest and convolutional neural networks in a simulation study on settings showing diverse correlation patterns. We found that losaw improves FI consistently. Moreover, it often improves prediction accuracy for out-of-distribution, while maintaining a similar accuracy for in-distribution test data.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Adaptive Topology Representations for Zero-Shot Graph Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown generalized zero-shot capabilities in diverse domain question-answering (QA) tasks, including graph QA that involves complex graph topologies. However, most current approaches use only a single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF), such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those "one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses. To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency (GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific, DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from $F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7 in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms of accuracy</description>

      <title>DP-SPRT: Differentially Private Sequential Probability Ratio Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Wald's celebrated Sequential Probability Ratio Test for sequential tests of two simple hypotheses, under privacy constraints. We propose DP-SPRT, a wrapper that can be calibrated to achieve desired error probabilities and privacy constraints, addressing a significant gap in previous work. DP-SPRT relies on a private mechanism that processes a sequence of queries and stops after privately determining when the query results fall outside a predefined interval. This OutsideInterval mechanism improves upon naive composition of existing techniques like AboveThreshold, potentially benefiting other sequential algorithms. We prove generic upper bounds on the error and sample complexity of DP-SPRT that can accommodate various noise distributions based on the practitioner's privacy needs. We exemplify them in two settings: Laplace noise (pure Differential Privacy) and Gaussian noise (R\'enyi differential privacy). In the former setting, by providing a lower bound on the sample complexity of any $\epsilon$-DP test with prescribed type I and type II errors, we show that DP-SPRT is near optimal when both errors are small and the two hypotheses are close. Moreover, we conduct an experimental study revealing its good practical performance.</description>

      <title>Tree-Based Deep Learning for Ranking Symbolic Integration Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic indefinite integration in Computer Algebra Systems such as Maple involves selecting the most effective algorithm from multiple available methods. Not all methods will succeed for a given problem, and when several do, the results, though mathematically equivalent, can differ greatly in presentation complexity. Traditionally, this choice has been made with minimal consideration of the problem instance, leading to inefficiencies.
  We present a machine learning (ML) approach using tree-based deep learning models within a two-stage architecture: first identifying applicable methods for a given instance, then ranking them by predicted output complexity. Furthermore, we find representing mathematical expressions as tree structures significantly improves performance over sequence-based representations, and our two-stage framework outperforms alternative ML formulations.
  Using a diverse dataset generated by six distinct data generators, our models achieve nearly 90% accuracy in selecting the optimal method on a 70,000 example holdout test set. On an independent out-of-distribution benchmark from Maple's internal test suite, our tree transformer model maintains strong generalisation, outperforming Maple's built-in selector and prior ML approaches.
  These results highlight the critical role of data representation and problem framing in ML for symbolic computation, and we expect our methodology to generalise effectively to similar optimisation problems in mathematical software.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain-enabled federated learning (BCFL) addresses fundamental challenges of trust, privacy, and coordination in collaborative AI systems. This chapter provides comprehensive architectural analysis of BCFL systems through a systematic four-dimensional taxonomy examining coordination structures, consensus mechanisms, storage architectures, and trust models. We analyze design patterns from blockchain-verified centralized coordination to fully decentralized peer-to-peer networks, evaluating trade-offs in scalability, security, and performance. Through detailed examination of consensus mechanisms designed for federated learning contexts, including Proof of Quality and Proof of Federated Learning, we demonstrate how computational work can be repurposed from arbitrary cryptographic puzzles to productive machine learning tasks. The chapter addresses critical storage challenges by examining multi-tier architectures that balance blockchain's transaction constraints with neural networks' large parameter requirements while maintaining cryptographic integrity. A technical case study of the TrustMesh framework illustrates practical implementation considerations in BCFL systems through distributed image classification training, demonstrating effective collaborative learning across IoT devices with highly non-IID data distributions while maintaining complete transparency and fault tolerance. Analysis of real-world deployments across healthcare consortiums, financial services, and IoT security applications validates the practical viability of BCFL systems, achieving performance comparable to centralized approaches while providing enhanced security guarantees and enabling new models of trustless collaborative intelligence.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Characterization and Pathway Modeling for Catastrophic AI Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although discourse around the risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown, it often lacks a comprehensive, multidimensional framework, and concrete causal pathways mapping hazard to harm. This paper aims to bridge this gap by examining six commonly discussed AI catastrophic risks: CBRN, cyber offense, sudden loss of control, gradual loss of control, environmental risk, and geopolitical risk. First, we characterize these risks across seven key dimensions, namely intent, competency, entity, polarity, linearity, reach, and order. Next, we conduct risk pathway modeling by mapping step-by-step progressions from the initial hazard to the resulting harms. The dimensional approach supports systematic risk identification and generalizable mitigation strategies, while risk pathway models help identify scenario-specific interventions. Together, these methods offer a more structured and actionable foundation for managing catastrophic AI risks across the value chain.</description>

      <title>Memp: Exploring Agent Procedural Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory. Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a weaker model yields substantial performance gains.</description>

      <title>eSASRec: Enhancing Transformer-based Recommendations in a Modular Fashion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since their introduction, Transformer-based models, such as SASRec and BERT4Rec, have become common baselines for sequential recommendations, surpassing earlier neural and non-neural methods. A number of following publications have shown that the effectiveness of these models can be improved by, for example, slightly updating the architecture of the Transformer layers, using better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions. However, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been systematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper. Through our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's training objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call this combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on realistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that common academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to the most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece. In our main production-like benchmark, eSASRec resides on the Pareto frontier in terms of the accuracy-coverage tradeoff (alongside the recent industrial models HSTU and FuXi. As the modifications compared to the original SASRec are relatively straightforward and no extra features are needed (such as timestamps in HSTU), we believe that eSASRec can be easily integrated into existing recommendation pipelines and can can serve as a strong yet very simple baseline for emerging complicated algorithms. To facilitate this, we provide the open-source implementations for our models and benchmarks in repository https://github.com/blondered/transformer_benchmark</description>

      <title>TRUST: Leveraging Text Robustness for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process, exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Maximum Impact with Fewer Features: Efficient Feature Selection for Cold-Start Recommenders through Collaborative Importance Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold-start challenges in recommender systems necessitate leveraging auxiliary features beyond user-item interactions. However, the presence of irrelevant or noisy features can degrade predictive performance, whereas an excessive number of features increases computational demands, leading to higher memory consumption and prolonged training times.
  To address this, we propose a feature selection strategy that prioritizes the user behavioral information. Our method enhances the feature representation by incorporating correlations from collaborative behavior data using a hybrid matrix factorization technique and then ranks features using a mechanism based on the maximum volume algorithm. This approach identifies the most influential features, striking a balance between recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency. We conduct an extensive evaluation across various datasets and hybrid recommendation models, demonstrating that our method excels in cold-start scenarios by selecting minimal yet highly effective feature subsets. Even under strict feature reduction, our approach surpasses existing feature selection techniques while maintaining superior efficiency.</description>

      <title>Intuition emerges in Maximum Caliber models at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by adapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work shows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused, cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation methods.</description>

      <title>WGAST: Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m Land Surface Temperature Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33 ground-based sensors. The code is available at https://github.com/Sofianebouaziz1/WGAST.git.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the multivariate fields of experts, a new framework for the learning of image priors. Our model generalizes existing fields of experts methods by incorporating multivariate potential functions constructed via Moreau envelopes of the $\ell_\infty$-norm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal across a range of inverse problems that include image denoising, deblurring, compressed-sensing magnetic-resonance imaging, and computed tomography. The proposed approach outperforms comparable univariate models and achieves performance close to that of deep-learning-based regularizers while being significantly faster, requiring fewer parameters, and being trained on substantially fewer data. In addition, our model retains a relatively high level of interpretability due to its structured design.</description>

      <title>From research to clinic: Accelerating the translation of clinical decision support systems by making synthetic data interoperable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The translation of clinical decision support system (CDSS) tools from research settings into the clinic is often non-existent, partly because the focus tends to be on training machine learning models rather than tool development using the model for inference. To develop a CDSS tool that can be deployed in the clinical workflow, there is a need to integrate, validate, and test the tool on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems that store and manage patient data. Not surprisingly, it is rarely possible for researchers to get the necessary access to an EHR system due to legal restrictions pertaining to the protection of data privacy in patient records. We propose an architecture for using synthetic data in EHR systems to make CDSS tool development and testing much easier. In this study, the architecture is implemented in the SyntHIR system. SyntHIR has three noteworthy architectural features enabling (i) integration with synthetic data generators, (ii) data interoperability, and (iii) tool transportability. The translational value of this approach was evaluated through two primary steps. First, a working proof-of-concept of a machine learning-based CDSS tool was developed using data from patient registries in Norway. Second, the transportability of this CDSS tool was demonstrated by successfully deploying it in Norway's largest EHR system vendor (DIPS). These findings showcase the value of the SyntHIR architecture as a useful reference model to accelerate the translation of "bench to bedside" research of CDSS tools.</description>

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) biosensors, in particular those based on inter-digitated capacitors (IDCs), are pivotal in areas like biomedical diagnosis, remote sensing, and wireless communication. Despite their advantages of low cost and easy fabrication, their sensitivity can be hindered by design imperfections, environmental factors, and circuit noise. This paper investigates enhancing the sensitivity of IDC-based RF sensors using novel reinforcement learning based Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (RLBPSO), and it is compared to Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and other state-of-the-art methods. By focusing on optimizing design parameters like electrode design and finger width, the proposed study found notable improvements in sensor sensitivity. The proposed RLBPSO method shows best optimized design for various frequency ranges when compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Markov Random Field model for Hypergraph-based Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Understanding the data-generating process is essential for building machine learning models that generalise well while ensuring robustness and interpretability. This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of modelling the data generation processes on hypergraphs and explores how such models can inform the design of machine learning algorithms for hypergraph data. The key to our approach is the development of a hypergraph Markov random field that models the joint distribution of the node features and hyperedge features in a hypergraph through a multivariate Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix is uniquely determined by the hypergraph structure. The proposed data-generating process provides a valuable inductive bias for various hypergraph machine learning tasks, thus enhancing the algorithm design. In this paper, we focus on two representative downstream tasks: structure inference and node classification. Accordingly, we introduce two novel frameworks: 1) an original hypergraph structure inference framework named HGSI, and 2) a novel learning framework entitled Hypergraph-MLP for node classification on hypergraphs. Empirical evaluation of the proposed frameworks demonstrates that: 1) HGSI outperforms existing hypergraph structure inference methods on both synthetic and real-world data; and 2) Hypergraph-MLP outperforms baselines in six hypergraph node classification benchmarks, at the same time promoting runtime efficiency and robustness against structural perturbations during inference.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Gaussian Process ODEs via Double Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Gaussian processes have been used to model the vector field of continuous dynamical systems, referred to as GPODEs, which are characterized by a probabilistic ODE equation. Bayesian inference for these models has been extensively studied and applied in tasks such as time series prediction. However, the use of standard GPs with basic kernels like squared exponential kernels has been common in GPODE research, limiting the model's ability to represent complex scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce normalizing flows to reparameterize the ODE vector field, resulting in a data-driven prior distribution, thereby increasing flexibility and expressive power. We develop a data-driven variational learning algorithm that utilizes analytically tractable probability density functions of normalizing flows, enabling simultaneous learning and inference of unknown continuous dynamics. Additionally, we also apply normalizing flows to the posterior inference of GP ODEs to resolve the issue of strong mean-field assumptions in posterior inference. By applying normalizing flows in both these ways, our model improves accuracy and uncertainty estimates for Bayesian Gaussian Process ODEs. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated dynamical systems and real-world human motion data, including time series prediction and missing data recovery tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed method effectively captures model uncertainty while improving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Entropy Causal Graphs for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many multivariate time series anomaly detection frameworks have been proposed and widely applied. However, most of these frameworks do not consider intrinsic relationships between variables in multivariate time series data, thus ignoring the causal relationship among variables and degrading anomaly detection performance. This work proposes a novel framework called CGAD, an entropy Causal Graph for multivariate time series Anomaly Detection. CGAD utilizes transfer entropy to construct graph structures that unveil the underlying causal relationships among time series data. Weighted graph convolutional networks combined with causal convolutions are employed to model both the causal graph structures and the temporal patterns within multivariate time series data. Furthermore, CGAD applies anomaly scoring, leveraging median absolute deviation-based normalization to improve the robustness of the anomaly identification process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets with a 9% average improvement in terms of three different multivariate time series anomaly detection metrics.</description>

      <title>Decision-focused predictions via pessimistic bilevel optimization: complexity and algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17640v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dealing with uncertainty in optimization parameters is an important and longstanding challenge. Typically, uncertain parameters are predicted accurately, and then a deterministic optimization problem is solved. However, the decisions produced by this so-called predict-then-optimize procedure can be highly sensitive to uncertain parameters. In this work, we contribute to recent efforts in producing decision-focused predictions, i.e., to build predictive models that are constructed with the goal of minimizing a regret measure on the decisions taken with them. We begin by formulating the exact expected regret minimization as a pessimistic bilevel optimization model. Then, we show computational complexity results of this problem, including its membership in NP. In combination with a known NP-hardness result, this establishes NP-completeness and discards its hardness in higher complexity classes. Using duality arguments, we reformulate it as a non-convex quadratic optimization problem. Finally, leveraging the quadratic reformulation, we show various computational techniques to achieve empirical tractability. We report extensive computational results on shortest-path and bipartite matching instances with uncertain cost vectors. Our results indicate that our approach can improve training performance over the approach of Elmachtoub and Grigas (2022), a state-of-the-art method for decision-focused learning.</description>

      <title>Soft Dice Confidence: A Near-Optimal Confidence Estimator for Selective Prediction in Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In semantic segmentation, even state-of-the-art deep learning models fall short of the performance required in certain high-stakes applications such as medical image analysis. In these cases, performance can be improved by allowing a model to abstain from making predictions when confidence is low, an approach known as selective prediction. While well-known in the classification literature, selective prediction has been underexplored in the context of semantic segmentation. This paper tackles the problem by focusing on image-level abstention, which involves producing a single confidence estimate for the entire image, in contrast to previous approaches that focus on pixel-level uncertainty. Assuming the Dice coefficient as the evaluation metric for segmentation, two main contributions are provided in this paper: (i) In the case of known marginal posterior probabilities, we derive the optimal confidence estimator, which is observed to be intractable for typical image sizes. Then, an approximation computable in linear time, named Soft Dice Confidence (SDC), is proposed and proven to be tightly bounded to the optimal estimator. (ii) When only an estimate of the marginal posterior probabilities are known, we propose a plug-in version of the SDC and show it outperforms all previous methods, including those requiring additional tuning data. These findings are supported by experimental results on both synthetic data and real-world data from six medical imaging tasks, including out-of-distribution scenarios, positioning the SDC as a reliable and efficient tool for selective prediction in semantic segmentation.</description>

      <title>Data Collaboration Analysis with Orthonormal Basis Selection and Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02780v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data Collaboration (DC) enables multiple parties to jointly train a model without exposing their private datasets. Each party privately transforms its data using a secret linear basis and shares only the resulting intermediate representations. Existing theory asserts that any target basis spanning the same subspace as the secret bases should suffice; however, empirical evidence reveals that the particular choice of target basis significantly influences model accuracy and stability. In this paper, we introduce Orthonormal Data Collaboration (ODC), a novel DC framework that explicitly enforces orthonormality constraints on both the secret and target bases. Under these constraints, the basis alignment step reduces precisely to the classical Orthogonal Procrustes Problem, admitting a closed-form solution. We rigorously establish that the resulting orthonormal change-of-basis matrices achieve orthogonal concordance, aligning all parties' intermediate representations up to a common orthogonal transformation. Consequently, downstream model performance becomes invariant to the specific choice of orthonormal target basis. Computationally, ODC substantially reduces alignment complexity from O(\min\{a,(cl)^2,a^2cl) to O(acl^2) where a denotes anchor data size, l the latent dimension, and c the number of collaborating parties. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm the theoretical advantages of ODC, demonstrating alignment speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art DC methods, alongside comparable or superior accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. ODC maintains robust privacy under the semi-honest threat model and requires only a single round of communication. These results establish ODC as a practically advantageous and computationally efficient enhancement to existing DC pipelines, particularly when orthonormal secret bases are naturally feasible.</description>

      <title>Position: Lifetime tuning is incompatible with continual reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02113v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continual RL we want agents capable of never-ending learning, and yet our evaluation methodologies do not reflect this. The standard practice in RL is to assume unfettered access to the deployment environment for the full lifetime of the agent. For example, agent designers select the best performing hyperparameters in Atari by testing each for 200 million frames and then reporting results on 200 million frames. In this position paper, we argue and demonstrate the pitfalls of this inappropriate empirical methodology: lifetime tuning. We provide empirical evidence to support our position by testing DQN and SAC across several of continuing and non-stationary environments with two main findings: (1) lifetime tuning does not allow us to identify algorithms that work well for continual learning -- all algorithms equally succeed; (2) recently developed continual RL algorithms outperform standard non-continual algorithms when tuning is limited to a fraction of the agent's lifetime. The goal of this paper is to provide an explanation for why recent progress in continual RL has been mixed and motivate the development of empirical practices that better match the goals of continual RL.</description>

      <title>Reorganizing attention-space geometry with expressive attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attention regulates information transfer between tokens. For this, query and key vectors are compared, typically in terms of a scalar product, $\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{K}$, together with a subsequent softmax normalization. In geometric terms, the standard dot-product attention (DPA) leads to large/small attention weights for parallel/antiparallel queries and keys. Here we study expressive attention (EA), which is based on $(\mathbf{Q}^T\mathbf{K})^2$, the squared dot product. In this case, attention is enhanced when query and key are either parallel or antiparallel, and suppressed for orthogonal configurations. EA can be introduced into any attention-based code without additional compute costs or memory requirements. For a series of autoregressive prediction tasks, we find that expressive attention performs at least as well as vanilla DPA. Increasing task complexity, EA is observed to outperform DPA with increasing margins, which also holds for multi-task settings. For a given model size, EA manages to achieve 100% performance for a range of complexity levels not accessible to DPA. Our results show that it is possible to reorganize the geometry of the matching condition in the space of attention heads without loss of performance.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors are available only at some locations. The problem is challenging due to the unknown data distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise to traffic patterns. We propose a Spatio-temporal Long-term Partial sensing Forecast model (SLPF) for traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to reduce the impact of noise in data, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate its superior performance. Our source code is at https://github.com/zbliu98/SLPF</description>

      <title>Formal Local Implication Between Two Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two neural network classifiers with the same input and output domains, our goal is to compare the two networks in relation to each other over an entire input region (e.g., within a vicinity of an input sample). To this end, we establish the foundation of formal local implication between two networks, i.e., N2 implies N1, in an entire input region D. That is, network N1 consistently makes a correct decision every time network N2 does, and it does so in an entire input region D. We further propose a sound formulation for establishing such formally-verified (provably correct) local implications. The proposed formulation is relevant in the context of several application domains, e.g., for comparing a trained network and its corresponding compact (e.g., pruned, quantized, distilled) networks. We evaluate our formulation based on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and two real-world medical datasets, to show its relevance.</description>

      <title>ATM: Improving Model Merging by Alternating Tuning and Merging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03055v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a cost-efficient approximation to multitask learning. Among merging strategies, task arithmetic is notable for its simplicity and effectiveness. In this work, we provide a theoretical motivation for task vectors by highlighting that, under single-epoch full-batch gradient descent, they are equivalent to multitask gradients. This insight leads us to reinterpret model merging as a single step in an iterative procedure that Alternates between Tuning and Merging (ATM). We propose two applications of ATM: (1) as an alternative to multitask learning in scenarios where data sharing is restricted (e.g., federated settings), and (2) as a lightweight refinement step to improve existing model merging methods using a small validation set. Experiments across diverse vision tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of ATM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) for link prediction have introduced sophisticated training techniques and model architectures. However, reliance on outdated baselines may exaggerate the benefits of these new approaches. To tackle this issue, we systematically explore Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) by applying model-agnostic tricks in recent methods and tuning hyperparameters. We find that a well-tuned GAE can match the performance of recent sophisticated models while offering superior computational efficiency on widely-used link prediction benchmarks. Our approach delivers substantial performance gains on datasets where structural information dominates and feature data is limited. Specifically, our GAE achieves a state-of-the-art Hits@100 score of 78.41\% on the ogbl-ppa dataset. Furthermore, we examine the impact of various tricks to uncover the reasons behind our success and to guide the design of future methods. Our study emphasizes the critical need to update baselines for a more accurate assessment of progress in GNNs for link prediction. Our code is available at https://github.com/GraphPKU/Refined-GAE.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Collocation Point Strategies For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving forward and inverse problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). While advancements in loss functions and network architectures have improved PINN accuracy, the impact of collocation point sampling on their performance remains underexplored. Fixed sampling methods, such as uniform random sampling and equispaced grids, can fail to capture critical regions with high solution gradients, limiting their effectiveness for complex PDEs. Adaptive methods, inspired by adaptive mesh refinement from traditional numerical methods, address this by dynamically updating collocation points during training but may overlook residual dynamics between updates, potentially losing valuable information. To overcome this limitation, we propose two adaptive collocation point selection strategies utilizing the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (QR-DEIM), a reduced-order modeling technique for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions. Our results on benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our QR-DEIM-based approaches improve PINN accuracy compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for adaptive collocation point strategies.</description>

      <title>Systemizing Multiplicity: The Curious Case of Arbitrariness in Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithmic modeling relies on limited information in data to extrapolate outcomes for unseen scenarios, often embedding an element of arbitrariness in its decisions. A perspective on this arbitrariness that has recently gained interest is multiplicity-the study of arbitrariness across a set of "good models", i.e., those likely to be deployed in practice. In this work, we systemize the literature on multiplicity by: (a) formalizing the terminology around model design choices and their contribution to arbitrariness, (b) expanding the definition of multiplicity to incorporate underrepresented forms beyond just predictions and explanations, (c) clarifying the distinction between multiplicity and other lenses of arbitrariness, i.e., uncertainty and variance, and (d) distilling the benefits and potential risks of multiplicity into overarching trends, situating it within the broader landscape of responsible AI. We conclude by identifying open research questions and highlighting emerging trends in this young but rapidly growing area of research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its practical significance. Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset. Code is available: https://github.com/JiahaoChen1/Pre-train-Imbalance</description>

      <title>Contextually Entangled Gradient Mapping for Optimized LLM Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextually Entangled Gradient Mapping (CEGM) introduces a new approach to gradient optimization, redefining the relationship between contextual embeddings and gradient updates to enhance semantic coherence and reasoning capabilities in neural architectures. By treating gradients as dynamic carriers of contextual dependencies rather than isolated numerical entities, the proposed methodology bridges critical gaps in existing optimization strategies. The integration of entangled gradient dynamics into a loss regularization framework demonstrated significant improvements in tasks involving long-form reasoning, contextual retention, and adaptability to unseen domains. Experimental evaluations showed that the CEGM-enhanced model consistently outperformed baseline approaches, achieving higher accuracy in token-level predictions and greater resilience to noisy inputs. Practical implementations involved modifications to training pipelines, introducing entanglement layers and dynamic coefficient adjustments that seamlessly align with existing architectures. Results further highlighted reductions in semantic drift during sequential transformations and improvements in embedding coherence across paraphrased sentences, showing the robustness and versatility of the proposed methodology. The findings demonstrate the broader implications of gradient entanglement for both theoretical advancements and practical applications in optimization strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is a widely used method for data assimilation in high-dimensional systems, with an ensemble update step equivalent to an empirical version of the Matheron update popular in Gaussian process regression -- a connection that links half a century of data-assimilation engineering to modern path-wise GP sampling.
  This paper provides a compact introduction to this simple but under-exploited connection, with necessary definitions accessible to all fields involved.

      <title>CAMEF: Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting by Integrating Time Series Patterns and Salient Macroeconomic Announcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting the impact of macroeconomic events is critical for investors and policymakers. Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback via Information-Directed Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a critical problem in training large language models, from a theoretical perspective. Our main contribution is the design of novel sample-efficient RLHF algorithms based on information-directed sampling (IDS), an online decision-making principle inspired by information theory. Our algorithms maximize the sum of the value function and a mutual information term that encourages exploration of the unknown environment (which quantifies the information gained about the environment through observed human feedback data). To tackle the challenge of large state spaces and improve sample efficiency, we construct a simplified \emph{surrogate environment} and introduce a novel distance measure (named the \emph{$\ell_g$-distance}), enabling our IDS-based algorithm to achieve a Bayesian regret upper bound of order $O(H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{\log(K(\epsilon)) T})$, where $H$ is the episode length, $T$ is the number of episode and $K(\epsilon)$ is related to the covering number of the environment. Specializing to the tabular settings, this regret bound is of order $\tilde{O}(H^2\sqrt{SAT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions. Finally, we propose an Approximate-IDS algorithm that is computationally more efficient while maintaining nearly the same sample efficiency. The design principle of this approximate algorithm is not only effective in RLHF settings but also applicable to the standard RL framework. Moreover, our work showcases the value of information theory in reinforcement learning and in the training of large language models.</description>

      <title>DeToNATION: Decoupled Torch Network-Aware Training on Interlinked Online Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training large neural network models requires extensive computational resources, often distributed across several nodes and accelerators. Recent findings suggest that it may be sufficient to only exchange the fast moving components of the gradients, while accumulating momentum locally (Decoupled Momentum, or DeMo). However, DeMo assumes that models fit on a single accelerator. We relax this assumption and introduce FlexDeMo, whereby nodes fully shard model parameters locally between different accelerators, while inter-node communication is reduced by synchronizing only fast-moving components instead of the full gradients -- resulting in a hybrid sharded data parallel training strategy. We further introduce a framework, denoted as DeToNATION, that generalizes DeMo, FlexDeMo, and other popular distributed training schemes such as DiLoCo -- introducing new variations of replication schemes and challenging choices made in DeMo. Our results across language and vision domains show that FlexDeMo attains similar validation loss as hybrid sharded data parallel training employing AdamW and full gradient synchronization, while being substantially faster. FlexDeMo is thus a promising distributed training scheme for the largest machine learning models.</description>

      <title>CAST: Cross Attention based multimodal fusion of Structure and Text for materials property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have significantly enhanced the prediction of material properties by modeling crystal structures as graphs. However, GNNs often struggle to capture global structural characteristics, such as crystal systems, limiting their predictive performance. To overcome this issue, we propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal model that integrates graph representations with textual descriptions of materials, effectively preserving critical structural and compositional information. Unlike previous approaches, such as CrysMMNet and MultiMat, which rely on aggregated material-level embeddings, CAST leverages cross-attention mechanisms to combine fine-grained graph node-level and text token-level features. Additionally, we introduce a masked node prediction pretraining strategy that further enhances the alignment between node and text embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAST outperforms existing baseline models across four key material properties-formation energy, band gap, bulk modulus, and shear modulus-with average relative MAE improvements ranging from 10.2% to 35.7%. Analysis of attention maps confirms the importance of pretraining in effectively aligning multimodal representations. This study underscores the potential of multimodal learning frameworks for developing more accurate and globally informed predictive models in materials science.</description>

      <title>Navigating Demand Uncertainty in Container Shipping: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enabling Adaptive and Feasible Master Stowage Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12756v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we focus on using RL in container shipping, often considered the cornerstone of global trade, by dealing with the critical challenge of master stowage planning. The main objective is to maximize cargo revenue and minimize operational costs while navigating demand uncertainty and various complex operational constraints, namely vessel capacity and stability, which must be dynamically updated along the vessel's voyage. To address this problem, we implement a deep reinforcement learning framework with feasibility projection to solve the master stowage planning problem (MPP) under demand uncertainty. The experimental results show that our architecture efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions for this multi-stage stochastic optimization problem, outperforming traditional mixed-integer programming and RL with feasibility regularization. Our AI-driven decision-support policy enables adaptive and feasible planning under uncertainty, optimizing operational efficiency and capacity utilization while contributing to sustainable and resilient global supply chains.</description>

      <title>ACTIVA: Amortized Causal Effect Estimation via Transformer-based Variational Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the distribution of outcomes under hypothetical interventions is crucial across healthcare, economics, and policy-making. However, existing methods often require restrictive assumptions, and are typically limited by the lack of amortization across problem instances. We propose ACTIVA, a transformer-based conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture for amortized causal inference, which estimates interventional distributions directly from observational data without. ACTIVA learns a latent representation conditioned on observational inputs and intervention queries, enabling zero-shot inference by amortizing causal knowledge from diverse training scenarios. We provide theoretical insights showing that ACTIVA predicts interventional distributions as mixtures over observationally equivalent causal models. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness of our amortized approach and highlight promising directions for future real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability poses significant challenges for analysis and classification. To address these challenges, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework designed to capture both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers linked through skip connections, which preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. Even though identical or highly similar underlying parameters describing a system's state can lead to significant variability in graph realizations, GAUDI consistently maps them into nearby regions of a structured and continuous latent space, effectively disentangling invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate GAUDI's versatility across multiple applications, including small-world networks modeling, characterization of protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analysis of collective motion in the Vicsek model, and identification of age-related changes in brain connectivity. Comparison with related approaches highlights GAUDI's superior performance in analyzing complex graphs, providing new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Learning to Match Unpaired Data with Minimum Entropy Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal data is a precious asset enabling a variety of downstream tasks in machine learning. However, real-world data collected across different modalities is often not paired, which is a significant challenge to learn a joint distribution. A prominent approach to address the modality coupling problem is Minimum Entropy Coupling (MEC), which seeks to minimize the joint Entropy, while satisfying constraints on the marginals. Existing approaches to the MEC problem focus on finite, discrete distributions, limiting their application for cases involving continuous data. In this work, we propose a novel method to solve the continuous MEC problem, using well-known generative diffusion models that learn to approximate and minimize the joint Entropy through a cooperative scheme, while satisfying a relaxed version of the marginal constraints. We empirically demonstrate that our method, DDMEC, is general and can be easily used to address challenging tasks, including unsupervised single-cell multi-omics data alignment and unpaired image translation, outperforming specialized methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08727v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamically integrating new or rapidly evolving information after (Large) Language Model pre-training remains challenging, particularly in low-data scenarios or when dealing with private and specialized documents. In-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face limitations, including their high inference costs and their inability to capture global document information. In this paper, we propose a way of modularizing knowledge by training document-level Knowledge Modules (KMs). KMs are lightweight components implemented as parameter-efficient LoRA modules, which are trained to store information about new documents and can be easily plugged into models on demand. We show that next-token prediction performs poorly as the training objective for KMs. We instead propose Deep Context Distillation: we learn KMs parameters such as to simulate hidden states and logits of a teacher that takes the document in context. Our method outperforms standard next-token prediction and pre-instruction training techniques, across two datasets. Finally, we highlight synergies between KMs and RAG.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Designing Sparse Autoencoders by Approximating Quasi-Orthogonality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used in mechanistic interpretability research for large language models; however, the state-of-the-art method of using $k$-sparse autoencoders lacks a theoretical grounding for selecting the hyperparameter $k$ that represents the number of nonzero activations, often denoted by $\ell_0$. In this paper, we reveal a theoretical link that the $\ell_2$-norm of the sparse feature vector can be approximated with the $\ell_2$-norm of the dense vector with a closed-form error, which allows sparse autoencoders to be trained without the need to manually determine $\ell_0$. Specifically, we validate two applications of our theoretical findings. First, we introduce a new methodology that can assess the feature activations of pre-trained SAEs by computing the theoretically expected value from the input embedding, which has been overlooked by existing SAE evaluation methods and loss functions. Second, we introduce a novel activation function, top-AFA, which builds upon our formulation of approximate feature activation (AFA). This function enables top-$k$ style activation without requiring a constant hyperparameter $k$ to be tuned, dynamically determining the number of activated features for each input. By training SAEs on three intermediate layers to reconstruct GPT2 hidden embeddings for over 80 million tokens from the OpenWebText dataset, we demonstrate the empirical merits of this approach and compare it with current state-of-the-art $k$-sparse autoencoders.

      <title>Echo Chamber: RL Post-training Amplifies Behaviors Learned in Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has become a crucial step in post-training language models for advanced mathematical reasoning and coding. Following the success of frontier reasoning models, recent work has demonstrated that RL fine-tuning consistently improves performance, even in smaller-scale models; however, the underlying mechanisms driving these improvements are not well-understood. Understanding the effects of RL fine-tuning requires disentangling its interaction with pretraining data composition, hyperparameters, and model scale, but such problems are exacerbated by the lack of transparency regarding the training data used in many existing models. In this work, we present a systematic end-to-end study of RL fine-tuning for mathematical reasoning by training models entirely from scratch on different mixtures of fully open datasets. We investigate the effects of various RL fine-tuning algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and Expert Iteration) across models of different scales. Our study reveals that RL algorithms consistently converge towards a dominant output distribution, amplifying patterns in the pretraining data. We also find that models of different scales trained on the same data mixture will converge to distinct output distributions, suggesting that there are scale-dependent biases in model generalization. Moreover, we find that RL post-training on simpler questions can lead to performance gains on harder ones, indicating that certain reasoning capabilities generalize across tasks. Our findings show that small-scale proxies in controlled settings can elicit interesting insights regarding the role of RL in shaping language model behavior.</description>

      <title>On the Value of Cross-Modal Misalignment in Multimodal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10143v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal representation learning, exemplified by multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) using image-text pairs, aims to learn powerful representations by aligning cues across modalities. This approach relies on the core assumption that the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an identical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world datasets often exhibit cross-modal misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize cross-modal misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: Selection bias, where some semantic variables are absent in the text, and perturbation bias, where semantic variables are altered -- both leading to misalignment in data pairs. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical findings via extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real image-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of cross-modal misalignment on multimodal representation learning.</description>

      <title>iTFKAN: Interpretable Time Series Forecasting with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As time evolves, data within specific domains exhibit predictability that motivates time series forecasting to predict future trends from historical data. However, current deep forecasting methods can achieve promising performance but generally lack interpretability, hindering trustworthiness and practical deployment in safety-critical applications such as auto-driving and healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model, iTFKAN, for credible time series forecasting. iTFKAN enables further exploration of model decision rationales and underlying data patterns due to its interpretability achieved through model symbolization. Besides, iTFKAN develops two strategies, prior knowledge injection, and time-frequency synergy learning, to effectively guide model learning under complex intertwined time series data. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that iTFKAN can achieve promising forecasting performance while simultaneously possessing high interpretive capabilities.</description>

      <title>SMOGAN: Synthetic Minority Oversampling with GAN Refinement for Imbalanced Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imbalanced regression refers to prediction tasks where the target variable is skewed. This skewness hinders machine learning models, especially neural networks, which concentrate on dense regions and therefore perform poorly on underrepresented (minority) samples. Despite the importance of this problem, only a few methods have been proposed for imbalanced regression. Many of the available solutions for imbalanced regression adapt techniques from the class imbalance domain, such as linear interpolation and the addition of Gaussian noise, to create synthetic data in sparse regions. However, in many cases, the underlying distribution of the data is complex and non-linear. Consequently, these approaches generate synthetic samples that do not accurately represent the true feature-target relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose SMOGAN, a two-step oversampling framework for imbalanced regression. In Stage 1, an existing oversampler generates initial synthetic samples in sparse target regions. In Stage 2, we introduce DistGAN, a distribution-aware GAN that serves as SMOGAN's filtering layer and refines these samples via adversarial loss augmented with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy objective, aligning them with the true joint feature-target distribution. Extensive experiments on 23 imbalanced datasets show that SMOGAN consistently outperforms the default oversampling method without the DistGAN filtering layer.</description>

      <title>Khan-GCL: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Based Graph Contrastive Learning with Hard Negatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has demonstrated great promise for learning generalizable graph representations from unlabeled data. However, conventional GCL approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the restricted expressive capacity of multilayer perceptron (MLP) based encoders, and (2) suboptimal negative samples that either from random augmentations-failing to provide effective 'hard negatives'-or generated hard negatives without addressing the semantic distinctions crucial for discriminating graph data. To this end, we propose Khan-GCL, a novel framework that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into the GCL encoder architecture, substantially enhancing its representational capacity. Furthermore, we exploit the rich information embedded within KAN coefficient parameters to develop two novel critical feature identification techniques that enable the generation of semantically meaningful hard negative samples for each graph representation. These strategically constructed hard negatives guide the encoder to learn more discriminative features by emphasizing critical semantic differences between graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing GCL methods across a variety of datasets and tasks.</description>

      <title>VerificAgent: Domain-Specific Memory Verification for Scalable Oversight of Aligned Computer-Use Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual memory augmentation lets computer-using agents (CUAs) learn from prior interactions, but unvetted memories can encode domain-inappropriate or unsafe heuristics--spurious rules that drift from user intent and safety constraints. We introduce VerificAgent, a scalable oversight framework that treats persistent memory as an explicit alignment surface. VerificAgent combines (1) an expert-curated seed of domain knowledge, (2) iterative, trajectory-based memory growth during training, and (3) a post-hoc human fact-checking pass to sanitize accumulated memories before deployment. Evaluated on OSWorld productivity tasks and additional adversarial stress tests, VerificAgent improves task reliability, reduces hallucination-induced failures, and preserves interpretable, auditable guidance--without additional model fine-tuning. By letting humans correct high-impact errors once, the verified memory acts as a frozen safety contract that future agent actions must satisfy. Our results suggest that domain-scoped, human-verified memory offers a scalable oversight mechanism for CUAs, complementing broader alignment strategies by limiting silent policy drift and anchoring agent behavior to the norms and safety constraints of the target domain.</description>

      <title>Fusing Cross-Domain Knowledge from Multimodal Data to Solve Problems in the Physical World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence has enabled a diversity of applications that bridge the gap between digital and physical worlds. As physical environments are too complex to model through a single information acquisition approach, it is crucial to fuse multimodal data generated by different sources, such as sensors, devices, systems, and people, to solve a problem in the real world. Unfortunately, it is neither applicable nor sustainable to deploy new resources to collect original data from scratch for every problem. Thus, when data is inadequate in the domain of problem, it is vital to fuse knowledge from multimodal data that is already available in other domains. We call this cross-domain knowledge fusion. Existing research focus on fusing multimodal data in a single domain, supposing the knowledge from different datasets is intrinsically aligned; however, this assumption may not hold in the scenarios of cross-domain knowledge fusion. In this paper, we formally define the cross-domain multimodal data fusion problem, discussing its unique challenges, differences and advantages beyond data fusion in a single domain. We propose a four-layer framework, consisting of Domains, Links, Models and Data layers, answering three key questions:"what to fuse", "why can be fused", and "how to fuse". The Domains Layer selects relevant data from different domains for a given problem. The Links Layer reveals the philosophy of knowledge alignment beyond specific model structures. The Models Layer provides two knowledge fusion paradigms based on the fundamental mechanisms for processing data. The Data Layer turns data of different structures, resolutions, scales and distributions into a consistent representation that can be fed into an AI model. With this framework, we can design solutions that fuse cross-domain multimodal data effectively for solving real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN): Discovering Hidden Relationships in the Carbon Cycle and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how carbon flows through the soil is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change. While soils have potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, the soil carbon cycle remains poorly understood. Scientists have developed mathematical process-based models of the soil carbon cycle based on existing knowledge, but they contain numerous unknown parameters that must be set in an ad-hoc manner, and often fit observations poorly. On the other hand, neural networks can learn patterns from data, but do not respect known scientific laws, nor can they reveal novel scientific relationships due to their black-box nature. We thus propose Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN), a fully-transparent framework that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning. An interpretable encoder predicts scientifically-meaningful latent parameters, which are then passed through a differentiable process-based decoder to predict labeled output variables. ScIReN leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to ensure the encoder is fully interpretable and reveals relationships between input features and latent parameters; it uses novel smoothness penalties to balance expressivity and simplicity. ScIReN also uses a novel hard-sigmoid constraint layer to restrict latent parameters to meaningful ranges defined by scientific prior knowledge. While the process-based decoder enforces established scientific knowledge, the KAN-based encoder reveals new scientific relationships hidden in conventional black-box models. We apply ScIReN on two tasks: simulating the flow of organic carbon through soils, and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants. In both tasks, ScIReN outperforms black-box networks in predictive accuracy while providing substantial scientific interpretability -- it can infer latent scientific mechanisms and their relationships with input features.</description>

      <title>Time-Prompt: Integrated Heterogeneous Prompts for Unlocking LLMs in Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Quality over Quantity: An Effective Large-Scale Data Reduction Strategy Based on Pointwise V-Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to increase the effectiveness of model training, data reduction is essential to data-centric Artificial Intelligence (AI). It achieves this by locating the most instructive examples in massive datasets. To increase data quality and training efficiency, the main difficulty is choosing the best examples rather than the complete datasets. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy based on Pointwise V-Information (PVI). To enable a static method, we first use PVI to quantify instance difficulty and remove instances with low difficulty. Experiments show that classifier performance is maintained with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% decline in accuracy when 10%-30% of the data is removed. Second, we train the classifiers using a progressive learning strategy on examples sorted by increasing PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy gain over conventional training. Our findings imply that training a classifier on the chosen optimal subset may improve model performance and increase training efficiency when combined with an efficient data reduction strategy. Furthermore, we have adapted the PVI framework, which was previously limited to English datasets, to a variety of Chinese Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and base models, yielding insightful results for faster training and cross-lingual data reduction.</description>

      <title>A Graph Sufficiency Perspective for Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes neural networks through graph variables and statistical sufficiency. We interpret neural network layers as graph-based transformations, where neurons act as pairwise functions between inputs and learned anchor points. Within this formulation, we establish conditions under which layer outputs are sufficient for the layer inputs, that is, each layer preserves the conditional distribution of the target variable given the input variable. We explore two theoretical paths under this graph-based view. The first path assumes dense anchor points and shows that asymptotic sufficiency holds in the infinite-width limit and is preserved throughout training. The second path, more aligned with practical architectures, proves exact or approximate sufficiency in finite-width networks by assuming region-separated input distributions and constructing appropriate anchor points. This path can ensure the sufficiency property for an infinite number of layers, and provide error bounds on the optimal loss for both regression and classification tasks using standard neural networks. Our framework covers fully connected layers, general pairwise functions, ReLU and sigmoid activations, and convolutional neural networks. Overall, this work bridges statistical sufficiency, graph-theoretic representations, and deep learning, providing a new statistical understanding of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Causal Mechanism Estimation in Multi-Sensor Systems Across Multiple Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation (CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.</description>

      <title>RANA: Robust Active Learning for Noisy Network Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network alignment has attracted widespread attention in various fields. However, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity, while overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can substantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes structural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced and process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust Active learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles both structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor link annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models. Specifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the Label Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise, respectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization objective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address structural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion denoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide more accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active learning-based methods in alignment accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/YXNan0110/RANA.</description>

      <title>Adacc: An Adaptive Framework Unifying Compression and Activation Recomputation for LLM Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by GPU memory limitations. To alleviate memory pressure, activation recomputation and data compression have been proposed as two major strategies. However, both approaches have limitations: recomputation introduces significant training overhead, while compression can lead to accuracy degradation and computational inefficiency when applied naively. In this paper, we propose Adacc, the first adaptive memory optimization framework that unifies activation recomputation and data compression to improve training efficiency for LLMs while preserving model accuracy. Unlike existing methods that apply static, rule-based strategies or rely solely on one technique, Adacc makes fine-grained, tensor-level decisions, dynamically selecting between recomputation, retention, and compression based on tensor characteristics and runtime hardware constraints.
  Adacc tackles three key challenges: (1) it introduces layer-specific compression algorithms that mitigate accuracy loss by accounting for outliers in LLM activations; (2) it employs a MILP-based scheduling policy to globally optimize memory strategies across layers; and (3) it integrates an adaptive policy evolution mechanism to update strategies during training in response to changing data distributions. Experimental results show that Adacc improves training throughput by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues. We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k &lt;&lt; n, while maintaining high accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Automatic Software Vulnerability Assessment via Knowledge Distillation and Particle Swarm Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by 34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.</description>

      <title>HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB). Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations, and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Sampling of Extreme-Scale Turbulence Datasets for Accurate and Efficient Spatiotemporal Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, efficient training increasingly requires rethinking data volume. Can we train better models with significantly less data via intelligent subsampling? To explore this, we develop SICKLE, a sparse intelligent curation framework for efficient learning, featuring a novel maximum entropy (MaxEnt) sampling approach, scalable training, and energy benchmarking. We compare MaxEnt with random and phase-space sampling on large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of turbulence. Evaluating SICKLE at scale on Frontier, we show that subsampling as a preprocessing step can improve model accuracy and substantially lower energy consumption, with reductions of up to 38x observed in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Federated Continual Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec) methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.</description>

      <title>Exploring Superior Function Calls via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to benefit the community.</description>

      <title>X-VFL: A New Vertical Federated Learning Framework with Cross Completion and Decision Subspace Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However, VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii) the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client). To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and locally independent inference.</description>

      <title>MESAHA-Net: Multi-Encoders based Self-Adaptive Hard Attention Network with Maximum Intensity Projections for Lung Nodule Segmentation in CT Scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate lung nodule segmentation is crucial for early-stage lung cancer diagnosis, as it can substantially enhance patient survival rates. Computed tomography (CT) images are widely employed for early diagnosis in lung nodule analysis. However, the heterogeneity of lung nodules, size diversity, and the complexity of the surrounding environment pose challenges for developing robust nodule segmentation methods. In this study, we propose an efficient end-to-end framework, the multi-encoder-based self-adaptive hard attention network (MESAHA-Net), for precise lung nodule segmentation in CT scans. MESAHA-Net comprises three encoding paths, an attention block, and a decoder block, facilitating the integration of three types of inputs: CT slice patches, forward and backward maximum intensity projection (MIP) images, and region of interest (ROI) masks encompassing the nodule. By employing a novel adaptive hard attention mechanism, MESAHA-Net iteratively performs slice-by-slice 2D segmentation of lung nodules, focusing on the nodule region in each slice to generate 3D volumetric segmentation of lung nodules. The proposed framework has been comprehensively evaluated on the LIDC-IDRI dataset, the largest publicly available dataset for lung nodule segmentation. The results demonstrate that our approach is highly robust for various lung nodule types, outperforming previous state-of-the-art techniques in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational complexity, rendering it suitable for real-time clinical implementation.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bound for Diffusion Models using Random Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have been successfully used to generate data from noise. However, most diffusion models are computationally expensive and difficult to interpret with a lack of theoretical justification. Random feature models on the other hand have gained popularity due to their interpretability but their application to complex machine learning tasks remains limited. In this work, we present a diffusion model-inspired deep random feature model that is interpretable and gives comparable numerical results to a fully connected neural network having the same number of trainable parameters. Specifically, we extend existing results for random features and derive generalization bounds between the distribution of sampled data and the true distribution using properties of score matching. We validate our findings by generating samples on the fashion MNIST dataset and instrumental audio data.</description>

      <title>Improved DDIM Sampling with Moment Matching Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04938v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as reverse transition operator (kernel) within the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) framework, which is one of the most widely used approaches for accelerated sampling from pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Specifically we match the first and second order central moments of the DDPM forward marginals by constraining the parameters of the GMM. We see that moment matching is sufficient to obtain samples with equal or better quality than the original DDIM with Gaussian kernels. We provide experimental results with unconditional models trained on CelebAHQ and FFHQ, class-conditional models trained on ImageNet, and text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion v2.1 on COYO700M datasets respectively. Our results suggest that using the GMM kernel leads to significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples when the number of sampling steps is small, as measured by FID and IS metrics. For example on ImageNet 256x256, using 10 sampling steps, we achieve a FID of 6.94 and IS of 207.85 with a GMM kernel compared to 10.15 and 196.73 respectively with a Gaussian kernel. Further, we derive novel SDE samplers for rectified flow matching models and experiment with the proposed approach. We see improvements using both 1-rectified flow and 2-rectified flow models.</description>

Abstract: Multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) data facilitate the early diagnosis, tumor segmentation, and disease staging in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The lack of publicly available, comprehensive datasets limits advancements in diagnosis, treatment planning, and the development of machine learning algorithms for NPC. Addressing this critical need, we introduce the first comprehensive NPC MRI dataset, encompassing MR axial imaging of 277 primary NPC patients. This dataset includes T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences, totaling 831 scans. In addition to the corresponding clinical data, manually annotated and labeled segmentations by experienced radiologists offer high-quality data resources from untreated primary NPC.</description>

      <title>INS-MMBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating LVLMs' Performance in Insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various general multimodal applications and have shown increasing promise in specialized domains. However, their potential in the insurance domain-characterized by diverse application scenarios and rich multimodal data-remains largely underexplored. To date, there is no systematic review of multimodal tasks, nor a benchmark specifically designed to assess the capabilities of LVLMs in insurance. This gap hinders the development of LVLMs within the insurance industry. This study systematically reviews and categorizes multimodal tasks for 4 representative types of insurance: auto, property, health, and agricultural. We introduce INS-MMBench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for the insurance domain. INS-MMBench encompasses 22 fundamental tasks, 12 meta-tasks and 5 scenario tasks, enabling a comprehensive and progressive assessment from basic capabilities to real-world use cases. We benchmark 11 leading LVLMs, including closed-source models such as GPT-4o and open-source models like LLaVA. Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of INS-MMBench and offers detailed insights into the strengths and limitations of current LVLMs on a variety of insurance-related multimodal tasks. We hope that INS-MMBench will accelerate the integration of LVLMs into the insurance industry and foster interdisciplinary research. Our dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/FDU-INS/INS-MMBench.</description>

      <title>Towards More Realistic Extraction Attacks: An Adversarial Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models are prone to memorizing their training data, making them vulnerable to extraction attacks. While existing research often examines isolated setups, such as a single model or a fixed prompt, real-world adversaries have a considerably larger attack surface due to access to models across various sizes and checkpoints, and repeated prompting. In this paper, we revisit extraction attacks from an adversarial perspective -- with multi-faceted access to the underlying data. We find significant churn in extraction trends, i.e., even unintuitive changes to the prompt, or targeting smaller models and earlier checkpoints, can extract distinct information. By combining multiple attacks, our adversary doubles ($2 \times$) the extraction risks, persisting even under mitigation strategies like data deduplication. We conclude with four case studies, including detecting pre-training data, copyright violations, extracting personally identifiable information, and attacking closed-source models, showing how our more realistic adversary can outperform existing adversaries in the literature.</description>

      <title>Modeling Spatial Extremal Dependence of Precipitation Using Distributional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a simulation-based estimation approach using generative neural networks to determine dependencies of precipitation maxima and their underlying uncertainty in time and space. Within the common framework of max-stable processes for extremes under temporal and spatial dependence, our methodology allows estimating the process parameters and their respective uncertainty, but also delivers an explicit nonparametric estimate of the spatial dependence through the pairwise extremal coefficient function. We illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in a thorough finite sample study where we obtain good performance in complex settings for which closed-form likelihood estimation becomes intractable. We use the technique for studying monthly rainfall maxima in Western Germany for the period 2021-2023, which is of particular interest since it contains an extreme precipitation and consecutive flooding event in July 2021 that had a massive deadly impact. Beyond the considered setting, the presented methodology and its main generative ideas also have great potential for other applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal sampling for least-squares approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Least-squares approximation is one of the most important methods for recovering an unknown function from data. While in many applications the data is fixed, in many others there is substantial freedom to choose where to sample. In this paper, we review recent progress on near-optimal random sampling strategies for (weighted) least-squares approximation in arbitrary linear spaces. We introduce the Christoffel function as a key quantity in the analysis of (weighted) least-squares approximation from random samples, then show how it can be used to construct a random sampling strategy, termed Christoffel sampling, that possesses near-optimal sample complexity: namely, the number of samples scales log-linearly in the dimension of the approximation space $n$. We discuss a series of variations, extensions and further topics, and throughout highlight connections to approximation theory, machine learning, information-based complexity and numerical linear algebra. Finally, motivated by various contemporary applications, we consider a generalization of the classical setting where the samples need not be pointwise samples of a scalar-valued function, and the approximation space need not be linear. We show that, even in this significantly more general setting, suitable generalizations of Christoffel function still determine the sample complexity. Consequently, these can be used to design enhanced, Christoffel sampling strategies in a unified way for general recovery problems. This article is largely self-contained, and intended to be accessible to nonspecialists.</description>

      <title>CANVAS: Commonsense-Aware Navigation System for Intuitive Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-life robot navigation involves more than just reaching a destination; it requires optimizing movements while addressing scenario-specific goals. An intuitive way for humans to express these goals is through abstract cues like verbal commands or rough sketches. Such human guidance may lack details or be noisy. Nonetheless, we expect robots to navigate as intended. For robots to interpret and execute these abstract instructions in line with human expectations, they must share a common understanding of basic navigation concepts with humans. To this end, we introduce CANVAS, a novel framework that combines visual and linguistic instructions for commonsense-aware navigation. Its success is driven by imitation learning, enabling the robot to learn from human navigation behavior. We present COMMAND, a comprehensive dataset with human-annotated navigation results, spanning over 48 hours and 219 km, designed to train commonsense-aware navigation systems in simulated environments. Our experiments show that CANVAS outperforms the strong rule-based system ROS NavStack across all environments, demonstrating superior performance with noisy instructions. Notably, in the orchard environment, where ROS NavStack records a 0% total success rate, CANVAS achieves a total success rate of 67%. CANVAS also closely aligns with human demonstrations and commonsense constraints, even in unseen environments. Furthermore, real-world deployment of CANVAS showcases impressive Sim2Real transfer with a total success rate of 69%, highlighting the potential of learning from human demonstrations in simulated environments for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>DeepMDV: Global Spatial Matching for Multi-depot Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of online retail and e-commerce has made effective and efficient Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) solutions essential. To meet rising demand, companies are adding more depots, which changes the VRP problem to a complex optimization task of Multi-Depot VRP (MDVRP) where the routing decisions of vehicles from multiple depots are highly interdependent. The complexities render traditional VRP methods suboptimal and non-scalable for the MDVRP. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve MDVRP addressing these interdependencies, hence achieving more effective results. The key idea is, the MDVRP can be broken down into two core spatial tasks: assigning customers to depots and optimizing the sequence of customer visits. We adopt task-decoupling approach and propose a two-stage framework that is scalable: (i) an interdependent partitioning module that embeds spatial and tour context directly into the representation space to globally match customers to depots and assign them to tours; and (ii) an independent routing module that determines the optimal visit sequence within each tour. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines across varying problem sizes, including the adaptations of learning-based solutions for single-depot VRP. Its adaptability and performance make it a practical and readily deployable solution for real-world logistics challenges.</description>

      <title>LeakAgent: RL-based Red-teaming Agent for LLM Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have discovered that large language models (LLM) may be ``fooled'' to output private information, including training data, system prompts, and personally identifiable information, under carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage either rely on manual efforts or focus solely on system prompt extraction, making them ineffective for severe risks of training data leakage. We propose LeakAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through reinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for both training data extraction and system prompt extraction. To achieve this, we propose a novel reward function to provide effective and fine-grained rewards and design novel mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation during learning and enhance the diversity of adversarial prompts. Through extensive evaluations, we first show that LeakAgent significantly outperforms existing rule-based approaches in training data extraction and automated methods in system prompt leakage. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of LeakAgent in extracting system prompts from real-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store. We further demonstrate LeakAgent's effectiveness in evading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better safety alignment. Finally, we validate our customized designs through a detailed ablation study. We release our code here https://github.com/rucnyz/LeakAgent.</description>

      <title>WildSAT: Learning Satellite Image Representations from Wildlife Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Species distributions encode valuable ecological and environmental information, yet their potential for guiding representation learning in remote sensing remains underexplored. We introduce WildSAT, which pairs satellite images with millions of geo-tagged wildlife observations readily-available on citizen science platforms. WildSAT employs a contrastive learning approach that jointly leverages satellite images, species occurrence maps, and textual habitat descriptions to train or fine-tune models. This approach significantly improves performance on diverse satellite image recognition tasks, outperforming both ImageNet-pretrained models and satellite-specific baselines. Additionally, by aligning visual and textual information, WildSAT enables zero-shot retrieval, allowing users to search geographic locations based on textual descriptions. WildSAT surpasses recent cross-modal learning methods, including approaches that align satellite images with ground imagery or wildlife photos, demonstrating the advantages of our approach. Finally, we analyze the impact of key design choices and highlight the broad applicability of WildSAT to remote sensing and biodiversity monitoring.</description>

      <title>EVA-S2PLoR: Decentralized Secure 2-party Logistic Regression with A Subtly Hadamard Product Protocol (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implementation of accurate nonlinear operators (e.g., sigmoid function) on heterogeneous datasets is a key challenge in privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). Most existing frameworks approximate it through linear operations, which not only result in significant precision loss but also introduce substantial computational overhead. This paper proposes an efficient, verifiable, and accurate security 2-party logistic regression framework (EVA-S2PLoR), which achieves accurate nonlinear function computation through a subtly secure hadamard product protocol and its derived protocols. All protocols are based on a practical semi-honest security model, which is designed for decentralized privacy-preserving application scenarios that balance efficiency, precision, and security. High efficiency and precision are guaranteed by the asynchronous computation flow on floating point numbers and the few number of fixed communication rounds in the hadamard product protocol, where robust anomaly detection is promised by dimension transformation and Monte Carlo methods. EVA-S2PLoR outperforms many advanced frameworks in terms of precision, improving the performance of the sigmoid function by about 10 orders of magnitude compared to most frameworks. Moreover, EVA-S2PLoR delivers the best overall performance in secure logistic regression experiments with training time reduced by over 47.6% under WAN settings and a classification accuracy difference of only about 0.5% compared to the plaintext model.</description>

      <title>FIT-Print: Towards False-claim-resistant Model Ownership Verification via Targeted Fingerprint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model fingerprinting is a widely adopted approach to safeguard the intellectual property rights of open-source models by preventing their unauthorized reuse. It is promising and convenient since it does not necessitate modifying the protected model. In this paper, we revisit existing fingerprinting methods and reveal that they are vulnerable to false claim attacks where adversaries falsely assert ownership of any third-party model. We demonstrate that this vulnerability mostly stems from their untargeted nature, where they generally compare the outputs of given samples on different models instead of the similarities to specific references. Motivated by these findings, we propose a targeted fingerprinting paradigm (i.e., FIT-Print) to counteract false claim attacks. Specifically, FIT-Print transforms the fingerprint into a targeted signature via optimization. Building on the principles of FIT-Print, we develop bit-wise and list-wise black-box model fingerprinting methods, i.e., FIT-ModelDiff and FIT-LIME, which exploit the distance between model outputs and the feature attribution of specific samples as the fingerprint, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark models and datasets verify the effectiveness, conferrability, and resistance to false claim attacks of our FIT-Print.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion Models are Medical Image Classifiers that Provide Explainability and Uncertainty for Free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discriminative classifiers have become a foundational tool in deep learning for medical imaging, excelling at learning separable features of complex data distributions. However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

      <title>Building Age Estimation: A New Multi-Modal Benchmark Dataset and Community Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the construction year of buildings is critical for advancing sustainability, as older structures often lack energy-efficient features. Sustainable urban planning relies on accurate building age data to reduce energy consumption and mitigate climate change. In this work, we introduce MapYourCity, a novel multi-modal benchmark dataset comprising top-view Very High Resolution (VHR) imagery, multi-spectral Earth Observation (EO) data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 constellation, and co-localized street-view images across various European cities. Each building is labeled with its construction epoch, and the task is formulated as a seven-class classification problem covering periods from 1900 to the present. To advance research in EO generalization and multi-modal learning, we organized a community-driven data challenge in 2024, hosted by ESA $\Phi$-lab, which ran for four months and attracted wide participation.
  This paper presents the Top-4 performing models from the challenge and their evaluation results. We assess model generalization on cities excluded from training to prevent data leakage, and evaluate performance under missing modality scenarios, particularly when street-view data is unavailable. Results demonstrate that building age estimation is both feasible and effective, even in previously unseen cities and when relying solely on top-view satellite imagery (i.e. with VHR and Sentinel-2 images). The new MapYourCity dataset thus provides a valuable resource for developing scalable, real-world solutions in sustainable urban analytics.</description>

      <title>Rank1: Test-Time Compute for Reranking in Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Rank1, the first reranking model trained to take advantage of test-time compute. Rank1 demonstrates the applicability within retrieval of using a reasoning language model (i.e. OpenAI's o1, Deepseek's R1, etc.) for distillation in order to rapidly improve the performance of a smaller model. We gather and open-source a dataset of more than 600,000 examples of R1 reasoning traces from queries and passages in MS MARCO. Models trained on this dataset show: (1) state-of-the-art performance on advanced reasoning and instruction following datasets; (2) work remarkably well out of distribution due to the ability to respond to user-input prompts; and (3) have explainable reasoning chains that can be given to users or RAG-based systems. Further, we demonstrate that quantized versions of these models retain strong performance while using less compute/memory. Overall, Rank1 shows that test-time compute allows for a fundamentally new type of explainable and performant reranker model for search.</description>

      <title>CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive Program Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/CodeARC</description>

      <title>DONOD: Efficient and Generalizable Instruction Fine-Tuning for LLMs via Model-Intrinsic Dataset Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ad-hoc instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) is widely adopted for domain-specific adaptation. While domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is effective and efficient, it often weakens cross-domain generalization and struggles with noisy training data. To address these challenges, we propose DONOD, a lightweight model-intrinsic data pruning method. Our approach evaluates data using two model-parameter-based metrics: Delta of Norm (DON), which captures the cumulative influence on model weights, and Norm of Delta (NOD), which quantifies weight instability. Moreover, by employing the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm, we effectively filter noisy, unlearnable, and generalization-harming samples without relying on auxiliary models during the SFT process. Experiments on mathematical tasks demonstrate that data selected by DONOD achieves superior fine-tuning efficiency and improved robustness against noisy data. By filtering out 70% of the whole dataset, we improve target-domain accuracy by 14.90% and cross-domain accuracy by 5.67%. Meanwhile, our selected data present superior cross-architecture generalization. Data pruned by smaller models (e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) generalize effectively on larger models (e.g., Llama 2-13B). Compared to existing related methodologies, DONOD demonstrates comparable or superior performance while remaining dataset-agnostic, enabling broader applicability. Code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>CRUST-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for C-to-safe-Rust Transpilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems. However, no dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into safe Rust that passes a set of test cases. We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the transpilation. By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files. The provided Rust interfaces provide explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness. We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for various state-of-the-art methods and techniques. We also provide insights into the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust. The best performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot setting. Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety. You can find the dataset and code at https://github.com/anirudhkhatry/CRUST-bench.</description>

      <title>LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>MAATS: A Multi-Agent Automated Translation System Based on MQM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency, Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
  Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs), MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic and contextual fidelity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized algorithm development, yet their application in symbolic regression, where algorithms automatically discover symbolic expressions from data, remains constrained and is typically designed manually by human experts. In this paper, we propose a meta learning framework that enables LLMs to automatically design selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution techniques: a lack of semantic guidance and code bloat. The absence of semantic awareness can lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, and bloat results in unnecessarily complex components, both of which can reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator and bloat control. Additionally, we embed domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the evolved operator can further improve the state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithm, achieving the best performance among 26 symbolic regression and machine learning algorithms across 116 regression datasets. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm design for symbolic regression.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on generative systems in music has seen considerable attention and growth in recent years. A variety of attempts have been made to systematically evaluate such systems.
  We present an interdisciplinary review of the common evaluation targets, methodologies, and metrics for the evaluation of both system output and model use, covering subjective and objective approaches, qualitative and quantitative approaches, as well as empirical and computational methods. We examine the benefits and limitations of these approaches from a musicological, an engineering, and an HCI perspective.</description>

      <title>AVA-Bench: Atomic Visual Ability Benchmark for Vision Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation. A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i) the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities, making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench, the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities (AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each, AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next generation of VFMs.</description>

      <title>Decompositional Reasoning for Graph Retrieval with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel retrieval approach that integrates textual knowledge graphs into the LLM reasoning process via query decomposition. Our method decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, retrieves relevant textual subgraphs, and composes a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. For that, we use a weighted similarity function that focuses on both the complex question and the generated subquestions to extract a relevant subgraph, which allows efficient and precise retrieval for complex questions and improves the performance of LLMs on multi-hop QA tasks. This structured reasoning pipeline enhances factual grounding and interpretability while leveraging the generative strengths of LLMs. We evaluate our method on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.</description>

      <title>Measurement as Bricolage: Examining How Data Scientists Construct Target Variables for Predictive Modeling Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy, hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the "healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints. Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem (re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g., predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings, we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better support the art and science of target variable construction.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Deception Probes via Black-to-White Performance Boosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries. Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance boosts from existing deception probes.</description>

      <title>SAMUeL: Efficient Vocal-Conditioned Music Generation via Soft Alignment Attention and Latent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lightweight latent diffusion model for vocal-conditioned musical accompaniment generation that addresses critical limitations in existing music AI systems. Our approach introduces a novel soft alignment attention mechanism that adaptively combines local and global temporal dependencies based on diffusion timesteps, enabling efficient capture of multi-scale musical structure. Operating in the compressed latent space of a pre-trained variational autoencoder, the model achieves a 220 times parameter reduction compared to state-of-the-art systems while delivering 52 times faster inference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance with only 15M parameters, outperforming OpenAI Jukebox in production quality and content unity while maintaining reasonable musical coherence. The ultra-lightweight architecture enables real-time deployment on consumer hardware, making AI-assisted music creation accessible for interactive applications and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Advancing Welding Defect Detection in Maritime Operations via Adapt-WeldNet and Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights. Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA) framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals. Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore and marine environments.</description>

      <title>PaPaformer: Language Model from Pre-trained Parallel Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training of modern large-language models requires an increasingly amount of computation power and time. Even smaller variants, such as small-language models (SLMs), take several days to train in the best-case scenarios, often requiring multiple GPUs. This paper explores methods to train and evaluate decoder-only transformer-based language models in hours instead of days/weeks. We introduces \textit{PaPaformer}, a decoder-only transformer architecture variant, whose lower-dimensional parallel paths are combined into larger model. The paper shows that these lower-dimensional paths can be trained individually with different types of training data and then combined into one larger model. This method gives the option to reduce the total number of model parameters and the training time with increasing performance. Moreover, the use of parallel path structure opens interesting possibilities to customize paths to accommodate specific task requirements.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Fleet Upgrade Decisions with Machine-Learning Enhanced Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rental-based business models and increasing sustainability requirements intensify the need for efficient strategies to manage large machine and vehicle fleet renewal and upgrades. Optimized fleet upgrade strategies maximize overall utility, cost, and sustainability. However, conventional fleet optimization does not account for upgrade options and is based on integer programming with exponential runtime scaling, which leads to substantial computational cost when dealing with large fleets and repeated decision-making processes. This contribution firstly suggests an extended integer programming approach that determines optimal renewal and upgrade decisions. The computational burden is addressed by a second, alternative machine learning-based method that transforms the task to a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. Both approaches are evaluated in a real-world automotive industry case study, which shows that the machine learning approach achieves near-optimal solutions with significant improvements in the scalability and overall computational performance, thus making it a practical alternative for large-scale fleet management.</description>

      <title>Measuring Dependencies between Biological Signals with Self-supervision, and its Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a priori knowledge regarding the nature of dependence. We introduce a self-supervised approach, concurrence, which is inspired by the observation that if two signals are dependent, then one should be able to distinguish between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them. Experiments with fMRI, physiological and behavioral signals show that, to our knowledge, concurrence is the first approach that can expose relationships across such a wide spectrum of signals and extract scientifically relevant differences without ad-hoc parameter tuning or reliance on a priori information, providing a potent tool for scientific discoveries across fields. However, dependencies caused by extraneous factors remain an open problem, thus researchers should validate that exposed relationships truly pertain to the question(s) of interest.</description>

      <title>Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion) parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of tokens for both.

      <title>An ML-based Approach to Predicting Software Change Dependencies: Insights from an Empirical Study on OpenStack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it. Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment. They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes, while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33% and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k precision has room for improvement.</description>

      <title>SPA++: Generalized Graph Spectral Alignment for Versatile Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts. Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Study of Gender Classification Techniques Based on Iris Images: A Deep Survey and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric. Over the years, several methods for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint, palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research, remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.</description>

Abstract: In functional data analysis, binary classification with one functional covariate has been extensively studied. We aim to fill in the gap of considering multivariate functional covariates in classification. In particular, we propose an $L_1$-regularized functional support vector machine for binary classification. An accompanying algorithm is developed to fit the classifier. By imposing an $L_1$ penalty, the algorithm enables us to identify relevant functional covariates of the binary response. Numerical results from simulations and one real-world application demonstrate that the proposed classifier enjoys good performance in both prediction and feature selection.</description>
