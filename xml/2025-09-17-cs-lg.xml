      <title>The 1st International Workshop on Disentangled Representation Learning for Controllable Generation (DRL4Real): Methods and Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews the 1st International Workshop on Disentangled Representation Learning for Controllable Generation (DRL4Real), held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. The workshop aimed to bridge the gap between the theoretical promise of Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) and its application in realistic scenarios, moving beyond synthetic benchmarks. DRL4Real focused on evaluating DRL methods in practical applications such as controllable generation, exploring advancements in model robustness, interpretability, and generalization. The workshop accepted 9 papers covering a broad range of topics, including the integration of novel inductive biases (e.g., language), the application of diffusion models to DRL, 3D-aware disentanglement, and the expansion of DRL into specialized domains like autonomous driving and EEG analysis. This summary details the workshop's objectives, the themes of the accepted papers, and provides an overview of the methodologies proposed by the authors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservative-dissipative dynamics are ubiquitous across a variety of complex open systems. We propose a data-driven two-phase method, the Moment-DeepRitz Method, for learning drift decompositions in generalized diffusion systems involving conservative-dissipative dynamics. The method is robust to noisy data, adaptable to rough potentials and oscillatory rotations. We demonstrate its effectiveness through several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>SOH-KLSTM: A Hybrid Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and LSTM Model for Enhanced Lithium-Ion Battery Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable State Of Health (SOH) estimation for Lithium (Li) batteries is critical to ensure the longevity, safety, and optimal performance of applications like electric vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, consumer electronics, and renewable energy storage systems. Conventional SOH estimation techniques fail to represent the non-linear and temporal aspects of battery degradation effectively. In this study, we propose a novel SOH prediction framework (SOH-KLSTM) using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-Integrated Candidate Cell State in LSTM for Li batteries Health Monitoring. This hybrid approach combines the ability of LSTM to learn long-term dependencies for accurate time series predictions with KAN's non-linear approximation capabilities to effectively capture complex degradation behaviors in Lithium batteries.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multi-view Symbolic Regression methods in physical sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing the world behavior through mathematical functions help scientists to achieve a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of different phenomena. Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first principles and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part of this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a function that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce sparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly interesting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression (MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple datasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations added support to MvSR with small differences between them. In this paper, we test and compare MvSR as supported in Operon, PySR, phy-SO, and eggp, in different real-world datasets. We show that they all often achieve good accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters. However, we find that certain features enable a more frequent generation of better models. We conclude by providing guidelines for future MvSR developments.</description>

      <title>From Noise to Precision: A Diffusion-Driven Approach to Zero-Inflated Precipitation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-inflated data pose significant challenges in precipitation forecasting due to the predominance of zeros with sparse non-zero events. To address this, we propose the Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF), which integrates Gaussian perturbation for smoothing zero-inflated distributions, Transformer-based prediction for capturing temporal patterns, and diffusion-based denoising to restore the original data structure. In our experiments, we use observational precipitation data collected from South Australia along with synthetically generated zero-inflated data. Results show that ZIDF demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple state-of-the-art precipitation forecasting models, achieving up to 56.7\% reduction in MSE and 21.1\% reduction in MAE relative to the baseline Non-stationary Transformer. These findings highlight ZIDF's ability to robustly handle sparse time series data and suggest its potential generalizability to other domains where zero inflation is a key challenge.</description>

      <title>FEDEXCHANGE: Bridging the Domain Gap in Federated Object Detection for Free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Object Detection (FOD) enables clients to collaboratively train a global object detection model without accessing their local data from diverse domains. However, significant variations in environment, weather, and other domain specific factors hinder performance, making cross domain generalization a key challenge. Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints of edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high computational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without introducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a server side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain insights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing. Specifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model aggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server aggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters and exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to learn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server side, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional computational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE enhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in challenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the computational resources compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Retrosynthesis Planning via Worst-path Policy Optimisation in Tree-structured MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning aims to decompose target molecules into available building blocks, forming a synthesis tree where each internal node represents an intermediate compound and each leaf ideally corresponds to a purchasable reactant. However, this tree becomes invalid if any leaf node is not a valid building block, making the planning process vulnerable to the "weakest link" in the synthetic route. Existing methods often optimise for average performance across branches, failing to account for this worst-case sensitivity. In this paper, we reframe retrosynthesis as a worst-path optimisation problem within tree-structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that this formulation admits a unique optimal solution and offers monotonic improvement guarantees. Building on this insight, we introduce Interactive Retrosynthesis Planning (InterRetro), a method that interacts with the tree MDP, learns a value function for worst-path outcomes, and improves its policy through self-imitation, preferentially reinforcing past decisions with high estimated advantage. Empirically, InterRetro achieves state-of-the-art results, solving 100% of targets on the Retro*-190 benchmark, shortening synthetic routes by 4.9%, and achieving promising performance using only 10% of the training data - representing a significant advance in computational retrosynthesis planning.</description>

      <title>AttnBoost: Retail Supply Chain Sales Insights via Gradient Boosting Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting product demand in retail supply chains presents a complex challenge due to noisy, heterogeneous features and rapidly shifting consumer behavior. While traditional gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) offer strong predictive performance on structured data, they often lack adaptive mechanisms to identify and emphasize the most relevant features under changing conditions. In this work, we propose AttnBoost, an interpretable learning framework that integrates feature-level attention into the boosting process to enhance both predictive accuracy and explainability. Specifically, the model dynamically adjusts feature importance during each boosting round via a lightweight attention mechanism, allowing it to focus on high-impact variables such as promotions, pricing, and seasonal trends. We evaluate AttnBoost on a large-scale retail sales dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms standard machine learning and deep tabular models, while also providing actionable insights for supply chain managers. An ablation study confirms the utility of the attention module in mitigating overfitting and improving interpretability. Our results suggest that attention-guided boosting represents a promising direction for interpretable and scalable AI in real-world forecasting applications.</description>

      <title>The Anti-Ouroboros Effect: Emergent Resilience in Large Language Models from Recursive Selective Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of recursively trained large language models (LLMs) is a foundational problem for AI safety. Prevailing theory predicts model collapse, a progressive degradation when models are trained on their own output. We challenge this narrative by introducing a selective feedback mechanism. Contrary to expectation, instead of merely slowing decay, our experiments provide strong evidence that this pressure reverses it, inducing a statistically significant performance improvement in a Gemma 2B model on a complex summarization task. We name this phenomenon the Anti-Ouroboros Effect. We contrast this with a foundational experiment using a simple classifier, where the theoretical degenerative loop was validated, highlighting the unique dynamics of high-dimensional models. Our findings establish that systemic resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure, suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more robust AI systems. Across five generations, a quality-filtered condition improved by 6.6% in ROUGE-L F1 score, whereas an unfiltered control degraded by 3.5% and a random-filter control degraded by 4.2%</description>

      <title>LogGuardQ: A Cognitive-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Framework for Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection in Security Logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision-making, but traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and adaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents LogGuardQ (Adaptive Log Guard with Cognitive enhancement), a novel framework that integrates a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition and adaptive exploration strategies driven by temperature decay and curiosity. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes, LogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate (versus 93.0% for DQN and 47.1% for PPO), with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450. The mean reward is 20.34 \pm 44.63 across all episodes (versus 18.80 \pm 43.98 for DQN and -0.17 \pm 23.79 for PPO), with an average of 5.0 steps per episode (constant across models). Graphical analyses, including learning curves smoothed with a Savgol filter (window=501, polynomial=2), variance trends, action distributions, and cumulative detections, demonstrate LogGuardQ's superior stability and efficiency. Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U) confirm significant performance advantages (e.g., p = 0.0002 vs. DQN with negligible effect size, p &lt; 0.0001 vs. PPO with medium effect size, and p &lt; 0.0001 for DQN vs. PPO with small effect size). By bridging cognitive science and RL, LogGuardQ offers a scalable approach to adaptive learning in uncertain environments, with potential applications in cybersecurity, intrusion detection, and decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Service-Oriented Adaptive Hierarchical Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a novel framework for distributed model training. In FL, the task publisher (TP) releases tasks, and local model owners (LMOs) use their local data to train models. Sometimes, FL suffers from the lack of training data, and thus workers are recruited for gathering data. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive incentive mechanism from a service-oriented perspective, with the objective of maximizing the utilities of TP, LMOs and workers. Specifically, a Stackelberg game is theoretically established between the LMOs and TP, positioning TP as the leader and the LMOs as followers. An analytical Nash equilibrium solution is derived to maximize their utilities. The interaction between LMOs and workers is formulated by a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), with the optimal strategy identified via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Additionally, an Adaptively Searching the Optimal Strategy Algorithm (ASOSA) is designed to stabilize the strategies of each participant and solve the coupling problems. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Clustered-Experts: Advancing Expert Specialization and Generalization in Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a highly scalable solution by conditionally activating sub-modules without a proportional increase in computational costs. However, improving expert specialization to enhance performance and generalization remains a challenge for MoE, especially in instruction tuning scenarios characterized by significant input heterogeneity. In this work, we propose the Mixture-of-Clustered-Experts (MoCE) to address this limitation through a dual-stage routing mechanism. The first stage in the mechanism performs expert group routing based on sequence-level features, while the second stage activates the top-$k$ experts within the group at the token level. This approach enables the effective partitioning of heterogeneous inputs based on their knowledge requirements, encouraging expert group specialization while maintaining the advantages of token-level routing. We evaluate MoCE across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, demonstrating its consistent superiority over strong baselines and its enhanced generalization capabilities. Detailed analysis further highlights the robustness and effectiveness of MoCE.</description>

      <title>A Differential Manifold Perspective and Universality Analysis of Continuous Attractors in Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous attractors are critical for information processing in both biological and artificial neural systems, with implications for spatial navigation, memory, and deep learning optimization. However, existing research lacks a unified framework to analyze their properties across diverse dynamical systems, limiting cross-architectural generalizability. This study establishes a novel framework from the perspective of differential manifolds to investigate continuous attractors in artificial neural networks. It verifies compatibility with prior conclusions, elucidates links between continuous attractor phenomena and eigenvalues of the local Jacobian matrix, and demonstrates the universality of singular value stratification in common classification models and datasets. These findings suggest continuous attractors may be ubiquitous in general neural networks, highlighting the need for a general theory, with the proposed framework offering a promising foundation given the close mathematical connection between eigenvalues and singular values.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Preference Optimization with Uncertainty-aware Utility Anchor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline preference optimization methods are efficient for large language models (LLMs) alignment. Direct Preference optimization (DPO)-like learning, one of the most popular approaches, stands out for its efficiency in reward modeling. However, these methods typically follow the convention to use Bradley-Terry (BT) reward modeling that faces several critical assumptions, including the requirement for pairwise training data, model distribution shifting, human rationality assumption, etc. To address these limitations, we propose a general framework for offline preference optimization methods, Adaptive Preference Optimization with Utility Anchor (UAPO), which introduces an anchoring function to estimate the uncertainties brought from preference data annotation. Our method enables training even in scenarios where the data is unpaired, significantly enhancing data utilization efficiency. Moreover, the anchor design makes UAPO more robust in the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that UAPO achieves competitive outcomes without the strict dependency on data pairing, paving the way for more flexible and effective preference optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Personalization in Education: A Federated Recommender System for Student Performance Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented opportunities for data-driven personalization, yet it introduces significant student data privacy challenges. Conventional recommender systems rely on centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28\%, corresponding to 82.85\% of the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy dilemma in modern educational platforms.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Benchmark of Federated Learning Strategies for Mortality Prediction on Heterogeneous and Imbalanced Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models hold significant potential for predicting in-hospital mortality, yet data privacy constraints and the statistical heterogeneity of real-world clinical data often hamper their development. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its performance under non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) and imbalanced conditions requires rigorous investigation. The study presents a comparative benchmark of five federated learning strategies: FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, and FedCluster for mortality prediction. Using the large-scale MIMIC-IV dataset, we simulate a realistic non-IID environment by partitioning data by clinical care unit. To address the inherent class imbalance of the task, the SMOTE-Tomek technique is applied to each client's local training data. Our experiments, conducted over 50 communication rounds, reveal that the regularization-based strategy, FedProx, consistently outperformed other methods, achieving the highest F1-Score of 0.8831 while maintaining stable convergence. While the baseline FedAvg was the most computationally efficient, its predictive performance was substantially lower. Our findings indicate that regularization-based FL algorithms like FedProx offer a more robust and effective solution for heterogeneous and imbalanced clinical prediction tasks than standard or server-side adaptive aggregation methods. The work provides a crucial empirical benchmark for selecting appropriate FL strategies for real-world healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Holographic Knowledge Manifolds: A Novel Pipeline for Continual Learning Without Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Holographic Knowledge Manifold (HKM), a four-phase pipeline that achieves zero catastrophic forgetting in AI knowledge representation while maintaining minimal memory growth and high efficiency. Leveraging fractal quantization, probabilistic entanglement, and dynamic diffraction chipping, HKM compresses knowledge substrates by 3x with 67% storage savings, integrates holographically at 100%, and supports over 1,020 updates with 1% growth per increment. In experiments on combined WikiText and FB15k datasets (scaled to 2,997 nodes), we demonstrate industry-leading performance: 0% forgetting (infinite improvement over GEM baselines), 3x compression, and 53% training time reduction on consumer GPU hardware. Hypothetical cost analyses project $92.4M savings over 5 years at petabyte scale, with 21.2% energy reduction and 33% lower carbon footprint. This work hypothesizes a paradigm shift for public large language models (LLMs), enabling "eternal" adaptation without retraining. Future extensions to multimodal fusion and quantum hardware could further democratize scalable AI, potentially reducing fine-tuning costs by 60-80% for models like Llama-3 or Grok-4. Code, datasets, and full results are publicly available for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Gradient Estimation Methods of Approximate Multipliers for High-Accuracy Retraining of Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate multipliers (AppMults) are widely used in deep learning accelerators to reduce their area, delay, and power consumption. However, AppMults introduce arithmetic errors into deep learning models, necessitating a retraining process to recover accuracy. A key step in retraining is computing the gradient of the AppMult, i.e., the partial derivative of the approximate product with respect to each input operand. Existing approaches typically estimate this gradient using that of the accurate multiplier (AccMult), which can lead to suboptimal retraining results. To address this, we propose two methods to obtain more precise gradients of AppMults. The first, called LUT-2D, characterizes the AppMult gradient with 2-dimensional lookup tables (LUTs), providing fine-grained estimation and achieving the highest retraining accuracy. The second, called LUT-1D, is a compact and more efficient variant that stores gradient values in 1-dimensional LUTs, achieving comparable retraining accuracy with shorter runtime. Experimental results show that on CIFAR-10 with convolutional neural networks, our LUT-2D and LUT-1D methods improve retraining accuracy by 3.83% and 3.72% on average, respectively. On ImageNet with vision transformer models, our LUT-1D method improves retraining accuracy by 23.69% on average, compared to a state-of-the-art retraining framework.</description>

      <title>Offline Contextual Bandit with Counterfactual Sample Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In production systems, contextual bandit approaches often rely on direct reward models that take both action and context as input. However, these models can suffer from confounding, making it difficult to isolate the effect of the action from that of the context. We present \emph{Counterfactual Sample Identification}, a new approach that re-frames the problem: rather than predicting reward, it learns to recognize which action led to a successful (binary) outcome by comparing it to a counterfactual action sampled from the logging policy under the same context. The method is theoretically grounded and consistently outperforms direct models in both synthetic experiments and real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Variational Gaussian Mixture Manifold Models for Client-Specific Federated Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) often fails under label skew and non-stationarity because a single global parameterization ignores client-specific geometry. We introduce VGM$^2$ (Variational Gaussian Mixture Manifold), a geometry-centric PFL framework that (i) learns client-specific parametric UMAP embeddings, (ii) models latent pairwise distances with mixture relation markers for same and different class pairs, and (iii) exchanges only variational, uncertainty-aware marker statistics. Each client maintains a Dirichlet-Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Dir-NIG) posterior over marker weights, means, and variances; the server aggregates via conjugate moment matching to form global priors that guide subsequent rounds. We prove that this aggregation minimizes the summed reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence from client posteriors within the conjugate family, yielding stability under heterogeneity. We further incorporate a calibration term for distance-to-similarity mapping and report communication and compute budgets. Across eight vision datasets with non-IID label shards, VGM$^2$ achieves competitive or superior test F1 scores compared to strong baselines while communicating only small geometry summaries. Privacy is strengthened through secure aggregation and optional differential privacy noise, and we provide a membership-inference stress test. Code and configurations will be released to ensure full reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Deep Learning for ATCO Command Lifecycle Modeling and Workload Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) issue high-intensity voice commands in dense airspace, where accurate workload modeling is critical for safety and efficiency. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates structured data, trajectory sequences, and image features to estimate two key parameters in the ATCO command lifecycle: the time offset between a command and the resulting aircraft maneuver, and the command duration. A high-quality dataset was constructed, with maneuver points detected using sliding window and histogram-based methods. A CNN-Transformer ensemble model was developed for accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions. By linking trajectories to voice commands, this work offers the first model of its kind to support intelligent command generation and provides practical value for workload assessment, staffing, and scheduling.</description>

      <title>From Predictions to Explanations: Explainable AI for Autism Diagnosis and Identification of Critical Brain Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by atypical brain maturation. However, the adaptation of transfer learning paradigms in machine learning for ASD research remains notably limited. In this study, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic framework with two modules. This chapter presents a two-module framework combining deep learning and explainable AI for ASD diagnosis. The first module leverages a deep learning model fine-tuned through cross-domain transfer learning for ASD classification. The second module focuses on interpreting the model decisions and identifying critical brain regions. To achieve this, we employed three explainable AI (XAI) techniques: saliency mapping, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. This framework demonstrates that cross-domain transfer learning can effectively address data scarcity in ASD research. In addition, by applying three established explainability techniques, the approach reveals how the model makes diagnostic decisions and identifies brain regions most associated with ASD. These findings were compared against established neurobiological evidence, highlighting strong alignment and reinforcing the clinical relevance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Resource-Aware Neural Network Pruning Using Graph-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural network pruning by integrating a graph-based observation space into an AutoML framework to address the limitations of existing methods. Traditional pruning approaches often depend on hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to suboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework transforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the target neural network that captures complete topological relationships between layers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a global view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph Attention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph representation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action space we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary action spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance criteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions. These contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while adhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we design a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform its previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments show that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques, showing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning strategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple weight magnitude considerations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban spatio-temporal data present unique challenges for predictive analytics due to their dynamic and complex nature. We introduce STM-Graph, an open-source Python framework that transforms raw spatio-temporal urban event data into graph representations suitable for Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and prediction. STM-Graph integrates diverse spatial mapping methods, urban features from OpenStreetMap, multiple GNN models, comprehensive visualization tools, and a graphical user interface (GUI) suitable for professional and non-professional users. This modular and extensible framework facilitates rapid experimentation and benchmarking. It allows integration of new mapping methods and custom models, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in urban computing. The source code of the framework and GUI are available at: https://github.com/Ahghaffari/stm_graph and https://github.com/tuminguyen/stm_graph_gui.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting and Mode Collapse in Text-to-Image Diffusion via Latent Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with "catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14% higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly, random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive computational costs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Adaptive Shared Experts with Grouped Multi-Head Attention Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture have made significant progress in long-sequence modeling, but existing models still have shortcomings in computational efficiency and the ability to capture long-range dependencies, especially in terms of the dynamic adaptability of expert resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Shared Expert and Grouped Multi-Head Attention Hybrid Model (DASG-MoE) to enhance long-sequence modeling capabilities by integrating three modules. First, we employ the Grouped Multi-Head Attention (GMHA) mechanism to effectively reduce the computational complexity of long sequences. By parallel processing through sequence grouping, local sliding window attention, and feature aggregation, we address long-range dependency issues and the model's lack of generalization for local information. Second, we design a Dual-Scale Shared Expert Structure (DSSE), where shallow experts use lightweight computations to quickly respond to low-dimensional features, while deep experts process high-dimensional complex semantics through pre-training transfer and post-training optimization, achieving a dynamic balance between efficiency and accuracy. Third, we propose a hierarchical Adaptive Dynamic Routing (ADR) mechanism that dynamically selects expert levels based on feature complexity and task requirements, and optimizes resource allocation through a local expert activation strategy. Experiments on multiple long-sequence benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DASG-MoE model outperforms state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>FinXplore: An Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Balancing and Discovering Investment Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is essential for balancing risk and return in financial decision-making. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has stood out as a cutting-edge tool for portfolio optimization that learns dynamic asset allocation using trial-and-error interactions. However, most DRL-based methods are restricted to allocating assets within a pre-defined investment universe and overlook exploring new opportunities. This study introduces an investment landscape that integrates exploiting existing assets with exploring new investment opportunities in an extended universe. The proposed approach leverages two DRL agents and dynamically balances these objectives to adapt to evolving markets while enhancing portfolio performance. One agent allocates assets within the existing universe, while another assists in exploring new opportunities in the extended universe. The effciency of the proposed methodology is determined using two real-world market data sets. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of the suggested approach against the state-of-the-art portfolio strategies and baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Decoupling the "What" and "Where" With Polar Coordinate Positional Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attention mechanism in a Transformer architecture matches key to query based on both content -- the what -- and position in a sequence -- the where. We present an analysis indicating that what and where are entangled in the popular RoPE rotary position embedding. This entanglement can impair performance particularly when decisions require independent matches on these two factors. We propose an improvement to RoPE, which we call Polar Coordinate Position Embeddings or PoPE, that eliminates the what-where confound. PoPE is far superior on a diagnostic task requiring indexing solely by position or by content. On autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural language domains, Transformers using PoPE as the positional encoding scheme outperform baselines using RoPE with respect to evaluation loss (perplexity) and downstream task performance. On language modeling, these gains persist across model scale, from 124M to 774M parameters. Crucially, PoPE shows strong zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities, whereas RoPE's performance degrades significantly on longer sequences at test time without fine tuning or the use of position-interpolation methods.</description>

      <title>Semantic-guided LoRA Parameters Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across a variety of tasks for efficiently fine-tuning AI models, especially on resource-constrained edges. However, in real-world applications, edge users often exhibit task-specific preferences that are difficult to handle with a unified model trained under a closed-world assumption, and the challenge may further increase when there are significant domain shifts between training and deployment. Meanwhile, retraining/fine-tuning models for each user is also impractical due to its cost-intensive nature and privacy concerns over raw data utilization from edges. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-guided LoRA Parameter Generation (SG-LoRA), the first of its kind framework to efficiently produce user-specific LoRA parameters without any additional training on user tasks or access to user-specific data. Concretely, SG-LoRA uses task descriptions as the semantic bridge, measuring their proximity to a set of known expert tasks in a shared embedding space. Based on this semantic guidance, it models the target task's LoRA parameter distribution to generate high-performing parameters for novel tasks. SG-LoRA enables the real-time construction of LoRA models aligned with individual intents by distilling knowledge from prominent LoRA experts and, meanwhile, offering a privacy-preserving solution for personalized model adaptation in a novel zero-shot open-world setting proposed in this work. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging tasks confirm the superior performance and remarkable adaptability of SG-LoRA.

      <title>Contextuality, Holonomy and Discrete Fiber Bundles in Group-Valued Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometric extension of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) by allowing weights to take values in abstract groups such as \( \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}) \), \( \mathrm{SU}(2) \), or even infinite-dimensional operator groups. This generalization enables the modeling of complex relational structures, including projective transformations, spinor dynamics, and functional symmetries, with direct applications to vision, language, and quantum learning.
  A central contribution of this work is the introduction of a \emph{contextuality index} based on group-valued holonomies computed along cycles in the RBM graph. This index quantifies the global inconsistency or "curvature" induced by local weights, generalizing classical notions of coherence, consistency, and geometric flatness. We establish links with sheaf-theoretic contextuality, gauge theory, and noncommutative geometry, and provide numerical and diagrammatic examples in both finite and infinite dimensions.
  This framework opens novel directions in AI, from curvature-aware learning architectures to topological regularization in uncertain or adversarial environments.</description>

      <title>On Using Large-Batches in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient Federated learning (FL) is crucial for training deep networks over devices with limited compute resources and bounded networks. With the advent of big data, devices either generate or collect multimodal data to train either generic or local-context aware networks, particularly when data privacy and locality is vital. FL algorithms generally trade-off between parallel and statistical performance, improving model quality at the cost of higher communication frequency, or vice versa. Under frequent synchronization settings, FL over a large cluster of devices may perform more work per-training iteration by processing a larger global batch-size, thus attaining considerable training speedup. However, this may result in poor test performance (i.e., low test loss or accuracy) due to generalization degradation issues associated with large-batch training. To address these challenges with large-batches, this work proposes our vision of exploiting the trade-offs between small and large-batch training, and explore new directions to enjoy both the parallel scaling of large-batches and good generalizability of small-batch training. For the same number of iterations, we observe that our proposed large-batch training technique attains about 32.33% and 3.74% higher test accuracy than small-batch training in ResNet50 and VGG11 models respectively.</description>

      <title>DualAlign: Generating Clinically Grounded Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic clinical data are increasingly important for advancing AI in healthcare, given strict privacy constraints on real-world EHRs, limited availability of annotated rare-condition data, and systemic biases in observational datasets. While large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent clinical text, producing synthetic data that is both realistic and clinically meaningful remains challenging. We introduce DualAlign, a framework that enhances statistical fidelity and clinical plausibility through dual alignment: (1) statistical alignment, which conditions generation on patient demographics and risk factors; and (2) semantic alignment, which incorporates real-world symptom trajectories to guide content generation. Using Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a case study, DualAlign produces context-grounded symptom-level sentences that better reflect real-world clinical documentation. Fine-tuning an LLaMA 3.1-8B model with a combination of DualAlign-generated and human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over models trained on gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines. While DualAlign does not fully capture longitudinal complexity, it offers a practical approach for generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support low-resource clinical text analysis.</description>

      <title>GTS_Forecaster: a novel deep learning based geodetic time series forecasting toolbox with python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geodetic time series -- such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positions, satellite altimetry-derived sea surface height (SSH), and tide gauge (TG) records -- is essential for monitoring surface deformation and sea level change. Accurate forecasts of these variables can enhance early warning systems and support hazard mitigation for earthquakes, landslides, coastal storm surge, and long-term sea level. However, the nonlinear, non-stationary, and incomplete nature of such variables presents significant challenges for classic models, which often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We introduce GTS Forecaster, an open-source Python package for geodetic time series forecasting. It integrates advanced deep learning models -- including kernel attention networks (KAN), graph neural network-based gated recurrent units (GNNGRU), and time-aware graph neural networks (TimeGNN) -- to effectively model nonlinear spatial-temporal patterns. The package also provides robust preprocessing tools, including outlier detection and a reinforcement learning-based gap-filling algorithm, the Kalman-TransFusion Interpolation Framework (KTIF). GTS Forecaster currently supports forecasting, visualization, and evaluation of GNSS, SSH, and TG datasets, and is adaptable to general time series applications. By combining cutting-edge models with an accessible interface, it facilitates the application of deep learning in geodetic forecasting tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping today's business practices, however, their adoption within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) raises significant technical, ethical and trust issues. This paper proposes a structured, multi-phased framework designed to embed trust and ethical principles throughout the AI lifecycle for their secure and responsible use in SMEs. Structured around four pillars, i.e., Data, Algorithms, Human oversight, and Model Architecture, the framework bridges theoretical ethical principles with operational practice, enhancing AI capabilities in diverse SME applications. Ultimately, this paper offers a structured roadmap for responsible AI adoption, framing trust and ethics as a catalyst for resilience, competitiveness, and sustainable innovation in SMEs.</description>

      <title>pySigLib -- Fast Signature-Based Computations on CPU and GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signature-based methods have recently gained significant traction in machine learning for sequential data. In particular, signature kernels have emerged as powerful discriminators and training losses for generative models on time-series, notably in quantitative finance. However, existing implementations do not scale to the dataset sizes and sequence lengths encountered in practice. We present pySigLib, a high-performance Python library offering optimised implementations of signatures and signature kernels on CPU and GPU, fully compatible with PyTorch's automatic differentiation. Beyond an efficient software stack for large-scale signature-based computation, we introduce a novel differentiation scheme for signature kernels that delivers accurate gradients at a fraction of the runtime of existing libraries.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge: Minimum Spanning Tree over Measure-valued Vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge (MSB) finds the optimal coupling among a collection of random vectors with known statistics and a known correlation structure. In the MSB formulation, this correlation structure is specified \emph{a priori} as an undirected connected graph with measure-valued vertices. In this work, we formulate and solve the problem of finding the optimal MSB in the sense we seek the optimal coupling over all possible graph structures. We find that computing the optimal MSB amounts to solving the minimum spanning tree problem over measure-valued vertices. We show that the resulting problem can be solved in two steps. The first step constructs a complete graph with edge weight equal to a sum of the optimal value of the corresponding bimarginal SB and the entropies of the endpoints. The second step solves a standard minimum spanning tree problem over that complete weighted graph. Numerical experiments illustrate the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Interpretable neural network system identification method for two families of second-order systems based on characteristic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear system identification often involves a fundamental trade-off between interpretability and flexibility, often requiring the incorporation of physical constraints. We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines the mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the flexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the concept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear functions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is modeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation of the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based formalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which extends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the mathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC, which represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which uses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results show that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple polynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast, NN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex nonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip systems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based framework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities while maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the CCs. This balance makes it well-suited for modeling systems with discontinuities and complex nonlinearities that are challenging to assess using traditional polynomial or sparse regression methods, providing a powerful tool for nonlinear system identification.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Private Diagnosis of Rare Genetic Syndromes from Facial Images with Federated Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in facial dysmorphology, where characteristic facial features provide diagnostic clues for rare genetic disorders. GestaltMatcher, a leading framework in this field, has demonstrated clinical utility across multiple studies, but its reliance on centralized datasets limits further development, as patient data are siloed across institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations. We introduce a federated GestaltMatcher service based on a cross-silo horizontal federated learning framework, which allows hospitals to collaboratively train a global ensemble feature extractor without sharing patient images. Patient data are mapped into a shared latent space, and a privacy-preserving kernel matrix computation framework enables syndrome inference and discovery while safeguarding confidentiality. New participants can directly benefit from and contribute to the system by adopting the global feature extractor and kernel configuration from previous training rounds. Experiments show that the federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains robust to both varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Warmup for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Goal-Reaching Results in Multi-Agent Cooperation and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For groups of autonomous agents to achieve a particular goal, they must engage in coordination and long-horizon reasoning. However, designing reward functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative approaches never witness a single successful trial.</description>

      <title>M4GN: Mesh-based Multi-segment Hierarchical Graph Network for Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective surrogates for PDE simulations, yet their deep message passing incurs high cost and over-smoothing on large, long-range meshes; hierarchical GNNs shorten propagation paths but still face two key obstacles: (i) building coarse graphs that respect mesh topology, geometry, and physical discontinuities, and (ii) maintaining fine-scale accuracy without sacrificing the speed gained from coarsening. We tackle these challenges with M4GN, a three-tier, segment-centric hierarchical network. M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that pairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by modal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically consistent nodes. These segments are encoded by a permutation-invariant aggregator, avoiding the order sensitivity and quadratic cost of aggregation approaches used in prior works. The resulting information bridges a micro-level GNN, which captures local dynamics, and a macro-level transformer that reasons efficiently across segments, achieving a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency. Evaluated on multiple representative benchmark datasets, M4GN improves prediction accuracy by up to 56% while achieving up to 22% faster inference than state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Least-Ambiguous Multi-Label Classifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-label learning often requires identifying all relevant labels for training instances, but collecting full label annotations is costly and labor-intensive. In many datasets, only a single positive label is annotated per training instance, despite the presence of multiple relevant labels. This setting, known as single-positive multi-label learning (SPMLL), presents a significant challenge due to its extreme form of partial supervision. We propose a model-agnostic approach to SPMLL that draws on conformal prediction to produce calibrated set-valued outputs, enabling reliable multi-label predictions at test time. Our method bridges the supervision gap between single-label training and multi-label evaluation without relying on label distribution assumptions. We evaluate our approach on 12 benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements over existing baselines and practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Learning Concave Bid Shading Strategies in Online Auctions via Measure-valued Proximal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a bid shading strategy for first-price auctions as a measure-valued optimization problem. We consider a standard parametric form for bid shading and formulate the problem as convex optimization over the joint distribution of shading parameters. After each auction, the shading parameter distribution is adapted via a regularized Wasserstein-proximal update with a data-driven energy functional. This energy functional is conditional on the context, i.e., on publisher/user attributes such as domain, ad slot type, device, or location. The proposed algorithm encourages the bid distribution to place more weight on values with higher expected surplus, i.e., where the win probability and the value gap are both large. We show that the resulting measure-valued convex optimization problem admits a closed form solution. A numerical example illustrates the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Verifying Computational Graphs in Production-Grade Distributed Machine Learning Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning frameworks support very large models by incorporating parallelism and optimization techniques. Yet, these very techniques add new layers of complexity, introducing silent errors that severely degrade model performance. Existing solutions are either ad hoc or too costly for production.
  We present Scalify, a lightweight framework that exposes silent errors by verifying semantic equivalence of computational graphs using equality saturation and Datalog-style reasoning. To scale, Scalify partitions graphs with parallel rewriting and layer memoization, reuses rewrite templates, and augments equality saturation with relational reasoning and symbolic bijection inference. It further localizes discrepancies to precise code sites, turning verification results into actionable debugging guidance. Scalify verifies models as large as Llama-3.1-405B within minutes on a commodity machine and exposed five unknown bugs in Amazon production machine learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Kalman Bayesian Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential fine-tuning of transformers is useful when new data arrive sequentially, especially with shifting distributions. Unlike batch learning, sequential learning demands that training be stabilized despite a small amount of data by balancing new information and previously learned knowledge in the pre-trained models. This challenge is further complicated when training is to be completed in latency-critical environments and learning must additionally quantify and be mediated by uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel method that frames sequential fine-tuning as a posterior inference problem within a Bayesian framework. Our approach integrates closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural Networks, and Taylor approximations of the moments of softmax functions. By explicitly accounting for pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balancing them against new information based on quantified uncertainty, our method achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving sequential adaptation of a decision transformer to tasks characterized by distribution shifts and limited memory resources.</description>

      <title>CrunchLLM: Multitask LLMs for Structured Business Reasoning and Outcome Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present \textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and innovation policy.</description>

      <title>Using LLMs for Late Multimodal Sensor Fusion for Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor data streams provide valuable information around activities and context for downstream applications, though integrating complementary information can be challenging. We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used for late fusion for activity classification from audio and motion time series data. We curated a subset of data for diverse activity recognition across contexts (e.g., household activities, sports) from the Ego4D dataset. Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores significantly above chance, with no task-specific training. Zero-shot classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data for learning a shared embedding space. Additionally, LLM-based fusion can enable model deploying without requiring additional memory and computation for targeted application-specific multimodal models.</description>

      <title>Matched-Pair Experimental Design with Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matched-pair experimental designs aim to detect treatment effects by pairing participants and comparing within-pair outcome differences. In many situations, the overall effect size is small across the entire population. Then, the focus naturally shifts to identifying and targeting high treatment-effect regions where the intervention is most effective. This paper proposes a matched-pair experimental design that sequentially and actively enrolls patients in high treatment-effect regions. Importantly, we frame the identification of the target region as a classification problem and propose an active learning framework tailored to matched-pair designs. The proposed design not only reduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures that the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions. Our theoretical analysis of the framework's label complexity, along with experiments in practical scenarios, demonstrates the efficiency and advantages of the approach.</description>

      <title>HalluField: Detecting LLM Hallucinations via Field-Theoretic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and question-answering capabilities. However, they often produce inaccurate or unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the model's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics. Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and datasets.</description>

      <title>Contextual Budget Bandit for Food Rescue Volunteer Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volunteer-based food rescue platforms tackle food waste by matching surplus food to communities in need. These platforms face the dual problem of maintaining volunteer engagement and maximizing the food rescued. Existing algorithms to improve volunteer engagement exacerbate geographical disparities, leaving some communities systematically disadvantaged. We address this issue by proposing Contextual Budget Bandit. Contextual Budget Bandit incorporates context-dependent budget allocation in restless multi-armed bandits, a model of decision-making which allows for stateful arms. By doing so, we can allocate higher budgets to communities with lower match rates, thereby alleviating geographical disparities. To tackle this problem, we develop an empirically fast heuristic algorithm. Because the heuristic algorithm can achieve a poor approximation when active volunteers are scarce, we design the Mitosis algorithm, which is guaranteed to compute the optimal budget allocation. Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baselines on both synthetic and real-world food rescue datasets, and show how our algorithm achieves geographical fairness in food rescue.</description>

      <title>GoldenTransformer: A Modular Fault Injection Framework for Transformer Robustness Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have become the foundation for a wide range of state--of--the--art models across natural language processing, computer vision, and other machine learning domains. Despite their widespread deployment, the robustness of these models under fault conditions remains underexplored. We present GoldenTransformer, a modular and extensible fault injection framework designed to evaluate the resiliency of Large Language Models to induced hardware faults. GoldenTransformer offers a unified Python-based platform for injecting diverse classes of faults--such as weight corruption, activation injections, and attention--level disruptions--into pretrained transformer--based models. Inspired by the GoldenEye simulator for DNNs, our framework focuses on the unique challenges of working with large transformer architectures, including considerations such as structural complexity, latent dependencies, and nonuniform layer definitions. GoldenTransformer is built atop PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers, and it supports experiment reproducibility, metric logging, and visualization out of the box. We detail the technical design and use of GoldenTransformer and demonstrate through several example experiments on classification and generation tasks. By enabling controlled injection of faults at multiple logical and structural points in a transformer, GoldenTransformer offers researchers and practitioners a valuable tool for model robustness analysis and for guiding dependable system design in real-world LLM applications.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders: Select-and-Project for Fairness and Control from Encoder Features Alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven valuable due to their ability to provide interpretable and steerable representations. Current debiasing methods based on SAEs manipulate these sparse activations presuming that feature representations are housed within decoder weights. We challenge this fundamental assumption and introduce an encoder-focused alternative for representation debiasing, contributing three key findings: (i) we highlight an unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) we propose a novel SAE debiasing methodology that orthogonalizes input embeddings against encoder weights, and (iii) we establish a performance-preserving mechanism during debiasing through encoder weight interpolation. Our Selection and Projection framework, termed S\&amp;P TopK, surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness metrics by a factor of up to 3.2 and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM debiasing results by a factor of up to 1.8 while maintaining downstream performance.</description>

      <title>FACTORS: Factorial Approximation for Complementary Two-factor Optimization with Risk-aware Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose FACTORS, a framework that combines design of experiments with Shapley decomposition to address performance and stability issues that are sensitive to combinations of training factors. Our approach consistently estimates main effects and two-factor interactions, then integrates them into a risk-adjusted objective function that jointly accounts for uncertainty and cost, enabling reliable selection of configurations under a fixed budget. Effect estimation is implemented through two complementary paths: a plug-in path based on conditional means, and a least-squares path that reconstructs Shapley contributions from samples. These paths are designed to work complementarily even when design density and bias levels differ. By incorporating standardization of estimates, bias correction, and uncertainty quantification, our procedure ensures comparability across heterogeneous factor spaces and designs, while a lightweight search routine yields configurations within practical time even for large factor spaces. On the theoretical side, we provide error decompositions, sample complexity analysis, and upper bounds on optimality gaps. On the interpretive side, we summarize main effects and interactions in map form, highlighting adjustment priorities and safe improvement pathways. Across diverse datasets and design conditions, our approach improves rank preservation and optimal configuration identification, reduces decision-making risks, and offers a tuning foundation that delivers interpretable justification alongside stable performance gains even under budget constraints.</description>

Abstract: Transfer learning is commonly utilized in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and medical imaging due to its impressive capability to address subtasks and work with different datasets.

In this paper, we present an innovative neurosymbolic AI framework designed for network intrusion detection systems, which play a crucial role in combating malicious activities in cybersecurity. Our framework leverages transfer learning and uncertainty quantification. The findings indicate that transfer learning models, trained on large and well-structured datasets, outperform neural-based models that rely on smaller datasets, paving the way for a new era in cybersecurity solutions.</description>

      <title>CogGNN: Cognitive Graph Neural Networks in Generative Connectomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative learning has advanced network neuroscience, enabling tasks like graph super-resolution, temporal graph prediction, and multimodal brain graph fusion. However, current methods, mainly based on graph neural networks (GNNs), focus solely on structural and topological properties, neglecting cognitive traits. To address this, we introduce the first cognified generative model, CogGNN, which endows GNNs with cognitive capabilities (e.g., visual memory) to generate brain networks that preserve cognitive features. While broadly applicable, we present CogGNN, a specific variant designed to integrate visual input, a key factor in brain functions like pattern recognition and memory recall. As a proof of concept, we use our model to learn connectional brain templates (CBTs), population-level fingerprints from multi-view brain networks. Unlike prior work that overlooks cognitive properties, CogGNN generates CBTs that are both cognitively and structurally meaningful. Our contributions are: (i) a novel cognition-aware generative model with a visual-memory-based loss; (ii) a CBT-learning framework with a co-optimization strategy to yield well-centered, discriminative, cognitively enhanced templates. Extensive experiments show that CogGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a strong foundation for cognitively grounded brain network modeling.</description>

      <title>GTHNA: Local-global Graph Transformer with Memory Reconstruction for Holistic Node Anomaly Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals, resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly detection across various graph domains.</description>

      <title>Optimal message passing for molecular prediction is simple, attentive and spatial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs and feature sets.
  In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for high-throughput screening campaigns.</description>

      <title>Robustifying Diffusion-Denoised Smoothing Against Covariate Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results. However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ahedayat/Robustifying-DDS-Against-Covariate-Shift</description>

      <title>ToMA: Token Merge with Attention for Image Generation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta &lt; 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Model Transparency: Interpretability versus Explainability in Deep Learning with MNIST and IMDB Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impressive capabilities of deep learning models are often counterbalanced by their inherent opacity, commonly termed the "black box" problem, which impedes their widespread acceptance in high-trust domains. In response, the intersecting disciplines of interpretability and explainability, collectively falling under the Explainable AI (XAI) umbrella, have become focal points of research. Although these terms are frequently used as synonyms, they carry distinct conceptual weights. This document offers a comparative exploration of interpretability and explainability within the deep learning paradigm, carefully outlining their respective definitions, objectives, prevalent methodologies, and inherent difficulties. Through illustrative examinations of the MNIST digit classification task and IMDB sentiment analysis, we substantiate a key argument: interpretability generally pertains to a model's inherent capacity for human comprehension of its operational mechanisms (global understanding), whereas explainability is more commonly associated with post-hoc techniques designed to illuminate the basis for a model's individual predictions or behaviors (local explanations). For example, feature attribution methods can reveal why a specific MNIST image is recognized as a '7', and word-level importance can clarify an IMDB sentiment outcome. However, these local insights do not render the complex underlying model globally transparent. A clear grasp of this differentiation, as demonstrated by these standard datasets, is vital for fostering dependable and sound artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>The Psychogenic Machine: Simulating AI Psychosis, Delusion Reinforcement and Harm Enablement in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Emerging reports of "AI psychosis" are on the rise, where user-LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis or adverse psychological symptoms. The sycophantic and agreeable nature of LLMs can beneficial, it can become a vector for harm by reinforcing delusional beliefs in vulnerable users.
  Methods: We introduce psychosis-bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the psychogenicity of LLMs comprimising 16 structured, 12-turn conversational scenarios simulating the progression of delusional themes(Erotic Delusions, Grandiose/Messianic Delusions, Referential Delusions) and potential harms. We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion Confirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across explicit and implicit conversational contexts.
  Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated psychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than challenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled harmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\pm$0.84) and offered safety interventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37 $\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered. Performance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more likely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions (p &lt; .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77). Model performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent property of scale alone.
  Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk and underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame this issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health imperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.</description>

      <title>PHLoRA: data-free Post-hoc Low-Rank Adapter extraction from full-rank checkpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PHLoRA (Pronounced "flora"). (Post-hoc LoRA), a simple yet powerful method to extract low-rank adaptation adapters from full-rank fine-tuned models without requiring access to training data or gradients. By computing the low-rank decomposition of weight differences between a base model and its fine-tuned counterpart, our method reconstructs adapter modules that can be merged or dynamically routed at inference time via S-LoRA, or served in scalable, industry settings using platforms like NVIDIA NIM. This approach amortizes latency overhead across requests and yields substantial cost savings. Unlike prior work that trains each adapter explicitly, our approach decouples fine-tuning from adapter generation, allowing adapter extraction from existing full-rank models or third-party checkpoints. Experiments on text, image, and video benchmarks using the Amazon Nova model family demonstrate that extracted adapters preserve high energy from the full weight delta, can be pruned safely, and yield negligible degradation in downstream task performance when re-merged. Overall, PHLoRA provides a practical path for making all existing full-rank checkpoints adapter-ready, democratizing scalable inference for all models.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Search and Learning in Neural Net Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient descent typically converges to a single minimum of the training loss without mechanisms to explore alternative minima that may generalize better. Searching for diverse minima directly in high-dimensional parameter space is generally intractable. To address this, we propose a framework that performs training in two distinct phases: search in a tractable representation space (the space of intermediate activations) to find diverse representational solutions, and gradient-based learning in parameter space by regressing to those searched representations. Through evolutionary search, we discover representational solutions whose fitness and diversity scale with compute--larger populations and more generations produce better and more varied solutions. These representations prove to be learnable: networks trained by regressing to searched representations approach SGD's performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Performance improves with search compute up to saturation. The resulting models differ qualitatively from networks trained with gradient descent, following different representational trajectories during training. This work demonstrates how future training algorithms could overcome gradient descent's exploratory limitations by decoupling search in representation space from efficient gradient-based learning in parameter space.</description>

      <title>California Wildfire Inventory (CAWFI): An Extensive Dataset for Predictive Techniques based on Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to climate change and the disruption of ecosystems worldwide, wildfires are increasingly impacting environment, infrastructure, and human lives globally. Additionally, an exacerbating climate crisis means that these losses would continue to grow if preventative measures are not implemented. Though recent advancements in artificial intelligence enable wildfire management techniques, most deployed solutions focus on detecting wildfires after ignition. The development of predictive techniques with high accuracy requires extensive datasets to train machine learning models. This paper presents the California Wildfire Inventory (CAWFI), a wildfire database of over 37 million data points for building and training wildfire prediction solutions, thereby potentially preventing megafires and flash fires by addressing them before they spark. The dataset compiles daily historical California wildfire data from 2012 to 2018 and indicator data from 2012 to 2022. The indicator data consists of leading indicators (meteorological data correlating to wildfire-prone conditions), trailing indicators (environmental data correlating to prior and early wildfire activity), and geological indicators (vegetation and elevation data dictating wildfire risk and spread patterns). CAWFI has already demonstrated success when used to train a spatio-temporal artificial intelligence model, predicting 85.7% of future wildfires larger than 300,000 acres when trained on 2012-2017 indicator data. This dataset is intended to enable wildfire prediction research and solutions as well as set a precedent for future wildfire databases in other regions.</description>

      <title>FragmentGPT: A Unified GPT Model for Fragment Growing, Linking, and Merging in Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities, and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Ensemble Weather Forecasting with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field, recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically autoregressive and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in climate science, where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with. In this work, we explore the impact of curated data selection on these autoregressive diffusion models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies and show that a simple time stratified sampling approach achieves performance similar to or better than full-data training. Notably, it outperforms the full-data model on certain metrics and performs only slightly worse on others while using only 20% of the training data. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for weather forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.</description>

      <title>An Advanced Convolutional Neural Network for Bearing Fault Diagnosis under Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the area of bearing fault diagnosis, deep learning (DL) methods have been widely used recently. However, due to the high cost or privacy concerns, high-quality labeled data are scarce in real world scenarios. While few-shot learning has shown promise in addressing data scarcity, existing methods still face significant limitations in this domain. Traditional data augmentation techniques often suffer from mode collapse and generate low-quality samples that fail to capture the diversity of bearing fault patterns. Moreover, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields makes them inadequate for extracting global features from complex vibration signals. Additionally, existing methods fail to model the intricate relationships between limited training samples. To solve these problems, we propose an advanced data augmentation and contrastive fourier convolution framework (DAC-FCF) for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data. Firstly, a novel conditional consistent latent representation and reconstruction generative adversarial network (CCLR-GAN) is proposed to generate more diverse data. Secondly, a contrastive learning based joint optimization mechanism is utilized to better model the relations between the available training data. Finally, we propose a 1D fourier convolution neural network (1D-FCNN) to achieve a global-aware of the input data. Experiments demonstrate that DAC-FCF achieves significant improvements, outperforming baselines by up to 32\% on case western reserve university (CWRU) dataset and 10\% on a self-collected test bench. Extensive ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed components. Thus, the proposed DAC-FCF offers a promising solution for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-based equipment condition monitoring suffers from a lack of standardized methodologies for algorithm selection, hindering reproducible research. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive framework for the systematic and statistically rigorous evaluation of machine learning models. Leveraging a rich 127-feature set across time, frequency, and time-frequency domains, our methodology is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that an ensemble method achieves superior performance (94.2% accuracy, 0.942 F1-score), with statistical testing confirming its significant outperformance of individual algorithms by 8-15%. Ultimately, this work provides a validated benchmarking protocol and practical guidelines for selecting robust monitoring solutions in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>DemandLens: Enhancing Forecast Accuracy Through Product-Specific Hyperparameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DemandLens demonstrates an innovative Prophet based forecasting model for the mattress-in-a-box industry, incorporating COVID-19 metrics and SKU-specific hyperparameter optimization. This industry has seen significant growth of E-commerce players in the recent years, wherein the business model majorly relies on outsourcing Mattress manufacturing and related logistics and supply chain operations, focusing on marketing the product and driving conversions through Direct-to-Consumer sales channels. Now, within the United States, there are a limited number of Mattress contract manufacturers available, and hence, it is important that they manage their raw materials, supply chain, and, inventory intelligently, to be able to cater maximum Mattress brands. Our approach addresses the critical need for accurate Sales Forecasting in an industry that is heavily dependent on third-party Contract Manufacturing. This, in turn, helps the contract manufacturers to be prepared, hence, avoiding bottleneck scenarios, and aiding them to source raw materials at optimal rates. The model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities through SKU-specific Hyperparameter optimization, offering the Contract Manufacturers and Mattress brands a reliable tool to streamline supply chain operations.</description>

      <title>GCN-TULHOR: Trajectory-User Linking Leveraging GCNs and Higher-Order Spatial Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory-user linking (TUL) aims to associate anonymized trajectories with the users who generated them, which is crucial for personalized recommendations, privacy-preserving analytics, and secure location-based services. Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations, mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest. Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data. This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.</description>

      <title>BIGNet: Pretrained Graph Neural Network for Embedding Semantic, Spatial, and Topological Data in BIM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in civil engineering, but they primarily focus on textual and visual data, overlooking the rich semantic, spatial, and topological features in BIM (Building Information Modelling) models. Therefore, this study develops the first large-scale graph neural network (GNN), BIGNet, to learn, and reuse multidimensional design features embedded in BIM models. Firstly, a scalable graph representation is introduced to encode the "semantic-spatial-topological" features of BIM components, and a dataset with nearly 1 million nodes and 3.5 million edges is created. Subsequently, BIGNet is proposed by introducing a new message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2 and further pretrained with a node masking strategy. Finally, BIGNet is evaluated in various transfer learning tasks for BIM-based design checking. Results show that: 1) homogeneous graph representation outperforms heterogeneous graph in learning design features, 2) considering local spatial relationships in a 30 cm radius enhances performance, and 3) BIGNet with GAT (Graph Attention Network)-based feature extraction achieves the best transfer learning results. This innovation leads to a 72.7% improvement in Average F1-score over non-pretrained models, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning and transferring BIM design features and facilitating their automated application in future design and lifecycle management.</description>

      <title>Agentic Username Suggestion and Multimodal Gender Detection in Online Platforms: Introducing the PNGT-26K Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persian names present unique challenges for natural language processing applications, particularly in gender detection and digital identity creation, due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns. Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names, while the scarcity of comprehensive datasets further compounds these limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000 tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open Gender Detection is a production-grade, ready-to-use framework for using existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username for their social media accounts on any platform. It can be easily integrated into any website to provide a better user experience. The PNGT-26K dataset, Nominalist and Open Gender Detection frameworks are publicly available on Github.</description>

Abstract: Feature space topology refers to the organization of samples within the feature space. Modifying this topology can be beneficial in machine learning applications, including dimensionality reduction, generative modeling, transfer learning, and robustness to adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel loss function, Hopkins loss, which leverages the Hopkins statistic to enforce a desired feature space topology, which is in contrast to existing topology-related methods that aim to preserve input feature topology. We evaluate the effectiveness of Hopkins loss on speech, text, and image data in two scenarios: classification and dimensionality reduction using nonlinear bottleneck autoencoders. Our experiments show that integrating Hopkins loss into classification or dimensionality reduction has only a small impact on classification performance while providing the benefit of modifying feature topology.</description>

      <title>AQUA: Attention via QUery mAgnitudes for Memory and Compute Efficient Inference in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Data-Free Model Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model extraction is a severe threat to Machine Learning-as-a-Service systems, especially through data-free approaches, where dishonest users can replicate the functionality of a black-box target model without access to realistic data. Despite recent advancements, existing data-free model extraction methods suffer from the oscillating accuracy of the substitute model. This oscillation, which could be attributed to the constant shift in the generated data distribution during the attack, makes the attack impractical since the optimal substitute model cannot be determined without access to the target model's in-distribution data. Hence, we propose MetaDFME, a novel data-free model extraction method that employs meta-learning in the generator training to reduce the distribution shift, aiming to mitigate the substitute model's accuracy oscillation. In detail, we train our generator to iteratively capture the meta-representations of the synthetic data during the attack. These meta-representations can be adapted with a few steps to produce data that facilitates the substitute model to learn from the target model while reducing the effect of distribution shifts. Our experiments on popular baseline image datasets, MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that MetaDFME outperforms the current state-of-the-art data-free model extraction method while exhibiting a more stable substitute model's accuracy during the attack.</description>

      <title>GK-SMOTE: A Hyperparameter-free Noise-Resilient Gaussian KDE-Based Oversampling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imbalanced classification is a significant challenge in machine learning, especially in critical applications like medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and cybersecurity. Traditional oversampling techniques, such as SMOTE, often fail to handle label noise and complex data distributions, leading to reduced classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose GK-SMOTE, a hyperparameter-free, noise-resilient extension of SMOTE, built on Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). GK-SMOTE enhances class separability by generating synthetic samples in high-density minority regions, while effectively avoiding noisy or ambiguous areas. This self-adaptive approach uses Gaussian KDE to differentiate between safe and noisy regions, ensuring more accurate sample generation without requiring extensive parameter tuning. Our extensive experiments on diverse binary classification datasets demonstrate that GK-SMOTE outperforms existing state-of-the-art oversampling techniques across key evaluation metrics, including MCC, Balanced Accuracy, and AUPRC. The proposed method offers a robust, efficient solution for imbalanced classification tasks, especially in noisy data environments, making it an attractive choice for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Optimization Dynamics for Curvature-Informed Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging is an effective post-training strategy for composing capabilities in large language models without joint retraining. We study this in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, where multiple capability-based SFT checkpoints -- spanning math, code, precise instruction following, general instruction following, and knowledge recall -- must be consolidated into a single model. We introduce Optimization Trajectory Aware (OTA) Merging, a curvature-aware aggregation that leverages optimizer second-moment statistics as a diagonal curvature proxy to reweight parameter edits and mitigate interference. Complementing OTA, we propose Fast Fisher Grafting (FFG), a curvature-driven task-localization step that sparsifies conflicting or low-importance edits. FFG induces extremely low-rank masks concentrated in early attention query/key projections and token embeddings, exploiting shared curvature across capabilities. We further develop a memory-light compression of the second moments that preserves OTA's effect. Across diverse capability-based SFT checkpoints, OTA+FFG improves merged-model quality over strong weight-space baselines, reduces negative transfer, and remains robust across sparsity levels. Analyses reveal substantial curvature overlap between checkpoints, offering a novel lens on why simple linear merging can be effective in practice. Ablations confirm that FFG is critical for reducing task interference and that the compressed second moments retain the gains of the full formulation. To facilitate reproducibility, we open-source all code, training and evaluation scripts, visualization artifacts, and capability-specific SFT checkpoints at https://github.com/pmahdavi/ota-merge.</description>

      <title>Federated Recommender System with Data Valuation for E-commerce Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is gaining prominence in machine learning as privacy concerns grow. This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online store) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model updates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby preserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing FL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data, despite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to enrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this end, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform collaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender system. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item lists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or locally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of sparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional challenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and irrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively augments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the global dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract global structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess client-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability estimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions. FedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL environments.</description>

      <title>Foundational theory for optimal decision tree problems. I. Algorithmic and geometric foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first paper (part I) of this series of two, we introduce four novel definitions of the ODT problems: three for size-constrained trees and one for depth-constrained trees. These definitions are stated unambiguously through executable recursive programs, satisfying all criteria we propose for a formal specification. In this sense, they resemble the "standard form" used in the study of general-purpose solvers.
  Grounded in algebraic programming theory-a relational formalism for deriving correct-by-construction algorithms from specifications-we can not only establish the existence or nonexistence of dynamic programming solutions but also derive them constructively whenever they exist. Consequently, the four generic problem definitions yield four novel optimal algorithms for ODT problems with arbitrary splitting rules that satisfy the axioms and objective functions of a given form. These algorithms encompass the known depth-constrained, axis-parallel ODT algorithm as the special case, while providing a unified, efficient, and elegant solution for the general ODT problem.
  In Part II, we present the first optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm and provide comprehensive experiments against axis-parallel decision tree algorithms, including heuristic CART and state-of-the-art optimal methods. The results demonstrate the significant potential of decision trees with flexible splitting rules. Moreover, our framework is readily extendable to support algorithms for constructing even more flexible decision trees, including those with mixed splitting rules.</description>

      <title>TransZero: Parallel Tree Expansion in MuZero using Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TransZero, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that removes the sequential bottleneck in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Unlike MuZero, which constructs its search tree step by step using a recurrent dynamics model, TransZero employs a transformer-based network to generate multiple latent future states simultaneously. Combined with the Mean-Variance Constrained (MVC) evaluator that eliminates dependence on inherently sequential visitation counts, our approach enables the parallel expansion of entire subtrees during planning. Experiments in MiniGrid and LunarLander show that TransZero achieves up to an eleven-fold speedup in wall-clock time compared to MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency. These results demonstrate that parallel tree construction can substantially accelerate model-based reinforcement learning, bringing real-time decision-making in complex environments closer to practice. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization on Hadamard Manifolds: Curvature Independent Regret Bounds on Horospherically Convex Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online Riemannian optimization on Hadamard manifolds under the framework of horospherical convexity (h-convexity). Prior work mostly relies on the geodesic convexity (g-convexity), leading to regret bounds scaling poorly with the manifold curvature. To address this limitation, we analyze Riemannian online gradient descent for h-convex and strongly h-convex functions and establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\log(T))$ regret guarantees, respectively. These bounds are curvature-independent and match the results in the Euclidean setting. We validate our approach with experiments on the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices equipped with the affine-invariant metric. In particular, we investigate online Tyler's $M$-estimation and online Fr\'echet mean computation, showing the application of h-convexity in practice.</description>

      <title>Gradient Free Deep Reinforcement Learning With TabPFN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient based optimization is fundamental to most modern deep reinforcement learning algorithms, however, it introduces significant sensitivity to hyperparameters, unstable training dynamics, and high computational costs. We propose TabPFN RL, a novel gradient free deep RL framework that repurposes the meta trained transformer TabPFN as a Q function approximator. Originally developed for tabular classification, TabPFN is a transformer pre trained on millions of synthetic datasets to perform inference on new unseen datasets via in context learning. Given an in context dataset of sample label pairs and new unlabeled data, it predicts the most likely labels in a single forward pass, without gradient updates or task specific fine tuning. We use TabPFN to predict Q values using inference only, thereby eliminating the need for back propagation at both training and inference. To cope with the model's fixed context budget, we design a high reward episode gate that retains only the top 5% of trajectories. Empirical evaluations on the Gymnasium classic control suite demonstrate that TabPFN RL matches or surpasses Deep Q Network on CartPole v1, MountainCar v0, and Acrobot v1, without applying gradient descent or any extensive hyperparameter tuning. We discuss the theoretical aspects of how bootstrapped targets and non stationary visitation distributions violate the independence assumptions encoded in TabPFN's prior, yet the model retains a surprising generalization capacity. We further formalize the intrinsic context size limit of in context RL algorithms and propose principled truncation strategies that enable continual learning when the context is full. Our results establish prior fitted networks such as TabPFN as a viable foundation for fast and computationally efficient RL, opening new directions for gradient free RL with large pre trained transformers.</description>

      <title>SelectMix: Enhancing Label Noise Robustness through Targeted Sample Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks tend to memorize noisy labels, severely degrading their generalization performance. Although Mixup has demonstrated effectiveness in improving generalization and robustness, existing Mixup-based methods typically perform indiscriminate mixing without principled guidance on sample selection and mixing strategy, inadvertently propagating noisy supervision. To overcome these limitations, we propose SelectMix, a confidence-guided mixing framework explicitly tailored for noisy labels. SelectMix first identifies potentially noisy or ambiguous samples through confidence based mismatch analysis using K-fold cross-validation, then selectively blends identified uncertain samples with confidently predicted peers from their potential classes. Furthermore, SelectMix employs soft labels derived from all classes involved in the mixing process, ensuring the labels accurately represent the composition of the mixed samples, thus aligning supervision signals closely with the actual mixed inputs. Through extensive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world benchmark datasets (CIFAR-N, MNIST and Clothing1M), we demonstrate that SelectMix consistently outperforms strong baseline methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness in learning with noisy labels.</description>

      <title>PINGS: Physics-Informed Neural Network for Fast Generative Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PINGS (Physics-Informed Neural Network for Fast Generative Sampling), a framework that amortizes diffusion sampling by training a physics-informed network to approximate reverse-time probability-flow dynamics, reducing sampling to a single forward pass (NFE = 1). As a proof of concept, we learn a direct map from a 3D standard normal to a non-Gaussian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). PINGS preserves the target's distributional structure (multi-bandwidth kernel $MMD^2 = 1.88 \times 10^{-2}$ with small errors in mean, covariance, skewness, and excess kurtosis) and achieves constant-time generation: $10^4$ samples in $16.54 \pm 0.56$ millisecond on an RTX 3090, versus 468-843 millisecond for DPM-Solver (10/20) and 960 millisecond for DDIM (50) under matched conditions. We also sanity-check the PINN/automatic-differentiation pipeline on a damped harmonic oscillator, obtaining MSEs down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. Compared to fast but iterative ODE solvers and direct-map families (Flow, Rectified-Flow, Consistency), PINGS frames generative sampling as a PINN-style residual problem with endpoint anchoring, yielding a white-box, differentiable map with NFE = 1. These proof-of-concept results position PINGS as a promising route to fast, function-based generative sampling with potential extensions to scientific simulation (e.g., fast calorimetry).</description>

      <title>Efficient Single-Step Framework for Incremental Class Learning in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incremental learning remains a critical challenge in machine learning, as models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting -the tendency to lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. These challenges are even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class Incremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually adapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial computational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work introduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach that addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable solution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several existing, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature extractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer neural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor eliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This, combined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to perform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization process on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time without requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the classifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing state-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and sustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making class-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with limited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are available.</description>

      <title>Opal: An Operator Algebra View of RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed, penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins. When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates, score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility.
  Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and, when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization, canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses when assumptions fail.
  We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and adapters for DPO and RRHF.</description>

      <title>MatQnA: A Benchmark Dataset for Multi-modal Large Language Models in Materials Characterization and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in general domains such as programming and writing, and have demonstrated strong potential in various scientific research scenarios. However, the capabilities of AI models in the highly specialized field of materials characterization and analysis have not yet been systematically or sufficiently validated. To address this gap, we present MatQnA, the first multi-modal benchmark dataset specifically designed for material characterization techniques. MatQnA includes ten mainstream characterization methods, such as X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), etc. We employ a hybrid approach combining LLMs with human-in-the-loop validation to construct high-quality question-answer pairs, integrating both multiple-choice and subjective questions. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the most advanced multi-modal AI models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Doubao Vision Pro 32K) have already achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks, demonstrating strong potential for applications in materials characterization and analysis. The MatQnA dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/richardhzgg/matQnA.</description>

      <title>On the Escaping Efficiency of Distributed Adversarial Training Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training has been widely studied in recent years due to its role in improving model robustness against adversarial attacks. This paper focuses on comparing different distributed adversarial training algorithms--including centralized and decentralized strategies--within multi-agent learning environments. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of model flatness in determining robustness. To this end, we develop a general theoretical framework to study the escaping efficiency of these algorithms from local minima, which is closely related to the flatness of the resulting models. We show that when the perturbation bound is sufficiently small (i.e., when the attack strength is relatively mild) and a large batch size is used, decentralized adversarial training algorithms--including consensus and diffusion--are guaranteed to escape faster from local minima than the centralized strategy, thereby favoring flatter minima. However, as the perturbation bound increases, this trend may no longer hold. In the simulation results, we illustrate our theoretical findings and systematically compare the performance of models obtained through decentralized and centralized adversarial training algorithms. The results highlight the potential of decentralized strategies to enhance the robustness of models in distributed settings.</description>

      <title>BiLSTM-VHP: BiLSTM-Powered Network for Viral Host Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recorded history shows the long coexistence of humans and animals, suggesting it began much earlier. Despite some beneficial interdependence, many animals carry viral diseases that can spread to humans. These diseases are known as zoonotic diseases. Recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, Monkeypox and swine flu viruses have shown how these viruses can disrupt human life and cause death. Fast and accurate predictions of the host from which the virus spreads can help prevent these diseases from spreading. This work presents BiLSTM-VHP, a lightweight bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based architecture that can predict the host from the nucleotide sequence of orthohantavirus, rabies lyssavirus, and rotavirus A with high accuracy. The proposed model works with nucleotide sequences of 400 bases in length and achieved a prediction accuracy of 89.62% for orthohantavirus, 96.58% for rotavirus A, and 77.22% for rabies lyssavirus outperforming previous studies. Moreover, performance of the model is assessed using the confusion matrix, F-1 score, precision, recall, microaverage AUC. In addition, we introduce three curated datasets of orthohantavirus, rotavirus A, and rabies lyssavirus containing 8,575, 95,197, and 22,052 nucleotide sequences divided into 9, 12, and 29 host classes, respectively. The codes and dataset are available at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ANFKR</description>

      <title>On Linear Mode Connectivity of Mixture-of-Experts Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) is a notable phenomenon in the loss landscapes of neural networks, wherein independently trained models have been observed to be connected--up to permutation symmetries--by linear paths in parameter space along which the loss remains consistently low. This observation challenges classical views of non-convex optimization and has implications for model ensembling, generalization, and our understanding of neural loss geometry. Inspired by recent studies on LMC in standard neural networks, we systematically investigate this phenomenon within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures--a class of models known for their scalability and computational efficiency, which combine traditional neural networks--referred to as experts--through a learnable gating mechanism. We begin by conducting a comprehensive analysis of both dense and sparse gating regimes, demonstrating that the symmetries inherent to MoE architectures are fully characterized by permutations acting on both the expert components and the gating function. Building on these foundational findings, we propose a matching algorithm that enables alignment between independently trained MoEs, thereby facilitating the discovery of LMC. Finally, we empirically validate the presence of LMC using our proposed algorithm across diverse MoE configurations--including dense, sparse, and shared-expert variants--under a wide range of model settings and datasets of varying scales and modalities. Our results confirm the existence of LMC in MoE architectures and offer fundamental insights into the functional landscape and optimization dynamics of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Online Omniprediction with Long-Term Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the problem of online omniprediction with long-term constraints. At each round, a forecaster is tasked with generating predictions for an underlying (adaptively, adversarially chosen) state that are broadcast to a collection of downstream agents, who must each choose an action. Each of the downstream agents has both a utility function mapping actions and state to utilities, and a vector-valued constraint function mapping actions and states to vector-valued costs. The utility and constraint functions can arbitrarily differ across downstream agents. Their goal is to choose actions that guarantee themselves no regret while simultaneously guaranteeing that they do not cumulatively violate the constraints across time. We show how to make a single set of predictions so that each of the downstream agents can guarantee this by acting as a simple function of the predictions, guaranteeing each of them $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(1)$ cumulative constraint violation. We also show how to extend our guarantees to arbitrary intersecting contextually defined \emph{subsequences}, guaranteeing each agent both regret and constraint violation bounds not just marginally, but simultaneously on each subsequence, against a benchmark set of actions simultaneously tailored to each subsequence.</description>

      <title>PersonaX: Multimodal Datasets with LLM-Inferred Behavior Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Detecting Model Drifts in Non-Stationary Environment Using Edit Operation Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically assume stationary environment dynamics. Yet in real-world applications such as healthcare, robotics, and finance, transition probabilities or reward functions may evolve, leading to model drift. This paper proposes a novel framework to detect such drifts by analyzing the distributional changes in sequences of agent behavior. Specifically, we introduce a suite of edit operation-based measures to quantify deviations between state-action trajectories generated under stationary and perturbed conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that these measures can effectively distinguish drifted from non-drifted scenarios, even under varying levels of noise, providing a practical tool for drift detection in non-stationary RL environments.</description>

      <title>Decoding Musical Origins: Distinguishing Human and AI Composers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI-driven music generation has become a vibrant and fruitful area of research. However, the representation of musical data remains a significant challenge. To address this, a novel, machine-learning-friendly music notation system, YNote, was developed. This study leverages YNote to train an effective classification model capable of distinguishing whether a piece of music was composed by a human (Native), a rule-based algorithm (Algorithm Generated), or an LLM (LLM Generated). We frame this as a text classification problem, applying the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm to extract structural features from YNote sequences and using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address data imbalance. The resulting model achieves an accuracy of 98.25%, successfully demonstrating that YNote retains sufficient stylistic information for analysis. More importantly, the model can identify the unique " technological fingerprints " left by different AI generation techniques, providing a powerful tool for tracing the origins of AI-generated content.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reservoir Decision Support: An Integrated Framework Combining Large Language Models, Advanced Prompt Engineering, and Multimodal Data Fusion for Real-Time Petroleum Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The petroleum industry faces unprecedented challenges in reservoir management, requiring rapid integration of complex multimodal datasets for real-time decision support. This study presents a novel integrated framework combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with advanced prompt engineering techniques and multimodal data fusion for comprehensive reservoir analysis. The framework implements domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with over 50,000 petroleum engineering documents, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot learning for rapid field adaptation. Multimodal integration processes seismic interpretations, well logs, and production data through specialized AI models with vision transformers. Field validation across 15 diverse reservoir environments demonstrates exceptional performance: 94.2% reservoir characterization accuracy, 87.6% production forecasting precision, and 91.4% well placement optimization success rate. The system achieves sub-second response times while maintaining 96.2% safety reliability with no high-risk incidents during evaluation. Economic analysis reveals 62-78% cost reductions (mean 72%) relative to traditional methods with 8-month payback period. Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt optimization achieves 89% improvement in reasoning quality. The framework processed real-time data streams with 96.2% anomaly detection accuracy and reduced environmental incidents by 45%. We provide detailed experimental protocols, baseline comparisons, ablation studies, and statistical significance testing to ensure reproducibility. This research demonstrates practical integration of cutting-edge AI technologies with petroleum domain expertise for enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and economic performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing ML Models Interpretability for Credit Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting default is essential for banks to ensure profitability and financial stability. While modern machine learning methods often outperform traditional regression techniques, their lack of transparency limits their use in regulated environments. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a solution in domains like credit scoring. However, most XAI research focuses on post-hoc interpretation of black-box models, which does not produce models lightweight or transparent enough to meet regulatory requirements, such as those for Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) models.
  This paper proposes a hybrid approach: post-hoc interpretations of black-box models guide feature selection, followed by training glass-box models that maintain both predictive power and transparency.
  Using the Lending Club dataset, we demonstrate that this approach achieves performance comparable to a benchmark black-box model while using only 10 features - an 88.5% reduction. In our example, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used for feature selection, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) serves as the benchmark and the base black-box model, and Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) and Penalized Logistic Tree Regression (PLTR) are the investigated glass-box models.
  We also show that model refinement using feature interaction analysis, correlation checks, and expert input can further enhance model interpretability and robustness.</description>

      <title>From Firewalls to Frontiers: AI Red-Teaming is a Domain-Specific Evolution of Cyber Red-Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A red team simulates adversary attacks to help defenders find effective strategies to defend their systems in a real-world operational setting. As more enterprise systems adopt AI, red-teaming will need to evolve to address the unique vulnerabilities and risks posed by AI systems. We take the position that AI systems can be more effectively red-teamed if AI red-teaming is recognized as a domain-specific evolution of cyber red-teaming. Specifically, we argue that existing Cyber Red Teams who adopt this framing will be able to better evaluate systems with AI components by recognizing that AI poses new risks, has new failure modes to exploit, and often contains unpatchable bugs that re-prioritize disclosure and mitigation strategies. Similarly, adopting a cybersecurity framing will allow existing AI Red Teams to leverage a well-tested structure to emulate realistic adversaries, promote mutual accountability with formal rules of engagement, and provide a pattern to mature the tooling necessary for repeatable, scalable engagements. In these ways, the merging of AI and Cyber Red Teams will create a robust security ecosystem and best position the community to adapt to the rapidly changing threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Framing AI System Benchmarking as a Learning Task: FlexBench and the Open MLPerf Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing AI system benchmarks such as MLPerf often struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving AI landscape, making it difficult to support informed deployment, optimization, and co-design decisions for AI systems. We suggest that benchmarking itself can be framed as an AI task - one in which models are continuously evaluated and optimized across diverse datasets, software, and hardware, using key metrics such as accuracy, latency, throughput, energy consumption, and cost. To support this perspective, we present FlexBench: a modular extension of the MLPerf LLM inference benchmark, integrated with HuggingFace and designed to provide relevant and actionable insights. Benchmarking results and metadata are collected into an Open MLPerf Dataset, which can be collaboratively curated, extended, and leveraged for predictive modeling and feature engineering. We successfully validated the FlexBench concept through MLPerf Inference submissions, including evaluations of DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.3 on commodity servers. The broader objective is to enable practitioners to make cost-effective AI deployment decisions that reflect their available resources, requirements, and constraints.</description>

      <title>Long-time dynamics and universality of nonconvex gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a general approach to characterize the long-time trajectory behavior of nonconvex gradient descent in generalized single-index models in the large aspect ratio regime. In this regime, we show that for each iteration the gradient descent iterate concentrates around a deterministic vector called the `Gaussian theoretical gradient descent', whose dynamics can be tracked by a state evolution system of two recursive equations for two scalars. Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of design matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic convergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient descent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and strongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as the `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models under Gaussian data.
  As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two applications of different natures in the regression setting. In the first, we prove global convergence of nonconvex gradient descent with general independent initialization for a broad class of structured link functions, and establish universality of randomly initialized gradient descent in phase retrieval for large aspect ratios. In the second, we develop a data-free iterative algorithm for estimating state evolution parameters along the entire gradient descent trajectory, thereby providing a low-cost yet statistically valid tool for practical tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and runtime determination.
  As a by-product of our analysis, we show that in the large aspect ratio regime, the Gaussian theoretical gradient descent coincides with a recent line of dynamical mean-field theory for gradient descent over the constant-time horizon.</description>

After filtering for electric-only vehicles, 23,301 EV-involved crash records were analyzed. Feature importance techniques using XGBoost and Random Forest identified intersection relation, first harmful event, person age, crash speed limit, and day of week as the top predictors, along with advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking. To address class imbalance, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEENN) resampling was applied. Three state-of-the-art deep tabular models, TabPFN, MambaNet, and MambaAttention, were benchmarked for severity prediction. While TabPFN demonstrated strong generalization, MambaAttention achieved superior performance in classifying severe injury cases due to its attention-based feature reweighting. The findings highlight the potential of deep tabular architectures for improving crash severity prediction and enabling data-driven safety interventions in EV crash contexts.</description>

      <title>Learning to Optimize Multi-Objective Alignment Through Dynamic Reward Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior works in multi-objective reinforcement learning typically use linear reward scalarization with fixed weights, which provably fail to capture non-convex Pareto fronts and thus yield suboptimal results. This limitation becomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language models. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies create highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives that no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address this limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively adjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike existing approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic weighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training, facilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We introduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1) hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight optimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with commonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO, REINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear scalarization baselines.</description>

      <title>Drug Repurposing Using Deep Embedded Clustering and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug repurposing has historically been an economically infeasible process for identifying novel uses for abandoned drugs. Modern machine learning has enabled the identification of complex biochemical intricacies in candidate drugs; however, many studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease similarities. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses unsupervised deep embedded clustering, combined with supervised graph neural network link prediction to identify new drug-disease links from multi-omic data. Unsupervised autoencoder and cluster training reduced the dimensionality of omic data into a compressed latent embedding. A total of 9,022 unique drugs were partitioned into 35 clusters with a mean silhouette score of 0.8550. Graph neural networks achieved strong statistical performance, with a prediction accuracy of 0.901, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.960, and F1-Score of 0.901. A ranked list comprised of 477 per-cluster link probabilities exceeding 99 percent was generated. This study could provide new drug-disease link prospects across unrelated disease domains, while advancing the understanding of machine learning in drug repurposing studies.</description>

      <title>OASIS: A Deep Learning Framework for Universal Spectroscopic Analysis Driven by Novel Loss Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of spectroscopic data across various scientific and engineering fields necessitates automated processing. We introduce OASIS (Omni-purpose Analysis of Spectra via Intelligent Systems), a machine learning (ML) framework for technique-independent, automated spectral analysis, encompassing denoising, baseline correction, and comprehensive peak parameter (location, intensity, FWHM) retrieval without human intervention. OASIS achieves its versatility through models trained on a strategically designed synthetic dataset incorporating features from numerous spectroscopy techniques. Critically, the development of innovative, task-specific loss functions-such as the vicinity peak response (ViPeR) for peak localization-enabled the creation of compact yet highly accurate models from this dataset, validated with experimental data from Raman, UV-vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. OASIS demonstrates significant potential for applications including in situ experiments, high-throughput optimization, and online monitoring. This study underscores the optimization of the loss function as a key resource-efficient strategy to develop high-performance ML models.</description>

      <title>Know What You Don't Know: Selective Prediction for Early Exit DNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference latency and trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the bottlenecks in deploying them in critical applications like sensitive tasks. Early Exit (EE) DNNs overcome the latency issues by allowing samples to exit from intermediary layers if they attain `high' confidence scores on the predicted class. However, the DNNs are known to exhibit overconfidence, which can lead to many samples exiting early and render EE strategies untrustworthy. We use Selective Prediction (SP) to overcome this issue by checking the `hardness' of the samples rather than just relying on the confidence score alone. We propose SPEED, a novel approach that uses Deferral Classifiers (DCs) at each layer to check the hardness of samples before performing EEs. Specifically, the DCs identify if a sample is hard to predict at an intermediary layer, leading to hallucination, and defer it to an expert. Early detection of hard samples for inference prevents the wastage of computational resources and improves trust by deferring the hard samples to the expert. We demonstrate that EE aided with SP improves both accuracy and latency. Our method minimizes the risk of wrong prediction by $50\%$ with a speedup of $2.05\times$ as compared to the final layer.

      <title>DARD: Dice Adversarial Robustness Distillation against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing critical security challenges in real-world applications. While Adversarial Training (AT ) is a widely adopted defense mechanism to enhance robustness, it often incurs a trade-off by degrading performance on unperturbed, natural data. Recent efforts have highlighted that larger models exhibit enhanced robustness over their smaller counterparts. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that such robustness can be systematically distilled from large teacher models into compact student models. To achieve better performance, we introduce Dice Adversarial Robustness Distillation (DARD), a novel method designed to transfer robustness through a tailored knowledge distillation paradigm. Additionally, we propose Dice Projected Gradient Descent (DPGD), an adversarial example generalization method optimized for effective attack. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the DARD approach consistently outperforms adversarially trained networks with the same architecture, achieving superior robustness and standard accuracy.</description>

      <title>UI-S1: Advancing GUI Automation via Semi-online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance (SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent/tree/main/UI-S1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressed sensing is a signal processing technique that allows for the reconstruction of a signal from a small set of measurements. The key idea behind compressed sensing is that many real-world signals are inherently sparse, meaning that they can be efficiently represented in a different space with only a few components compared to their original space representation. In this paper we will explore the mathematical formulation behind compressed sensing, its logic and pathologies, and apply compressed sensing to real world signals.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Adaptive Parsing of Temporal and Cross-Variable Patterns for Network State Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective network state classification is a primary task for ensuring network security and optimizing performance. Existing deep learning models have shown considerable progress in this area. Some methods excel at analyzing the complex temporal periodicities found in traffic data, while graph-based approaches are adept at modeling the dynamic dependencies between different variables. However, a key trade-off remains, as these methods struggle to capture both characteristics simultaneously. Models focused on temporal patterns often overlook crucial variable dependencies, whereas those centered on dependencies may fail to capture fine-grained temporal details. To address this trade-off, we introduce DAPNet, a framework based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture. DAPNet integrates three specialized networks for periodic analysis, dynamic cross-variable correlation modeling, and hybrid temporal feature extraction. A learnable gating network dynamically assigns weights to experts based on the input sample and computes a weighted fusion of their outputs. Furthermore, a hybrid regularization loss function ensures stable training and addresses the common issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale network intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017/2018) validate DAPNet's higher accuracy for its target application. The generalizability of the architectural design is evaluated across ten public UEA benchmark datasets, positioning DAPNet as a specialized framework for network state classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir is an efficient network for time series processing. It is well known that network structure is one of the determinants of its performance. However, the topology structure of reservoirs, as well as their performance, is hard to analyzed, due to the lack of suitable mathematical tools. In this paper, we study the topology structure of reservoirs using persistent GLMY homology theory, and develop a method to improve its performance. Specifically, it is found that the reservoir performance is closely related to the one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Then, we develop a reservoir structure optimization method by modifying the minimal representative cycles of one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Finally, by experiments, it is validated that the performance of reservoirs is jointly influenced by the reservoir structure and the periodicity of the dataset.</description>

      <title>Inducing Uncertainty for Test-Time Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlearning is the predominant method for removing the influence of data in machine learning models. However, even after unlearning, models often continue to produce the same predictions on the unlearned data with high confidence. This persistent behavior can be exploited by adversaries using confident model predictions on incorrect or obsolete data to harm users. We call this threat model, which unlearning fails to protect against, *test-time privacy*. In particular, an adversary with full model access can bypass any naive defenses which ensure test-time privacy. To address this threat, we introduce an algorithm which perturbs model weights to induce maximal uncertainty on protected instances while preserving accuracy on the rest of the instances. Our core algorithm is based on finetuning with a Pareto optimal objective that explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight, non-vacuous bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms incur. Empirically, our method obtains $&gt;3\times$ stronger uncertainty than pretraining with $&lt;0.2\%$ drops in accuracy on various image recognition benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional protection to end users.</description>

      <title>SpeCa: Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Speculative Feature Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify' acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models, predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability, enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances. Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios. Our codes have been released in Github: \textbf{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/Cache4Diffusion}</description>

      <title>Reasoned Safety Alignment: Ensuring Jailbreak Defense via Answer-Then-Check</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, ensuring their safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check, which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to the user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their thought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety Alignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason through direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety capability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks. Notably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our method equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike post-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm). Furthermore, we discover that training on a small subset of just 500 examples can achieve comparable performance to using the full dataset, suggesting that safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Adaptive-GraphSketch: Real-Time Edge Anomaly Detection via Multi-Layer Tensor Sketching and Temporal Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs is essential for identifying malicious activities, fraud, and unexpected behaviors in real-world systems such as cybersecurity and power grids. However, existing approaches struggle with scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight and scalable framework for real-time anomaly detection in streaming edge data. Our method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns with bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues. We incorporate Bayesian inference for probabilistic anomaly scoring and apply Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for adaptive thresholding tuned to burst intensity. Extensive experiments on four real-world intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as ANOEDGE-G/L, MIDAS-R, and F-FADE, achieving up to 6.5% AUC gain on CIC-IDS2018 and up to 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, while processing 20 million edges in under 3.4 seconds using only 10 hash functions. Our results show that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH is practical and effective for fast, accurate anomaly detection in large-scale streaming graphs.

      <title>Assessing On-the-Ground Disaster Impact Using Online Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the impact of a disaster in terms of asset losses and human casualties is essential for preparing effective response plans. Traditional methods include offline assessments conducted on the ground, where volunteers and first responders work together to collect the estimate of losses through windshield surveys or on-ground inspection. However, these methods have a time delay and are prone to different biases. Recently, various online data sources, including social media, news reports, aerial imagery, and satellite data, have been utilized to evaluate the impact of disasters. Online data sources provide real-time data streams for estimating the offline impact. Limited research exists on how different online sources help estimate disaster impact at a given administrative unit. In our work, we curate a comprehensive dataset by collecting data from multiple online sources for a few billion-dollar disasters at the county level. We also analyze how online estimates compare with traditional offline-based impact estimates for the disaster. Our findings provide insight into how different sources can provide complementary information to assess the disaster.</description>

      <title>Measuring Visual Understanding in Telecom domain: Performance Metrics for Image-to-UML conversion using VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telecom domain 3GPP documents are replete with images containing sequence diagrams. Advances in Vision-Language Large Models (VLMs) have eased conversion of such images to machine-readable PlantUML (puml) formats. However, there is a gap in evaluation of such conversions - existing works do not compare puml scripts for various components. In this work, we propose performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of such conversions. A dataset of sequence diagrams from 3GPP documents is chosen to be representative of domain-specific actual scenarios. We compare puml outputs from two VLMs - Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V - against manually created ground truth representations. We use version control tools to capture differences and introduce standard performance metrics to measure accuracies along various components: participant identification, message flow accuracy, sequence ordering, and grouping construct preservation. We demonstrate effectiveness of proposed metrics in quantifying conversion errors across various components of puml scripts. The results show that nodes, edges and messages are accurately captured. However, we observe that VLMs do not necessarily perform well on complex structures such as notes, box, groups. Our experiments and performance metrics indicates a need for better representation of these components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs.</description>

      <title>An Interventional Approach to Real-Time Disaster Assessment via Causal Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional disaster analysis and modelling tools for assessing the severity of a disaster are predictive in nature. Based on the past observational data, these tools prescribe how the current input state (e.g., environmental conditions, situation reports) results in a severity assessment. However, these systems are not meant to be interventional in the causal sense, where the user can modify the current input state to simulate counterfactual "what-if" scenarios. In this work, we provide an alternative interventional tool that complements traditional disaster modelling tools by leveraging real-time data sources like satellite imagery, news, and social media. Our tool also helps understand the causal attribution of different factors on the estimated severity, over any given region of interest. In addition, we provide actionable recourses that would enable easier mitigation planning. Our source code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Beyond Regularity: Modeling Chaotic Mobility Patterns for Next Location Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next location prediction is a key task in human mobility analysis, crucial for applications like smart city resource allocation and personalized navigation services. However, existing methods face two significant challenges: first, they fail to address the dynamic imbalance between periodic and chaotic mobile patterns, leading to inadequate adaptation over sparse trajectories; second, they underutilize contextual cues, such as temporal regularities in arrival times, which persist even in chaotic patterns and offer stronger predictability than spatial forecasts due to reduced search spaces. To tackle these challenges, we propose \textbf{\method}, a \underline{\textbf{C}}h\underline{\textbf{A}}otic \underline{\textbf{N}}eural \underline{\textbf{O}}scillator n\underline{\textbf{E}}twork for next location prediction, which introduces a biologically inspired Chaotic Neural Oscillatory Attention mechanism to inject adaptive variability into traditional attention, enabling balanced representation of evolving mobility behaviors, and employs a Tri-Pair Interaction Encoder along with a Cross Context Attentive Decoder to fuse multimodal ``who-when-where'' contexts in a joint framework for enhanced prediction performance. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that CANOE consistently and significantly outperforms a sizeable collection of state-of-the-art baselines, yielding 3.17\%-13.11\% improvement over the best-performing baselines across different cases. In particular, CANOE can make robust predictions over mobility trajectories of different mobility chaotic levels. A series of ablation studies also supports our key design choices.

      <title>DRAG: Data Reconstruction Attack using Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms for large models in SI scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/ntuaislab/DRAG.</description>

      <title>Fast and Interpretable Machine Learning Modelling of Atmospheric Molecular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how atmospheric molecular clusters form and grow is key to resolving one of the biggest uncertainties in climate modelling: the formation of new aerosol particles. While quantum chemistry offers accurate insights into these early-stage clusters, its steep computational costs limit large-scale exploration. In this work, we present a fast, interpretable, and surprisingly powerful alternative: $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$-NN) regression model. By leveraging chemically informed distance metrics, including a kernel-induced metric and one learned via metric learning for kernel regression (MLKR), we show that simple $k$-NN models can rival more complex kernel ridge regression (KRR) models in accuracy, while reducing computational time by orders of magnitude. We perform this comparison with the well-established Faber-Christensen-Huang-Lilienfeld (FCHL19) molecular descriptor, but other descriptors (e.g., FCHL18, MBDF, and CM) can be shown to have similar performance. Applied to both simple organic molecules in the QM9 benchmark set and large datasets of atmospheric molecular clusters (sulphuric acid-water and sulphuric-multibase -base systems), our $k$-NN models achieve near-chemical accuracy, scale seamlessly to datasets with over 250,000 entries, and even appears to extrapolate to larger unseen clusters with minimal error (often nearing 1 kcal/mol). With built-in interpretability and straightforward uncertainty estimation, this work positions $k$-NN as a potent tool for accelerating discovery in atmospheric chemistry and beyond.</description>

      <title>Data Fusion and Machine Learning for Ship Fuel Consumption Modelling -- A Case of Bulk Carrier Vessel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an increasing push for operational measures to reduce ships' bunker fuel consumption and carbon emissions, driven by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandates. Key performance indicators such as the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) focus on fuel efficiency. Strategies like trim optimization, virtual arrival, and green routing have emerged. The theoretical basis for these approaches lies in accurate prediction of fuel consumption as a function of sailing speed, displacement, trim, climate, and sea state. This study utilized 296 voyage reports from a bulk carrier vessel over one year (November 16, 2021 to November 21, 2022) and 28 parameters, integrating hydrometeorological big data from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) with 19 parameters and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with 61 parameters. The objective was to evaluate whether fusing external public data sources enhances modeling accuracy and to highlight the most influential parameters affecting fuel consumption. The results reveal a strong potential for machine learning techniques to predict ship fuel consumption accurately by combining voyage reports with climate and sea data. However, validation on similar classes of vessels remains necessary to confirm generalizability.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing PINNs: A regularization scheme for PINN training to avoid unstable fixed points of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown that the loss function used for training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) exhibits local minima at solutions corresponding to fixed points of dynamical systems. In the forward setting, where the PINN is trained to solve initial value problems, these local minima can interfere with training and potentially leading to physically incorrect solutions. Building on stability theory, this paper proposes a regularization scheme that penalizes solutions corresponding to unstable fixed points. Experimental results on four dynamical systems, including the Lotka-Volterra model and the van der Pol oscillator, show that our scheme helps avoiding physically incorrect solutions and substantially improves the training success rate of PINNs.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Regression for Enzyme Turnover Rates Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enzyme turnover rate is a fundamental parameter in enzyme kinetics, reflecting the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, enzyme turnover rates remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Watch Your Step: A Cost-Sensitive Framework for Accelerometer-Based Fall Detection in Real-World Streaming Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time fall detection is crucial for enabling timely interventions and mitigating the severe health consequences of falls, particularly in older adults. However, existing methods often rely on simulated data or assumptions such as prior knowledge of fall events, limiting their real-world applicability. Practical deployment also requires efficient computation and robust evaluation metrics tailored to continuous monitoring. This paper presents a real-time fall detection framework for continuous monitoring without prior knowledge of fall events. Using over 60 hours of inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from the FARSEEING real-world falls dataset, we employ recent efficient classifiers to compute fall probabilities in streaming mode. To enhance robustness, we introduce a cost-sensitive learning strategy that tunes the decision threshold using a cost function reflecting the higher risk of missed falls compared to false alarms. Unlike many methods that achieve high recall only at the cost of precision, our framework achieved Recall of 1.00, Precision of 0.84, and an F1 score of 0.91 on FARSEEING, detecting all falls while keeping false alarms low, with average inference time below 5 ms per sample. These results demonstrate that cost-sensitive threshold tuning enhances the robustness of accelerometer-based fall detection. They also highlight the potential of our computationally efficient framework for deployment in real-time wearable sensor systems for continuous monitoring.</description>

      <title>Visualization and Analysis of the Loss Landscape in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful models for graph-structured data, with broad applications. However, the interplay between GNN parameter optimization, expressivity, and generalization remains poorly understood. We address this by introducing an efficient learnable dimensionality reduction method for visualizing GNN loss landscapes, and by analyzing the effects of over-smoothing, jumping knowledge, quantization, sparsification, and preconditioner on GNN optimization. Our learnable projection method surpasses the state-of-the-art PCA-based approach, enabling accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional parameters with lower memory usage. We further show that architecture, sparsification, and optimizer's preconditioning significantly impact the GNN optimization landscape and their training process and final prediction performance. These insights contribute to developing more efficient designs of GNN architectures and training strategies.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Irrelevant Representations (CIR) Ensures Robust and Non-Disruptive LLM Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to remove dangerous knowledge from language models. We analyze the root causes and propose a highly selective technique which unlearns robustly and without disrupting general performance.
  We perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify subspaces containing common representations, and collapse them before calculating unlearning updates. This way we avoid unlearning general representations, and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.
  When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, we drop post-attack accuracy 80x more than our best baseline (Circuit Breakers) on biohazardous facts and 30x more on cyberhazardous facts. Despite this, we disrupt general performance 30x less (only 0.1% WikiText loss increase), while requiring less than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.</description>

      <title>FedDAF: Federated Domain Adaptation Using Model Functional Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a federated learning (FL) approach that improves model performance at the target client by collaborating with source clients while preserving data privacy. FDA faces two primary challenges: domain shifts between source and target data and limited labeled data at the target. Most existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts, assuming ample target data, yet often neglect the combined challenges of both domain shifts and data scarcity. Moreover, approaches that address both challenges fail to prioritize sharing relevant information from source clients according to the target's objective. In this paper, we propose FedDAF, a novel approach addressing both challenges in FDA. FedDAF uses similarity-based aggregation of the global source model and target model by calculating model functional distance from their mean gradient fields computed on target data. This enables effective model aggregation based on the target objective, constructed using target data, even with limited data. While computing model functional distance between these two models, FedDAF computes the angle between their mean gradient fields and then normalizes with the Gompertz function. To construct the global source model, all the local source models are aggregated using simple average in the server. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority over existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in terms of achieving better test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Transparent and Fair Profiling in Employment Services: Evidence from Switzerland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term unemployment (LTU) is a challenge for both jobseekers and public employment services. Statistical profiling tools are increasingly used to predict LTU risk. Some profiling tools are opaque, black-box machine learning models, which raise issues of transparency and fairness. This paper investigates whether interpretable models could serve as an alternative, using administrative data from Switzerland. Traditional statistical, interpretable, and black-box models are compared in terms of predictive performance, interpretability, and fairness. It is shown that explainable boosting machines, a recent interpretable model, perform nearly as well as the best black-box models. It is also shown how model sparsity, feature smoothing, and fairness mitigation can enhance transparency and fairness with only minor losses in performance. These findings suggest that interpretable profiling provides an accountable and trustworthy alternative to black-box models without compromising performance.</description>

      <title>TabStruct: Measuring Structural Fidelity of Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating tabular generators remains a challenging problem, as the unique causal structural prior of heterogeneous tabular data does not lend itself to intuitive human inspection. Recent work has introduced structural fidelity as a tabular-specific evaluation dimension to assess whether synthetic data complies with the causal structures of real data. However, existing benchmarks often neglect the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional evaluation dimensions, thus failing to provide a holistic understanding of model performance. Moreover, they are typically limited to toy datasets, as quantifying existing structural fidelity metrics requires access to ground-truth causal structures, which are rarely available for real-world datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that jointly considers structural fidelity and conventional evaluation dimensions. We introduce a new evaluation metric, $\textbf{global utility}$, which enables the assessment of structural fidelity even in the absence of ground-truth causal structures. In addition, we present $\textbf{TabStruct}$, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark offering large-scale quantitative analysis on 13 tabular generators from nine distinct categories, across 29 datasets. Our results demonstrate that global utility provides a task-independent, domain-agnostic lens for tabular generator performance. We release the TabStruct benchmark suite, including all datasets, evaluation pipelines, and raw results. Code is available at https://github.com/SilenceX12138/TabStruct.</description>

      <title>Deep operator network for surrogate modeling of poroelasticity with random permeability fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poroelasticity -- coupled fluid flow and elastic deformation in porous media -- often involves spatially variable permeability, especially in subsurface systems. In such cases, simulations with random permeability fields are widely used for probabilistic analysis, uncertainty quantification, and inverse problems. These simulations require repeated forward solves that are often prohibitively expensive, motivating the development of efficient surrogate models. However, efficient surrogate modeling techniques for poroelasticity with random permeability fields remain scarce. In this study, we propose a surrogate modeling framework based on the deep operator network (DeepONet), a neural architecture designed to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. The proposed surrogate model approximates the solution operator that maps random permeability fields to transient poroelastic responses. To enhance predictive accuracy and stability, we integrate three strategies: nondimensionalization of the governing equations, input dimensionality reduction via Karhunen--Lo\'eve expansion, and a two-step training procedure that decouples the optimization of branch and trunk networks. The methodology is evaluated on two benchmark problems in poroelasticity: soil consolidation and ground subsidence induced by groundwater extraction. In both cases, the DeepONet achieves substantial speedup in inference while maintaining high predictive accuracy across a wide range of permeability statistics. These results highlight the potential of the proposed approach as a scalable and efficient surrogate modeling technique for poroelastic systems with random permeability fields.</description>

      <title>MillStone: How Open-Minded Are LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models equipped with Web search, information retrieval tools, and other agentic capabilities are beginning to supplant traditional search engines. As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics, including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the documents they use as their information sources.
  In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether these arguments are the same for different LLMs.
  In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance, highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.</description>

      <title>Examining the Relationship between Scientific Publishing Activity and Hype-Driven Financial Bubbles: A Comparison of the Dot-Com and AI Eras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial bubbles often arrive without much warning, but create long-lasting economic effects. For example, during the dot-com bubble, innovative technologies created market disruptions through excitement for a promised bright future. Such technologies originated from research where scientists had developed them for years prior to their entry into the markets. That raises a question on the possibility of analyzing scientific publishing data (e.g. citation networks) leading up to a bubble for signals that may forecast the rise and fall of similar future bubbles. To that end, we utilized temporal SNAs to detect possible relationships between the publication citation networks of scientists and financial market data during two modern eras of rapidly shifting technology: 1) dot-com era from 1994 to 2001 and 2) AI era from 2017 to 2024. Results showed that the patterns from the dot-com era (which did end in a bubble) did not definitively predict the rise and fall of an AI bubble. While yearly citation networks reflected possible changes in publishing behavior of scientists between the two eras, there was a subset of AI era scientists whose publication influence patterns mirrored those during the dot-com era. Upon further analysis using multiple analysis techniques (LSTM, KNN, AR X/GARCH), the data seems to suggest two possibilities for the AI era: unprecedented form of financial bubble unseen or that no bubble exists. In conclusion, our findings imply that the patterns present in the dot-com era do not effectively translate in such a manner to apply them to the AI market.</description>

      <title>Low-rank Orthogonalization for Large-scale Matrix Optimization with Applications to Foundation Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network (NN) training is inherently a large-scale matrix optimization problem, yet the matrix structure of NN parameters has long been overlooked. Recently, the optimizer Muon \cite{jordanmuon}, which explicitly exploits this structure, has gained significant attention for its strong performance in foundation model training. A key component contributing to Muon's success is matrix orthogonalization. In this paper, we propose {\it low-rank orthogonalization}, which explicitly leverages the low-rank nature of gradients during NN training. Building on this, we propose low-rank matrix-signed gradient descent and a low-rank variant of Muon. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of low-rank orthogonalization, with the low-rank Muon achieving promising results in GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining -- surpassing the performance of the carefully tuned vanilla Muon. Theoretically, we establish the iteration complexity of the low-rank matrix-signed gradient descent for finding an approximate stationary solution, as well as that of low-rank Muon for finding an approximate stochastic stationary solution under heavy-tailed noise.</description>

      <title>Learning from Uncertain Similarity and Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing similarity-based weakly supervised learning approaches often rely on precise similarity annotations between data pairs, which may inadvertently expose sensitive label information and raise privacy risks. To mitigate this issue, we propose Uncertain Similarity and Unlabeled Learning (USimUL), a novel framework where each similarity pair is embedded with an uncertainty component to reduce label leakage. In this paper, we propose an unbiased risk estimator that learns from uncertain similarity and unlabeled data. Additionally, we theoretically prove that the estimator achieves statistically optimal parametric convergence rates. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior classification performance compared to conventional similarity-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Behavior via Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Closed-Form Reward Centroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of generalizing an expert agent's behavior, provided through demonstrations, to new environments and/or additional constraints. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) offers a promising solution by seeking to recover the expert's underlying reward function, which, if used for planning in the new settings, would reproduce the desired behavior. However, IRL is inherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible set, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce different policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional information, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy. In this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the "average" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset of the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by planning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a closed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for estimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations only. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the relationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our method.</description>

      <title>AMQ: Enabling AutoML for Mixed-precision Weight-Only Quantization of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is essential to identify the best-performing model under strict memory constraints. We present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over 10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1) search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4) iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact and high-performing. Our code is available at https://github.com/dlwns147/amq.</description>

      <title>Learning non-Markovian Dynamical Systems with Signature-based Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations offer an effective framework for modeling dynamical systems by learning a continuous-time vector field. However, they rely on the Markovian assumption - that future states depend only on the current state - which is often untrue in real-world scenarios where the dynamics may depend on the history of past states. This limitation becomes especially evident in settings involving the continuous control of complex systems with delays and memory effects. To capture historical dependencies, existing approaches often rely on recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders, which are inherently discrete and struggle with continuous modeling. In addition, they may exhibit poor training behavior. In this work, we investigate the use of the signature transform as an encoder for learning non-Markovian dynamics in a continuous-time setting. The signature transform offers a continuous-time alternative with strong theoretical foundations and proven efficiency in summarizing multidimensional information in time. We integrate a signature-based encoding scheme into encoder-decoder dynamics models and demonstrate that it outperforms RNN-based alternatives in test performance on synthetic benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning as Return Distribution Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of training a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) agent through imitation learning (IL). Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only to train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average performance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return distribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the risk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's return distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting and assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited expressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and sufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it. Building on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC and RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and known, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample complexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further demonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the setting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based variant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and RS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and the advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard sample-efficient IL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Travel Time and Weather-Aware Traffic Forecasting in a Conformal Graph Neural Network Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting is essential for managing congestion, improving safety, and optimizing various transportation systems. However, it remains a prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV) values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then, validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying the model's robustness.</description>

      <title>Hi-DARTS: Hierarchical Dynamically Adapting Reinforcement Trading System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional autonomous trading systems struggle to balance computational efficiency and market responsiveness due to their fixed operating frequency. We propose Hi-DARTS, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses this trade-off. Hi-DARTS utilizes a meta-agent to analyze market volatility and dynamically activate specialized Time Frame Agents for high-frequency or low-frequency trading as needed. During back-testing on AAPL stock from January 2024 to May 2025, Hi-DARTS yielded a cumulative return of 25.17% with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.75. This performance surpasses standard benchmarks, including a passive buy-and-hold strategy on AAPL (12.19% return) and the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) (20.01% return). Our work demonstrates that dynamic, hierarchical agents can achieve superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining high computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Foundational theory for optimal decision tree problems. II. Optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision trees are a ubiquitous model for classification and regression tasks due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, solving the optimal decision tree (ODT) problem remains a challenging combinatorial optimization task. Even for the simplest splitting rules--axis-parallel hyperplanes--it is NP-hard to optimize. In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper decision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four formal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four generic algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees satisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties of hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial hypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.
  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the algorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the first hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to hyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on general-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general hypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers.
  Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision trees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature noise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more accurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise. We also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets, showing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree complexity is properly controlled.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Branched Broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) Infestation in Tomato Crops Using Leaf Spectral Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic weed that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host. We investigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm) and ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California, we tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree days (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and preprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, correlation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near 1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf water content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at 585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Accuracy declined at later stages (e.g., 69% at 1568 GDD), likely due to senescence and weed interference. Despite the small number of infected plants and environmental confounders, results show that proximal sensing with ensemble learning enables timely detection of broomrape before canopy symptoms are visible, supporting targeted interventions and reduced yield losses.</description>

      <title>A Time-Series Foundation Model by Universal Delay Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images, which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics, establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial applicability.</description>

      <title>Deceptive Risk Minimization: Out-of-Distribution Generalization by Deceiving Distribution Shift Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes deception as a mechanism for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization: by learning data representations that make training data appear independent and identically distributed (iid) to an observer, we can identify stable features that eliminate spurious correlations and generalize to unseen domains. We refer to this principle as deceptive risk minimization (DRM) and instantiate it with a practical differentiable objective that simultaneously learns features that eliminate distribution shifts from the perspective of a detector based on conformal martingales while minimizing a task-specific loss. In contrast to domain adaptation or prior invariant representation learning methods, DRM does not require access to test data or a partitioning of training data into a finite number of data-generating domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of DRM on numerical experiments with concept shift and a simulated imitation learning setting with covariate shift in environments that a robot is deployed in.</description>

      <title>Draw a Portrait of Your Graph Data: An Instance-Level Profiling Framework for Graph-Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph machine learning models often achieve similar overall performance yet behave differently at the node level, failing on different subsets of nodes with varying reliability. Standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy obscure these fine grained differences, making it difficult to diagnose when and where models fail. We introduce NodePro, a node profiling framework that enables fine-grained diagnosis of model behavior by assigning interpretable profile scores to individual nodes. These scores combine data-centric signals, such as feature dissimilarity, label uncertainty, and structural ambiguity, with model-centric measures of prediction confidence and consistency during training. By aligning model behavior with these profiles, NodePro reveals systematic differences between models, even when aggregate metrics are indistinguishable. We show that node profiles generalize to unseen nodes, supporting prediction reliability without ground-truth labels. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of NodePro in identifying semantically inconsistent or corrupted nodes in a structured knowledge graph, illustrating its effectiveness in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>$K$-Level Policy Gradients for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) typically employ a policy update that responds to the current strategies of other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient (KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL algorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior performance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent MuJoCo.</description>

      <title>Do machine learning climate models work in changing climate dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of unprecedented events, deviating from established patterns. Predicting these out-of-distribution (OOD) events is critical for assessing risks and guiding climate adaptation. While machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in providing precise, high-speed climate predictions, their ability to generalize under distribution shifts remains a significant limitation that has been underexplored in climate contexts. This research systematically evaluates state-of-the-art ML-based climate models in diverse OOD scenarios by adapting established OOD evaluation methodologies to climate data. Experiments on large-scale datasets reveal notable performance variability across scenarios, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of current models. These findings underscore the importance of robust evaluation frameworks and provide actionable insights to guide the reliable application of ML for climate risk forecasting.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Networks by Neuron Pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first part of this paper studies the evolution of gradient flow for homogeneous neural networks near a class of saddle points exhibiting a sparsity structure. The choice of these saddle points is motivated from previous works on homogeneous networks, which identified the first saddle point encountered by gradient flow after escaping the origin. It is shown here that, when initialized sufficiently close to such saddle points, gradient flow remains near the saddle point for a sufficiently long time, during which the set of weights with small norm remain small but converge in direction. Furthermore, important empirical observations are made on the behavior of gradient descent after escaping these saddle points. The second part of the paper, motivated by these results, introduces a greedy algorithm to train deep neural networks called Neuron Pursuit (NP). It is an iterative procedure which alternates between expanding the network by adding neuron(s) with carefully chosen weights, and minimizing the training loss using this augmented network. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated using numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>From Autoencoders to CycleGAN: Robust Unpaired Face Manipulation via Adversarial Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human face synthesis and manipulation are increasingly important in entertainment and AI, with a growing demand for highly realistic, identity-preserving images even when only unpaired, unaligned datasets are available. We study unpaired face manipulation via adversarial learning, moving from autoencoder baselines to a robust, guided CycleGAN framework. While autoencoders capture coarse identity, they often miss fine details. Our approach integrates spectral normalization for stable training, identity- and perceptual-guided losses to preserve subject identity and high-level structure, and landmark-weighted cycle constraints to maintain facial geometry across pose and illumination changes. Experiments show that our adversarial trained CycleGAN improves realism (FID), perceptual quality (LPIPS), and identity preservation (ID-Sim) over autoencoders, with competitive cycle-reconstruction SSIM and practical inference times, which achieved high quality without paired datasets and approaching pix2pix on curated paired subsets. These results demonstrate that guided, spectrally normalized CycleGANs provide a practical path from autoencoders to robust unpaired face manipulation.</description>

      <title>All that structure matches does not glitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models for materials, especially inorganic crystals, hold potential to transform the theoretical prediction of novel compounds and structures. Advancement in this field depends critically on robust benchmarks and minimal, information-rich datasets that enable meaningful model evaluation. This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a crystal structure prediction task$\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains $\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we find to be the case for the perov-5 dataset. Third, benchmarks can mislead if used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and split by number of atoms $N$, and two containing only identical structures but with different unit cells. We also propose a new split for the perov-5 dataset which ensures polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with the match rate metric.</description>

      <title>Event2Vec: A Geometric Approach to Learning Composable Representations of Event Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our hypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the improved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Relational Priming Improves Transformer in Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token representations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each layer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\% improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior relational modeling capabilities.</description>

      <title>Learning Stackable and Skippable LEGO Bricks for Efficient, Reconfigurable, and Variable-Resolution Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06389v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating photo-realistic images but come with significant computational costs in both training and sampling. While various techniques address these computational challenges, a less-explored issue is designing an efficient and adaptable network backbone for iterative refinement. Current options like U-Net and Vision Transformer often rely on resource-intensive deep networks and lack the flexibility needed for generating images at variable resolutions or with a smaller network than used in training. This study introduces LEGO bricks, which seamlessly integrate Local-feature Enrichment and Global-content Orchestration. These bricks can be stacked to create a test-time reconfigurable diffusion backbone, allowing selective skipping of bricks to reduce sampling costs and generate higher-resolution images than the training data. LEGO bricks enrich local regions with an MLP and transform them using a Transformer block while maintaining a consistent full-resolution image across all bricks. Experimental results demonstrate that LEGO bricks enhance training efficiency, expedite convergence, and facilitate variable-resolution image generation while maintaining strong generative performance. Moreover, LEGO significantly reduces sampling time compared to other methods, establishing it as a valuable enhancement for diffusion models. Our code and project page are available at https://jegzheng.github.io/LEGODiffusion.</description>

      <title>Information Entropy-Based Scheduling for Communication-Efficient Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) over resource-constrained networks by introducing node-based and link-based scheduling strategies to enhance communication efficiency. In each iteration of the D-SGD algorithm, only a few disjoint subsets of nodes or links are randomly activated, subject to a given communication cost constraint. We propose a novel importance metric based on information entropy to determine node and link scheduling probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations, comparing it against state-of-the-art methods, including betweenness centrality (BC) for node scheduling and \textit{MATCHA} for link scheduling. The results show that our method consistently outperforms the BC-based method in the node scheduling case, achieving faster convergence with up to 60\% lower communication budgets. At higher communication budgets (above 60\%), our method maintains comparable or superior performance. In the link scheduling case, our method delivers results that are superior to or on par with those of \textit{MATCHA}.</description>

      <title>YOLO-based Bearing Fault Diagnosis With Continuous Wavelet Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03070v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a YOLO-based framework for spatial bearing fault diagnosis using time-frequency spectrograms derived from continuous wavelet transform (CWT). One-dimensional vibration signals are first transformed into time-frequency spectrograms using Morlet wavelets to capture transient fault signatures. These spectrograms are then processed by YOLOv9, v10, and v11 models to classify fault types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets, including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU), and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), the proposed CWT-YOLO pipeline achieves significantly higher accuracy and generalizability than the baseline MCNN-LSTM model. Notably, YOLOv11 reaches mAP scores of 99.4% (CWRU), 97.8% (PU), and 99.5% (IMS). In addition, its region-aware detection mechanism enables direct visualization of fault locations in spectrograms, offering a practical solution for condition monitoring in rotating machinery.</description>

      <title>Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an agentic artificial intelligence (AI)-driven double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduling framework for licensed and unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. SL must share licensed spectrum with cellular communications (CC) and unlicensed bands with Wi-Fi, posing significant challenges for coexistence. Unlike prior rule-based or threshold-based methods, the proposed agentic scheduler autonomously perceives queueing dynamics, channel conditions, and coexistence states, and adapts its policy to maintain quality-of-service (QoS). Simulation results show that our framework reduces the blocking rate by up to 87.5% compared to threshold-based scheduling under limited licensed bandwidth. These findings demonstrate the potential of Agentic AI to enable stable, QoS-aware, and adaptive scheduling for future NR SL systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Bottleneck in Deep Neural Networks: Noise is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to exhibit a spectral learning bias, wherein low-frequency components are learned early in training, while high-frequency modes emerge more gradually in later epochs. However, when the target signal lacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies, training suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to reconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie within the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in the context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting high-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To effectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we propose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER - weight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network initialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian noise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide control over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the empirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral bottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and achieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks. Beyond signal reconstruction, our approach opens new directions for adaptive weight initialization strategies in computer vision and scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Momentum-integrated Multi-task Stock Recommendation with Converge-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stock recommendation is critical in Fintech applications, which use price series and alternative information to estimate future stock performance. Although deep learning models are prevalent in stock recommendation systems, traditional time-series forecasting training often fails to capture stock trends and rankings simultaneously, which are essential consideration factors for investors. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework for stock recommendation, \textbf{M}omentum-\textbf{i}ntegrated \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{Stoc}k \textbf{R}ecommendation with Converge-based Optimization (\textbf{MiM-StocR}). To improve the model's ability to capture short-term trends, we novelly invoke a momentum line indicator in model training. To prioritize top-performing stocks and optimize investment allocation, we propose a list-wise ranking loss function called Adaptive-k ApproxNDCG. Moreover, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock market, existing MTL frameworks face overfitting issues when applied to stock time series. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Converge-based Quad-Balancing (CQB) method. We conducted extensive experiments on three stock benchmarks: SEE50, CSI 100, and CSI 300. MiM-StocR outperforms state-of-the-art MTL baselines across both ranking and profitable evaluations.</description>

      <title>The LLM as a Network Operator: A Vision for Generative AI in the 6G Radio Access Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The management of future AI-native Next-Generation (NextG) Radio Access Networks (RANs), including 6G and beyond, presents a challenge of immense complexity that exceeds the capabilities of traditional automation. In response, we introduce the concept of the LLM-RAN Operator. In this paradigm, a Large Language Model (LLM) is embedded into the RAN control loop to translate high-level human intents into optimal network actions. Unlike prior empirical studies, we present a formal framework for an LLM-RAN operator that builds on earlier work by making guarantees checkable through an adapter aligned with the Open RAN (O-RAN) standard, separating strategic LLM-driven guidance in the Non-Real-Time (RT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) from reactive execution in the Near-RT RIC, including a proposition on policy expressiveness and a theorem on convergence to stable fixed points. By framing the problem with mathematical rigor, our work provides the analytical tools to reason about the feasibility and stability of AI-native RAN control. It identifies critical research challenges in safety, real-time performance, and physical-world grounding. This paper aims to bridge the gap between AI theory and wireless systems engineering in the NextG era, aligning with the AI4NextG vision to develop knowledgeable, intent-driven wireless networks that integrate generative AI into the heart of the RAN.</description>

      <title>SABR: A Stable Adaptive Bitrate Framework Using Behavior Cloning Pretraining and Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of 5G, the internet has entered a new video-centric era. From short-video platforms like TikTok to long-video platforms like Bilibili, online video services are reshaping user consumption habits. Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) control is widely recognized as a critical factor influencing Quality of Experience (QoE). Recent learning-based ABR methods have attracted increasing attention. However, most of them rely on limited network trace sets during training and overlook the wide-distribution characteristics of real-world network conditions, resulting in poor generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose SABR, a training framework that combines behavior cloning (BC) pretraining with reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. We also introduce benchmarks, ABRBench-3G and ABRBench-4G+, which provide wide-coverage training traces and dedicated OOD test sets for assessing robustness to unseen network conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SABR achieves the best average rank compared with Pensieve, Comyco, and NetLLM across the proposed benchmarks. These results indicate that SABR enables more stable learning across wide distributions and improves generalization to unseen network conditions.</description>

      <title>FlowECG: Using Flow Matching to Create a More Efficient ECG Signal Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic electrocardiogram generation serves medical AI applications requiring privacy-preserving data sharing and training dataset augmentation. Current diffusion-based methods achieve high generation quality but require hundreds of neural network evaluations during sampling, creating computational bottlenecks for clinical deployment. We propose FlowECG, a flow matching approach that adapts the SSSD-ECG architecture by replacing the iterative diffusion process with continuous flow dynamics. Flow matching learns direct transport paths from noise to data distributions through ordinary differential equation solving. We evaluate our method on the PTB-XL dataset using Dynamic Time Warping, Wasserstein distance, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and spectral similarity metrics. FlowECG matches SSSD-ECG performance at 200 neural function evaluations, outperforming the baseline on three metrics. The key finding shows that FlowECG maintains generation quality with substantially fewer sampling steps, achieving comparable results with 10-25 evaluations compared to 200 for diffusion methods. This efficiency improvement reduces computational requirements by an order of magnitude while preserving physiologically realistic 12-lead ECG characteristics. The approach enables practical deployment in resource-limited clinical settings where real-time generation or large-scale synthetic data creation is needed.</description>

      <title>DeepSeasons: a Deep Learning scale-selecting approach to Seasonal Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seasonal forecasting remains challenging due to the inherent chaotic nature of atmospheric dynamics. This paper introduces DeepSeasons, a novel deep learning approach designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of seasonal forecasts. Leveraging advanced neural network architectures and extensive historical climatic datasets, DeepSeasons identifies complex, nonlinear patterns and dependencies in climate variables with similar or improved skill respcet GCM-based forecasting methods, at a significant lower cost. The framework also allow tailored application to specific regions or variables, rather than the overall problem of predicting the entire atmosphere/ocean system. The proposed methods also allow for direct predictions of anomalies and time-means, opening a new approach to long-term forecasting and highlighting its potential for operational deployment in climate-sensitive sectors. This innovative methodology promises substantial improvements in managing climate-related risks and decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>FireGNN: Neuro-Symbolic Graph Neural Networks with Trainable Fuzzy Rules for Interpretable Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image classification requires not only high predictive performance but also interpretability to ensure clinical trust and adoption. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Psychiatric Disorder Detection via Self-supervised Learning on Frequency-enhanced Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Psychiatric disorders involve complex neural activity changes, with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data serving as key diagnostic evidence. However, data scarcity and the diverse nature of fMRI information pose significant challenges. While graph-based self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have shown promise in brain network analysis, they primarily focus on time-domain representations, often overlooking the rich information embedded in the frequency domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose Frequency-Enhanced Network (FENet), a novel SSL framework specially designed for fMRI data that integrates time-domain and frequency-domain information to improve psychiatric disorder detection in small-sample datasets. FENet constructs multi-view brain networks based on the inherent properties of fMRI data, explicitly incorporating frequency information into the learning process of representation. Additionally, it employs domain-specific encoders to capture temporal-spectral characteristics, including an efficient frequency-domain encoder that highlights disease-relevant frequency features. Finally, FENet introduces a domain consistency-guided learning objective, which balances the utilization of diverse information and generates frequency-enhanced brain graph representations. Experiments on two real-world medical datasets demonstrate that FENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strong performance in minimal data conditions. Furthermore, we analyze the correlation between various frequency-domain features and psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the critical role of high-frequency information in disorder detection.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Ensemble Framework for Multi-Omics Dementia Biomarker Discovery Under HDLSS Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomarker discovery in neurodegenerative diseases requires robust, interpretable frameworks capable of integrating high-dimensional multi-omics data under low-sample conditions. We propose a novel ensemble approach combining Graph Attention Networks (GAT), MultiOmics Variational AutoEncoder (MOVE), Elastic-net sparse regression, and Storey's False Discovery Rate (FDR). This framework is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods including DIABLO, MOCAT, AMOGEL, and MOMLIN. We evaluate performance using both simulated multi-omics data and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our method demonstrates superior predictive accuracy, feature selection precision, and biological relevance. Biomarker gene maps derived from both datasets are visualized and interpreted, offering insights into latent molecular mechanisms underlying dementia.</description>

      <title>Crystal Systems Classification of Phosphate-Based Cathode Materials Using Machine Learning for Lithium-Ion Battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical and chemical characteristics of cathodes used in batteries are derived from the lithium-ion phosphate cathodes crystalline arrangement, which is pivotal to the overall battery performance. Therefore, the correct prediction of the crystal system is essential to estimate the properties of cathodes. This study applies machine learning classification algorithms for predicting the crystal systems, namely monoclinic, orthorhombic, and triclinic, related to Li P (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, V) O based Phosphate cathodes. The data used in this work is extracted from the Materials Project. Feature evaluation showed that cathode properties depend on the crystal structure, and optimized classification strategies lead to better predictability. Ensemble machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Gradient Boosting Machines have demonstrated the best predictive capabilities for crystal systems in the Monte Carlo cross-validation test. Additionally, sequential forward selection (SFS) is performed to identify the most critical features influencing the prediction accuracy for different machine learning models, with Volume, Band gap, and Sites as input features ensemble machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (80.69%), Extremely Randomized Tree (78.96%), and Gradient Boosting Machine (80.40%) approaches lead to the maximum accuracy towards crystallographic classification with stability and the predicted materials can be the potential cathode materials for lithium ion batteries.</description>

Abstract: Air pollution in cities and the possibilities of reducing this pollution represents one of the most important factors that today's society has to deal with. This paper focuses on a systemic approach to traffic emissions with their relation to meteorological conditions, analyzing the effect of weather on the quantity and dispersion of traffic emissions in a city. Using fuzzy inference systems (FIS) the model for prediction of changes in emissions depending on various conditions is developed. The proposed model is based on traffic, meteorology and emission data measured in Prague, Czech Republic. The main objective of the work is to provide insight into how urban planners and policymakers can plan and manage urban transport more effectively with environmental protection in mind.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Temporal Fusion Transformers for Cryptocurrency Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise short-term price prediction in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market is critical for informed trading strategies. Although Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) have shown potential, their direct use often struggles in the face of the market's non-stationary nature and extreme volatility. This paper introduces an adaptive TFT modeling approach leveraging dynamic subseries lengths and pattern-based categorization to enhance short-term forecasting. We propose a novel segmentation method where subseries end at relative maxima, identified when the price increase from the preceding minimum surpasses a threshold, thus capturing significant upward movements, which act as key markers for the end of a growth phase, while potentially filtering the noise. Crucially, the fixed-length pattern ending each subseries determines the category assigned to the subsequent variable-length subseries, grouping typical market responses that follow similar preceding conditions. A distinct TFT model trained for each category is specialized in predicting the evolution of these subsequent subseries based on their initial steps after the preceding peak. Experimental results on ETH-USDT 10-minute data over a two-month test period demonstrate that our adaptive approach significantly outperforms baseline fixed-length TFT and LSTM models in prediction accuracy and simulated trading profitability. Our combination of adaptive segmentation and pattern-conditioned forecasting enables more robust and responsive cryptocurrency price prediction.</description>

      <title>Robust DDoS-Attack Classification with 3D CNNs Against Adversarial Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks remain a serious threat to online infrastructure, often bypassing detection by altering traffic in subtle ways. We present a method using hive-plot sequences of network data and a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to classify DDoS traffic with high accuracy. Our system relies on three main ideas: (1) using spatio-temporal hive-plot encodings to set a pattern-recognition baseline, (2) applying adversarial training with FGSM and PGD alongside spatial noise and image shifts, and (3) analyzing frame-wise predictions to find early signals. On a benchmark dataset, our method lifts adversarial accuracy from 50-55% to over 93% while maintaining clean-sample performance. Frames 3-4 offer strong predictive signals, showing early-stage classification is possible.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Vulnerability of Large Language Models in the Financial Domain via Risk Concealment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial applications, yet existing red-teaming research primarily targets harmful content, largely neglecting regulatory risks. In this work, we aim to investigate the vulnerability of financial LLMs through red-teaming approaches. We introduce Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA), a novel multi-turn framework that iteratively conceals regulatory risks to provoke seemingly compliant yet regulatory-violating responses from LLMs. To enable systematic evaluation, we construct FIN-Bench, a domain-specific benchmark for assessing LLM safety in financial contexts. Extensive experiments on FIN-Bench demonstrate that RCA effectively bypasses nine mainstream LLMs, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 93.18%, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1. These findings reveal a critical gap in current alignment techniques and underscore the urgent need for stronger moderation mechanisms in financial domains. We hope this work offers practical insights for advancing robust and domain-aware LLM alignment.</description>

Abstract: Despite the diversity of brain data acquired and advanced AI-based algorithms to analyze them, brain features are rarely used in clinics for diagnosis and prognosis. Here we argue that the field continues to rely on cohort comparisons to seek biomarkers, despite the well-established degeneracy of brain features. Using a thought experiment, we show that more data and more powerful algorithms will not be sufficient to identify biomarkers of brain diseases. We argue that instead of comparing patient versus healthy controls using single data type, we should use multimodal (e.g. brain activity, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, brain imaging) and longitudinal brain data to guide the grouping before defining multidimensional biomarkers for brain diseases.</description>

      <title>Auditable Early Stopping for Agentic Routing: Ledger-Verified Run-Wise Certificates under Local DP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In production tool-use agents (e.g., retrieval $\to$ summarization $\to$ calculator), routers must know when to stop exploring while preserving local DP and leaving an auditable trail. We present run-wise early-stopping certificates for perturb-and-MAP (PaM) best-first search on context-indexed prefix DAGs whose children partition the leaves. We couple realized path scores and pruning keys to a single exponential race realized lazily via offset propagation. With exact leaf counts $N(v)$, lazy reuse at winners and independent residuals yield an Exact mode with a sound halting rule based on Key$(v) = M_tau(v) - \log t(v)$, where $t(v)$ is the minimum arrival time among leaves under $v$. With only upper bounds $N_{ub} \ge N$, a Surrogate mode uses a parent-anchored surrogate race without winner reuse; because $-\log \hat t \ge -\log t$, the frontier invariant holds and stopping remains sound. We add a compiler from shared-node DAGs to prefix DAGs, local finiteness checks, a SuffixCountDP routine for exact counts with safe downgrades, a validator-side tightening term $\kappa = \log(N/N_{ub})$, and an auditable ledger/validator that replays runs deterministically. We also give an absolute LogSumExp tail bound, an acyclicity certificate, and a fallback PRF-per-leaf scheme (NoCert) whose work matches a realized-score best-first baseline up to a small per-node overhead. Finally, we integrate a price/latency/$(\epsilon, \delta)$-aware multi-LLM controller and DP-trained LoRA adapters chosen at runtime; these choices do not affect the two-mode frontier invariants. We report Mac/commodity-hardware reproducible results, a small real tool-use pipeline, and validator-checked audit trails, with code and ledgers provided.</description>

      <title>Trial-Level Time-frequency EEG Desynchronization as a Neural Marker of Pain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pain remains one of the most pressing health challenges, yet its measurement still relies heavily on self-report, limiting monitoring in non-communicative patients and hindering translational research. Neural oscillations recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) provide a promising avenue for identifying reproducible markers of nociceptive processing. Prior studies have reported pain-related event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha and beta bands, but most rely on trial-averaging, obscuring variability that may be critical for perception. We analyzed high-density EEG from 59 healthy participants who underwent electrical stimulation under Pain and No-Pain conditions. Per-trial time-frequency decomposition revealed robust beta-band ERD in frontal-central electrodes that differentiated Pain from No-Pain trials. Generalized linear mixed models demonstrated that ERD scaled with subjective intensity ratings (VAS), and that age and gender moderated this relationship. Reverse models further showed that ERD predicted VAS ratings across participants, underscoring its potential as a nonverbal marker of pain. These findings provide preliminary evidence that trial-level EEG oscillations can serve as reliable indicators of pain and open avenues for individualized, report-free pain monitoring. Future work should validate these results in patient populations and extend analyses to multimodal approaches combining EEG, MRI, and attention-based modulation strategies.</description>

Abstract: Video-based assessment of motor symptoms in conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD) offers a scalable alternative to in-clinic evaluations, but home-recorded videos introduce significant challenges, including visual degradation, inconsistent task execution, annotation noise, and domain shifts. We present HiLWS, a cascaded human-in-the-loop weak supervision framework for curating and annotating hand motor task videos from both clinical and home settings. Unlike conventional single-stage weak supervision methods, HiLWS employs a novel cascaded approach, first applies weak supervision to aggregate expert-provided annotations into probabilistic labels, which are then used to train machine learning models. Model predictions, combined with expert input, are subsequently refined through a second stage of weak supervision. The complete pipeline includes quality filtering, optimized pose estimation, and task-specific segment extraction, complemented by context-sensitive evaluation metrics that assess both visual fidelity and clinical relevance by prioritizing ambiguous cases for expert review. Our findings reveal key failure modes in home recorded data and emphasize the importance of context-sensitive curation strategies for robust medical video analysis.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Limits of Graph Neural Networks for Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium Prediction: A Cryogenic Mixture Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and fast thermophysical models are needed to embed vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations in design, optimization, and control loops for cryogenic mixtures. This study asks whether a structure-aware graph neural network (GNN; DimeNet++) trained on GERG-2008/CoolProp data can act as a practical surrogate for an equation of state (EoS). We generate a ternary dataset over 90-200 K and pressures to 100 bar, curate it with a 15% density filter (reducing 5,200 states to 1,516), and pair each state with a lightweight molecular-dynamics snapshot to supply structural features. The model is trained in two stages; pretraining on residual Helmholtz energy followed by pressure fine-tuning with a stability penalty; and evaluated via single-phase interpolation tests, solver-free derivative-quality diagnostics, an audited VLE driver, and a latency benchmark. Within its regime, the GNN interpolates single-phase properties reasonably well; however, the VLE driver accepts no GNN equilibria on tested binaries (all plotted VLE points are CoolProp fallback or the solver fails), and diagnostic probes reveal jagged P(V|T) paths and thermal-stability flags concentrated in dense/cold regions, indicating insufficient derivative smoothness/consistency for robust equilibrium solving. An end-to-end timing comparison shows no single-phase speed advantage relative to CoolProp (tens of milliseconds vs sub-millisecond). We conclude that, as configured, the surrogate in this study is not solver-ready for VLE and offers no runtime benefit; its value is methodological, delineating failure modes and pointing to remedies such as physics-informed training signals and targeted coverage near phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>National Running Club Database: Assessing Collegiate Club Athletes' Cross Country Race Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The National Running Club Database (NRCD) aggregates 15,397 race results of 5,585 athletes from the 2023 and 2024 cross country seasons. This paper introduces the NRCD dataset, which provides insights into individual athlete progressions, enabling data-driven decision-making. Analysis reveals that runners' improvement per calendar day for women, racing 6,000m, and men, racing 8,000m, is more pronounced in athletes with slower initial race times and those who race more frequently. Additionally, we factor in course conditions, including weather and elevation gain, to standardize improvement. While the NRCD shows a gender imbalance, 3,484 men vs. 2,101 women, the racing frequency between genders is comparable. This publication makes the NRCD dataset accessible to the research community, addressing a previous challenge where smaller datasets, often limited to 500 entries, had to be manually scraped from the internet. Focusing on club athletes rather than elite professionals offers a unique lens into the performance of real-world runners who balance competition with academics and other commitments. These results serve as a valuable resource for runners, coaches, and teams, bridging the gap between raw data and applied sports science.</description>

      <title>Building a General SimCLR Self-Supervised Foundation Model Across Neurological Diseases to Advance 3D Brain MRI Diagnoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans are commonly acquired in clinical settings to monitor a wide range of neurological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. While deep learning models have shown promising results analyzing 3D MRI across a number of brain imaging tasks, most are highly tailored for specific tasks with limited labeled data, and are not able to generalize across tasks and/or populations. The development of self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the creation of large medical foundation models that leverage diverse, unlabeled datasets ranging from healthy to diseased data, showing significant success in 2D medical imaging applications. However, even the very few foundation models for 3D brain MRI that have been developed remain limited in resolution, scope, or accessibility. In this work, we present a general, high-resolution SimCLR-based SSL foundation model for 3D brain structural MRI, pre-trained on 18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 publicly available datasets spanning diverse neurological diseases. We compare our model to Masked Autoencoders (MAE), as well as two supervised baselines, on four diverse downstream prediction tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Our fine-tuned SimCLR model outperforms all other models across all tasks. Notably, our model still achieves superior performance when fine-tuned using only 20% of labeled training samples for predicting Alzheimer's disease. We use publicly available code and data, and release our trained model at https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/3D-Neuro-SimCLR, contributing a broadly applicable and accessible foundation model for clinical brain MRI analysis.</description>

      <title>On a Geometry of Interbrain Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective analysis in neuroscience benefits significantly from robust conceptual frameworks. Traditional metrics of interbrain synchrony in social neuroscience typically depend on fixed, correlation-based approaches, restricting their explanatory capacity to descriptive observations. Inspired by the successful integration of geometric insights in network science, we propose leveraging discrete geometry to examine the dynamic reconfigurations in neural interactions during social exchanges. Unlike conventional synchrony approaches, our method interprets inter-brain connectivity changes through the evolving geometric structures of neural networks. This geometric framework is realized through a pipeline that identifies critical transitions in network connectivity using entropy metrics derived from curvature distributions. By doing so, we significantly enhance the capacity of hyperscanning methodologies to uncover underlying neural mechanisms in interactive social behavior.</description>

      <title>LLM in the Middle: A Systematic Review of Threats and Mitigations to Real-World LLM-based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success and wide adoption of generative AI (GenAI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has attracted the attention of cybercriminals seeking to abuse models, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services. Moreover, providing security to LLM-based systems is a great challenge, as both traditional threats to software applications and threats targeting LLMs and their integration must be mitigated. In this survey, we shed light on security and privacy concerns of such LLM-based systems by performing a systematic review and comprehensive categorization of threats and defensive strategies considering the entire software and LLM life cycles. We analyze real-world scenarios with distinct characteristics of LLM usage, spanning from development to operation. In addition, threats are classified according to their severity level and to which scenarios they pertain, facilitating the identification of the most relevant threats. Recommended defense strategies are systematically categorized and mapped to the corresponding life cycle phase and possible attack strategies they attenuate. This work paves the way for consumers and vendors to understand and efficiently mitigate risks during integration of LLMs in their respective solutions or organizations. It also enables the research community to benefit from the discussion of open challenges and edge cases that may hinder the secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.</description>

      <title>Pluralistic Alignment for Healthcare: A Role-Driven Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare, ensuring their outputs reflect the diverse values and perspectives held across populations is critical. However, existing alignment approaches, including pluralistic paradigms like Modular Pluralism, often fall short in the health domain, where personal, cultural, and situational factors shape pluralism. Motivated by the aforementioned healthcare challenges, we propose a first lightweight, generalizable, pluralistic alignment approach, EthosAgents, designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values. We empirically show that it advances the pluralistic alignment for all three modes across seven varying-sized open and closed models. Our findings reveal that health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches, offering insights into how these models can better respect diversity in other high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>Struct-Bench: A Benchmark for Differentially Private Structured Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is a promising technique for utilizing private datasets that otherwise cannot be exposed for model training or other analytics. While much research literature has focused on generating private unstructured text and image data, in enterprise settings, structured data (e.g., tabular) is more common, often including natural language fields or components. Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques (e.g., FID) struggle to capture the structural properties and correlations of such datasets. In this work, we propose Struct-Bench, a framework and benchmark for evaluating synthetic datasets derived from structured datasets that contain natural language data. The Struct-Bench framework requires users to provide a representation of their dataset structure as a Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Our benchmark comprises 5 real-world and 2 synthetically generated datasets, each annotated with CFGs. We show that these datasets demonstrably present a great challenge even for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods. Struct-Bench also includes reference implementations of different metrics and a leaderboard, thereby providing researchers a standardized evaluation platform to benchmark and investigate privacy-preserving synthetic data generation methods. Further, we also present a case study showing how to use Struct-Bench to improve the synthetic data quality of Private Evolution (PE) on structured data. The benchmark and the leaderboard have been publicly made available at https://struct-bench.github.io.</description>

      <title>DOSA: Differentiable Model-Based One-Loop Search for DNN Accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the hardware design space exploration process, it is critical to optimize both hardware parameters and algorithm-to-hardware mappings. Previous work has largely approached this simultaneous optimization problem by separately exploring the hardware design space and the mapspace - both individually large and highly nonconvex spaces - independently. The resulting combinatorial explosion has created significant difficulties for optimizers.
  In this paper, we introduce DOSA, which consists of differentiable performance models and a gradient descent-based optimization technique to simultaneously explore both spaces and identify high-performing design points. Experimental results demonstrate that DOSA outperforms random search and Bayesian optimization by 2.80x and 12.59x, respectively, in improving DNN model energy-delay product, given a similar number of samples. We also demonstrate the modularity and flexibility of DOSA by augmenting our analytical model with a learned model, allowing us to optimize buffer sizes and mappings of a real DNN accelerator and attain a 1.82x improvement in energy-delay product.</description>

      <title>MinatoLoader: Accelerating Machine Learning Training Through Efficient Data Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data loaders are used by Machine Learning (ML) frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow to apply transformations to data before feeding it into the accelerator. This operation is called data preprocessing. Data preprocessing plays an important role in the ML training workflow because if it is inefficiently pipelined with the training, it can yield high GPU idleness, resulting in important training delays. Unfortunately, existing data loaders turn out to waste GPU resources, with $76\%$ GPU idleness when using the PyTorch data loader, for example. One key source of inefficiency is the variability in preprocessing time across samples within the same dataset. Existing data loaders are oblivious to this variability, and they construct batches without any consideration of slow or fast samples. In this case, the entire batch is delayed by a single slow sample, stalling the training pipeline and resulting in head-of-line blocking.
  To address these inefficiencies, we present MinatoLoader, a general-purpose data loader for PyTorch that accelerates training and improves GPU utilization. MinatoLoader is designed for a single-server setup, containing multiple GPUs. It continuously prepares data in the background and actively constructs batches by prioritizing fast-to-preprocess samples, while slower samples are processed in parallel.
  We evaluate MinatoLoader on servers with V100 and A100 GPUs. On a machine with four A100 GPUs, MinatoLoader improves the training time of a wide range of workloads by up to $7.5\times$ ($3.6\times$ on average) over PyTorch DataLoader and Pecan, and up to $3\times$ ($2.2\times$ on average) over DALI. It also increases average GPU utilization from 46.4\% with PyTorch to 90.45\%, while preserving model accuracy and enabling faster convergence.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Reinforcement Learning Prefetching Architecture for Multicore Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware prefetching is critical to fill the performance gap between CPU speeds and slower memory accesses. With multicore architectures becoming commonplace, traditional prefetchers are severely challenged. Independent core operation creates significant redundancy (up to 20% of prefetch requests are duplicates), causing unnecessary memory bus traffic and wasted bandwidth. Furthermore, cutting-edge prefetchers such as Pythia suffer from about a 10% performance loss when scaling from a single-core to a four-core system. To solve these problems, we propose CRL-Pythia, a coordinated reinforcement learning based prefetcher specifically designed for multicore systems. In this work, CRL-Pythia addresses these issues by enabling cross-core sharing of information and cooperative prefetching decisions, which greatly reduces redundant prefetch requests and improves learning convergence across cores. Our experiments demonstrate that CRL-Pythia outperforms single Pythia configurations in all cases, with approximately 12% IPC (instructions per cycle) improvement for bandwidth-constrained workloads, while imposing moderate hardware overhead. Our sensitivity analyses also verify its robustness and scalability, thereby making CRL-Pythia a practical and efficient solution to contemporary multicore systems.</description>

      <title>PolyTruth: Multilingual Disinformation Detection using Transformer-Based Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disinformation spreads rapidly across linguistic boundaries, yet most AI models are still benchmarked only on English. We address this gap with a systematic comparison of five multilingual transformer models: mBERT, XLM, XLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on a common fake-vs-true machine learning classification task. While transformer-based language models have demonstrated notable success in detecting disinformation in English, their effectiveness in multilingual contexts still remains up for debate. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus, a novel corpus of 60,486 statement pairs (false claim vs. factual correction) spanning over twenty five languages that collectively cover five language families and a broad topical range from politics, health, climate, finance, and conspiracy, half of which are fact-checked disinformation claims verified by an augmented MindBugs Discovery dataset. Our experiments revealed performance variations. Models such as RemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, particularly excelling in low-resource languages, whereas models like mBERT and XLM exhibit considerable limitations when training data is scarce. We provide a discussion of these performance patterns and implications for real-world deployment. The dataset is publicly available on our GitHub repository to encourage further experimentation and advancement. Our findings illuminate both the potential and the current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation detection.</description>

Abstract: We show that ensembles of deep neural networks, called deep ensembles, can be used to perform quantum parameter estimation while also providing a means for quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates, which is a key advantage of using Bayesian inference for parameter estimation. These models are shown to be more robust to noise in the measurement results used to perform the parameter estimation as well as noise in the data used to train them. We also show that much less data is needed to achieve comparable performance to Bayesian inference based estimation, which is known to reach the ultimate precision limit as more data is collected, than was used in previous proposals.</description>

Abstract: RSL-RL is an open-source Reinforcement Learning library tailored to the specific needs of the robotics community. Unlike broad general-purpose frameworks, its design philosophy prioritizes a compact and easily modifiable codebase, allowing researchers to adapt and extend algorithms with minimal overhead. The library focuses on algorithms most widely adopted in robotics, together with auxiliary techniques that address robotics-specific challenges. Optimized for GPU-only training, RSL-RL achieves high-throughput performance in large-scale simulation environments. Its effectiveness has been validated in both simulation benchmarks and in real-world robotic experiments, demonstrating its utility as a lightweight, extensible, and practical framework to develop learning-based robotic controllers.

Abstract: In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT (Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series (financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability. Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms. Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.</description>

      <title>Branched Broomrape Detection in Tomato Farms Using Satellite Imagery and Time-Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant, viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to identify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest were defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10 percent cloud cover were retained. We processed 12 spectral bands and sun-sensor geometry, computed 20 vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, NDMI), and derived five plant traits (Leaf Area Index, Leaf Chlorophyll Content, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, and Fractional Vegetation Cover) using a neural network calibrated with ground-truth and synthetic data. Trends in Canopy Chlorophyll Content delineated transplanting-to-harvest periods, and phenology was aligned using growing degree days. Vegetation pixels were segmented and used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on 18,874 pixels across 48 growing-degree-day time points. The model achieved 88 percent training accuracy and 87 percent test accuracy, with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. Permutation feature importance ranked NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and a chlorophyll red-edge index as most informative, consistent with the physiological effects of infestation. Results show the promise of satellite-driven time-series modeling for scalable detection of parasitic stress in tomato farms.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated Error Discovery: A Study in Conversational AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although LLM-based conversational agents demonstrate strong fluency and coherence, they still produce undesirable behaviors (errors) that are challenging to prevent from reaching users during deployment. Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide response-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle to identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as those arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user behavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for detecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based approach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by amplifying distance weighting for negative samples and introduce Label-Based Sample Ranking to select highly contrastive examples for better representation learning. SEEED outperforms adapted baselines -- including GPT-4o and Phi-4 -- across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving the accuracy for detecting unknown errors by up to 8 points and demonstrating strong generalization to unknown intent detection.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Selected Image Transformation Techniques for Malware Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a considerable amount of malware research has focused on the use of powerful image-based machine learning techniques, which generally yield impressive results. However, before image-based techniques can be applied to malware, the samples must be converted to images, and there is no generally-accepted approach for doing so. The malware-to-image conversion strategies found in the literature often appear to be ad hoc, with little or no effort made to take into account properties of executable files. In this paper, we experiment with eight distinct malware-to-image conversion techniques, and for each, we test a variety of learning models. We find that several of these image conversion techniques perform similarly across a range of learning models, in spite of the image conversion processes being quite different. These results suggest that the effectiveness of image-based malware classification techniques may depend more on the inherent strengths of image analysis techniques, as opposed to the precise details of the image conversion strategy.</description>

      <title>Variable Selection Using Relative Importance Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although conceptually related, variable selection and relative importance (RI) analysis have been treated quite differently in the literature. While RI is typically used for post-hoc model explanation, this paper explores its potential for variable ranking and filter-based selection before model creation. Specifically, we anticipate strong performance from the RI measures because they incorporate both direct and combined effects of predictors, addressing a key limitation of marginal correlation that ignores dependencies among predictors. We implement and evaluate the RI-based variable selection methods using general dominance (GD), comprehensive relative importance (CRI), and a newly proposed, computationally efficient variant termed CRI.Z.
  We first demonstrate how the RI measures more accurately rank the variables than the marginal correlation, especially when there are suppressed or weak predictors. We then show that predictive models built on these rankings are highly competitive, often outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as the lasso and relaxed lasso. The proposed RI-based methods are particularly effective in challenging cases involving clusters of highly correlated predictors, a setting known to cause failures in many benchmark methods. Although lasso methods have dominated the recent literature on variable selection, our study reveals that the RI-based method is a powerful and competitive alternative. We believe these underutilized tools deserve greater attention in statistics and machine learning communities.

      <title>Physics-informed neural network solves minimal surfaces in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a flexible framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving boundary value problems involving minimal surfaces in curved spacetimes, with a particular emphasis on singularities and moving boundaries. By encoding the underlying physical laws into the loss function and designing network architectures that incorporate the singular behavior and dynamic boundaries, our approach enables robust and accurate solutions to both ordinary and partial differential equations with complex boundary conditions. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through applications to minimal surface problems in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, including examples relevant to the AdS/CFT correspondence (e.g. Wilson loops and gluon scattering amplitudes) popularly used in the context of string theory in theoretical physics. Our methods efficiently handle singularities at boundaries, and also support both "soft" (loss-based) and "hard" (formulation-based) imposition of boundary conditions, including cases where the position of a boundary is promoted to a trainable parameter. The techniques developed here are not limited to high-energy theoretical physics but are broadly applicable to boundary value problems encountered in mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences, wherever singularities and moving boundaries play a critical role.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Metadata-Aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder for Earth Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Earth Observation have focused on large-scale foundation models. However, these models are computationally expensive, limiting their accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate compact architectures as a practical pathway toward smaller general-purpose EO models. We propose a Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder (MoE-MAE) with only 2.5M parameters. The model combines sparse expert routing with geo-temporal conditioning, incorporating imagery alongside latitude/longitude and seasonal/daily cyclic encodings. We pretrain the MoE-MAE on the BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluate embeddings from its frozen encoder using linear probes. Despite its small size, the model competes with much larger architectures, demonstrating that metadata-aware pretraining improves transfer and label efficiency. To further assess generalization, we evaluate on the EuroSAT-Landsat dataset, which lacks explicit metadata, and still observe competitive performance compared to models with hundreds of millions of parameters. These results suggest that compact, metadata-aware MoE-MAEs are an efficient and scalable step toward future EO foundation models.</description>

      <title>Predictive Free Energy Simulations Through Hierarchical Distillation of Quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining the free energies of condensed phase chemical reactions remains computationally prohibitive for high-level quantum mechanical methods. We introduce a hierarchical machine learning framework that bridges this gap by distilling knowledge from a small number of high-fidelity quantum calculations into increasingly coarse-grained, machine-learned quantum Hamiltonians. By retaining explicit electronic degrees of freedom, our approach further enables a faithful embedding of quantum and classical degrees of freedom that captures long-range electrostatics and the quantum response to a classical environment to infinite order. As validation, we compute the proton dissociation constants of weak acids and the kinetic rate of an enzymatic reaction entirely from first principles, reproducing experimental measurements within chemical accuracy or their uncertainties. Our work demonstrates a path to condensed phase simulations of reaction free energies at the highest levels of accuracy with converged statistics.</description>

      <title>Factor Graph Optimization for Leak Localization in Water Distribution Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and localizing leaks in water distribution network systems is an important topic with direct environmental, economic, and social impact. Our paper is the first to explore the use of factor graph optimization techniques for leak localization in water distribution networks, enabling us to perform sensor fusion between pressure and demand sensor readings and to estimate the network's temporal and structural state evolution across all network nodes. The methodology introduces specific water network factors and proposes a new architecture composed of two factor graphs: a leak-free state estimation factor graph and a leak localization factor graph. When a new sensor reading is obtained, unlike Kalman and other interpolation-based methods, which estimate only the current network state, factor graphs update both current and past states. Results on Modena, L-TOWN and synthetic networks show that factor graphs are much faster than nonlinear Kalman-based alternatives such as the UKF, while also providing improvements in localization compared to state-of-the-art estimation-localization approaches. Implementation and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/pirofti/FGLL.</description>

      <title>Hardness, Structural Knowledge, and Opportunity: An Analytical Framework for Modular Performance Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</description>

Abstract: Part I of this work [Gao25] establishes online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online convex optimization to adapt stepsizes in gradient methods. This paper focuses on the practical aspects of OSGM. We leverage the OSGM framework to design new adaptive first-order methods and provide insights into their empirical behavior. The resulting method, OSGM-Best, matches the performance of quasi-Newton variants while requiring less memory and cheaper iterations. We also extend OSGM to nonconvex optimization and outline directions that connect OSGM to existing branches of optimization theory and practice.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear two-time-scale stochastic approximation is widely studied under conditions of bounded variances in noise. Motivated by recent advances that allow for variability linked to the current state or time, we consider state- and time-dependent noises. We show that the Lyapunov function exhibits polynomial convergence rates in both cases, with the rate of polynomial delay depending on the parameters of state- or time-dependent noises. Notably, if the state noise parameters fully approach their limiting value, the Lyapunov function achieves an exponential convergence rate. We provide two numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical findings in the context of stochastic gradient descent with Polyak-Ruppert averaging and stochastic bilevel optimization.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks for Efficient Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity is critical in drug discovery, but experimentally determining it is time-consuming and expensive. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to predict binding affinity, significantly accelerating this process. However, the high-performance requirements and vast datasets involved in affinity prediction demand increasingly large AI models, requiring substantial computational resources and training time. Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. In particular, hybrid quantum-classical models can reduce the number of parameters while maintaining or improving performance compared to classical counterparts. Despite these advantages, challenges persist: why hybrid quantum models achieve these benefits, whether quantum neural networks (QNNs) can replace classical neural networks, and whether such models are feasible on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) that empirically demonstrates the capability to approximate non-linear functions in the latent feature space derived from classical embedding. The primary goal of this study is to achieve a parameter-efficient model in binding affinity prediction while ensuring feasibility on NISQ devices. Numerical results indicate that HQNN achieves comparable or superior performance and parameter efficiency compared to classical neural networks, underscoring its potential as a viable replacement. This study highlights the potential of hybrid QML in computational drug discovery, offering insights into its applicability and advantages in addressing the computational challenges of protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.</description>

      <title>BERT4beam: Large AI Model Enabled Generalized Beamforming Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to emerge as a pivotal enabler for the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems. However, current research efforts regarding large AI models for wireless communications primarily focus on fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks. This paper investigates the large-scale AI model designed for beamforming optimization to adapt and generalize to diverse tasks defined by system utilities and scales. We propose a novel framework based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), termed BERT4beam. We aim to formulate the beamforming optimization problem as a token-level sequence learning task, perform tokenization of the channel state information, construct the BERT model, and conduct task-specific pre-training and fine-tuning strategies. Based on the framework, we propose two BERT-based approaches for single-task and multi-task beamforming optimization, respectively. Both approaches are generalizable for varying user scales. Moreover, the former can adapt to varying system utilities and antenna configurations by re-configuring the input and output module of the BERT model, while the latter, termed UBERT, can directly generalize to diverse tasks, due to a finer-grained tokenization strategy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed approaches can achieve near-optimal performance and outperform existing AI models across various beamforming optimization tasks, showcasing strong adaptability and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based Stochastic Approximation Framework for Nonlinear Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic approximation framework for learning nonlinear operators between infinite-dimensional spaces utilizing general Mercer operator-valued kernels. Our framework encompasses two key classes: (i) compact kernels, which admit discrete spectral decompositions, and (ii) diagonal kernels of the form $K(x,x')=k(x,x')T$, where $k$ is a scalar-valued kernel and $T$ is a positive operator on the output space. This broad setting induces expressive vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that generalize the classical $K=kI$ paradigm, thereby enabling rich structural modeling with rigorous theoretical guarantees. To address target operators lying outside the RKHS, we introduce vector-valued interpolation spaces to precisely quantify misspecification error. Within this framework, we establish dimension-free polynomial convergence rates, demonstrating that nonlinear operator learning can overcome the curse of dimensionality. The use of general operator-valued kernels further allows us to derive rates for intrinsically nonlinear operator learning, going beyond the linear-type behavior inherent in diagonal constructions of $K=kI$. Importantly, this framework accommodates a wide range of operator learning tasks, ranging from integral operators such as Fredholm operators to architectures based on encoder-decoder representations. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>SH-SAS: An Implicit Neural Representation for Complex Spherical-Harmonic Scattering Fields for 3D Synthetic Aperture Sonar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) reconstruction requires recovering both the spatial distribution of acoustic scatterers and their direction-dependent response. Time-domain backprojection is the most common 3D SAS reconstruction algorithm, but it does not model directionality and can suffer from sampling limitations, aliasing, and occlusion. Prior neural volumetric methods applied to synthetic aperture sonar treat each voxel as an isotropic scattering density, not modeling anisotropic returns. We introduce SH-SAS, an implicit neural representation that expresses the complex acoustic scattering field as a set of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. A multi-resolution hash encoder feeds a lightweight MLP that outputs complex SH coefficients up to a specified degree L. The zeroth-order coefficient acts as an isotropic scattering field, which also serves as the density term, while higher orders compactly capture directional scattering with minimal parameter overhead. Because the model predicts the complex amplitude for any transmit-receive baseline, training is performed directly from 1-D time-of-flight signals without the need to beamform intermediate images for supervision. Across synthetic and real SAS (both in-air and underwater) benchmarks, results show that SH-SAS performs better in terms of 3D reconstruction quality and geometric metrics than previous methods.</description>

      <title>What is in a Price? Estimating Willingness-to-Pay with Bayesian Hierarchical Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For premium consumer products, pricing strategy is not about a single number, but about understanding the perceived monetary value of the features that justify a higher cost. This paper proposes a robust methodology to deconstruct a product's price into the tangible value of its constituent parts. We employ Bayesian Hierarchical Conjoint Analysis, a sophisticated statistical technique, to solve this high-stakes business problem using the Apple iPhone as a universally recognizable case study. We first simulate a realistic choice based conjoint survey where consumers choose between different hypothetical iPhone configurations. We then develop a Bayesian Hierarchical Logit Model to infer consumer preferences from this choice data. The core innovation of our model is its ability to directly estimate the Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) in dollars for specific feature upgrades, such as a "Pro" camera system or increased storage. Our results demonstrate that the model successfully recovers the true, underlying feature valuations from noisy data, providing not just a point estimate but a full posterior probability distribution for the dollar value of each feature. This work provides a powerful, practical framework for data-driven product design and pricing strategy, enabling businesses to make more intelligent decisions about which features to build and how to price them.</description>

      <title>Fluid Language Model Benchmarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language model (LM) benchmarking faces several challenges: comprehensive evaluations are costly, benchmarks often fail to measure the intended capabilities, and evaluation quality can degrade due to labeling errors and benchmark saturation. Although various strategies have been proposed to mitigate these issues, they tend to address individual aspects in isolation, neglecting broader questions about overall evaluation quality. Here, we introduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM benchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid Benchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items depends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to each LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model based on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to select evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing in education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the common practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated baselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We examine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation -- and find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them (e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items). Our analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct effects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability space, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance. Overall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved by moving beyond static evaluation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Sensing Aided mmWave Beamforming for V2V Communications with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beamforming techniques are utilized in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication to address the inherent path loss limitation, thereby establishing and maintaining reliable connections. However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduces the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the features individually from the visual and GPS coordinates sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real-world multi-modal sensing and communication dataset. From the experiment, we observe that the proposed framework achieves up to 77.58% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, outperforms single modalities, incurs roughly as low as 2.32 dB average power loss, and considerably reduces the beam searching space overheads by 76.56% for top-15 beams with respect to standard defined approach.</description>

      <title>WildSmoke: Ready-to-Use Dynamic 3D Smoke Assets from a Single Video in the Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a pipeline to extract and reconstruct dynamic 3D smoke assets from a single in-the-wild video, and further integrate interactive simulation for smoke design and editing. Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but also enables diverse and realistic editing of fluid dynamics by simulating our smoke assets. We provide our models, data, and 4D smoke assets at [https://autumnyq.github.io/WildSmoke](https://autumnyq.github.io/WildSmoke).</description>

      <title>Maximum diversity, weighting and invariants of time series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnitude, obtained as a special case of Euler characteristic of enriched category, represents a sense of the size of metric spaces and is related to classical notions such as cardinality, dimension, and volume. While the studies have explained the meaning of magnitude from various perspectives, continuity also gives a valuable view of magnitude. Based on established results about continuity of magnitude and maximum diversity, this article focuses on continuity of weighting, a distribution whose totality is magnitude, and its variation corresponding to maximum diversity. Meanwhile, recent studies also illuminated the connection between magnitude and data analysis by applying magnitude theory to point clouds representing the data or the set of model parameters. This article will also provide an application for time series analysis by introducing a new kind of invariants of periodic time series, where the invariance follows directly from the continuity results. As a use-case, a simple machine learning experiment is conducted with real-world data, in which the suggested invariants improved the performance.</description>

      <title>RoVerFly: Robust and Versatile Learning-based Control of Quadrotor Across Payload Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing robust controllers for precise, arbitrary trajectory tracking with quadrotors is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and underactuation, and becomes harder with flexible cable-suspended payloads that introduce extra degrees of freedom and hybridness. Classical model-based methods offer stability guarantees but require extensive tuning and often do not adapt when the configuration changes, such as when a payload is added or removed, or when the payload mass or cable length varies. We present RoVerFly, a unified learning-based control framework in which a reinforcement learning (RL) policy serves as a robust and versatile tracking controller for standard quadrotors and for cable-suspended payload systems across a range of configurations. Trained with task and domain randomization, the controller is resilient to disturbances and varying dynamics. It achieves strong zero-shot generalization across payload settings, including no payload as well as varying mass and cable length, without controller switching or re-tuning, while retaining the interpretability and structure of a feedback tracking controller.

      <title>Your Compiler is Backdooring Your Model: Understanding and Exploiting Compilation Inconsistency Vulnerabilities in Deep Learning Compilers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) compilers are core infrastructure in modern DL systems, offering flexibility and scalability beyond vendor-specific libraries. This work uncovers a fundamental vulnerability in their design: can an official, unmodified compiler alter a model's semantics during compilation and introduce hidden backdoors? We study both adversarial and natural settings. In the adversarial case, we craft benign models where triggers have no effect pre-compilation but become effective backdoors after compilation. Tested on six models, three commercial compilers, and two hardware platforms, our attack yields 100% success on triggered inputs while preserving normal accuracy and remaining undetected by state-of-the-art detectors. The attack generalizes across compilers, hardware, and floating-point settings. In the natural setting, we analyze the top 100 HuggingFace models (including one with 220M+ downloads) and find natural triggers in 31 models. This shows that compilers can introduce risks even without adversarial manipulation.
  Our results reveal an overlooked threat: unmodified DL compilers can silently alter model semantics. To our knowledge, this is the first work to expose inherent security risks in DL compiler design, opening a new direction for secure and trustworthy ML.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Variational Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field in computer science that has seen considerable progress in recent years, especially in machine learning. By harnessing the principles of quantum physics, it can surpass the limitations of classical algorithms. However, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), which rely on adjustable parameters, often face the barren plateau phenomenon, hindering optimization. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) is a recent concept in classical machine learning that has led to notable improvements in parameter efficiency for neural networks. It states that within a large network, a smaller, more efficient subnetwork, or ''winning ticket,'' can achieve comparable performance, potentially circumventing plateau challenges. In this work, we investigate whether this idea can apply to VQCs. We show that the weak LTH holds for VQCs, revealing winning tickets that retain just 26.0\% of the original parameters. For the strong LTH, where a pruning mask is learned without any training, we discovered a winning ticket in a binary VQC, achieving 100\% accuracy with only 45\% of the weights. These findings indicate that LTH may mitigate barren plateaus by reducing parameter counts while preserving performance, thus enhancing the efficiency of VQCs in quantum machine learning tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to address computational problems in ways that differ fundamentally from classical approaches. While current quantum hardware remains error-prone and limited in scale, Variational Quantum Circuits offer a noise-resilient framework suitable for today's devices. The performance of these circuits strongly depends on the underlying architecture of their parameterized quantum components. Identifying efficient, hardware-compatible quantum circuit architectures -- known as Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) -- is therefore essential. Manual QAS is complex and error-prone, motivating efforts to automate it. Among various automated strategies, Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains underexplored, particularly in Quantum Machine Learning contexts. This work introduces RL-QAS, a framework that applies RL to discover effective circuit architectures for classification tasks. We evaluate RL-QAS using the Iris and binary MNIST datasets. The agent autonomously discovers low-complexity circuit designs that achieve high test accuracy. Our results show that RL is a viable approach for automated architecture search in quantum machine learning. However, applying RL-QAS to more complex tasks will require further refinement of the search strategy and performance evaluation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Predictable Compression Failures: Why Language Models Actually Hallucinate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models perform near-Bayesian inference yet violate permutation invariance on exchangeable data. We resolve this by showing transformers minimize expected conditional description length (cross-entropy) over orderings, $\mathbb{E}_\pi[\ell(Y \mid \Gamma_\pi(X))]$, which admits a Kolmogorov-complexity interpretation up to additive constants, rather than the permutation-invariant description length $\ell(Y \mid X)$. This makes them Bayesian in expectation, not in realization. We derive (i) a Quantified Martingale Violation bound showing order-induced deviations scale as $O(\log n)$ with constants; (ii) the Expectation-level Decompression Law linking information budgets to reliability for Bernoulli predicates; and (iii) deployable planners (B2T/RoH/ISR) for answer/abstain decisions. Empirically, permutation dispersion follows $a+b\ln n$ (Qwen2-7B $b \approx 0.377$, Llama-3.1-8B $b \approx 0.147$); permutation mixtures improve ground-truth likelihood/accuracy; and randomized dose-response shows hallucinations drop by $\sim 0.13$ per additional nat. A pre-specified audit with a fixed ISR=1.0 achieves near-0\% hallucinations via calibrated refusal at 24\% abstention. The framework turns hallucinations into predictable compression failures and enables principled information budgeting.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Meter Tracking in Carnatic Music using Deep Learning Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beat and downbeat tracking, jointly referred to as Meter Tracking, is a fundamental task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Deep learning models have far surpassed traditional signal processing and classical machine learning approaches in this domain, particularly for Western (Eurogenetic) genres, where large annotated datasets are widely available. These systems, however, perform less reliably on underrepresented musical traditions. Carnatic music, a rich tradition from the Indian subcontinent, is renowned for its rhythmic intricacy and unique metrical structures (t\=alas). The most notable prior work on meter tracking in this context employed probabilistic Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). The performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models on Carnatic music, however, remains largely unexplored.
  In this study, we evaluate two models for meter tracking in Carnatic music: the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), a lightweight architecture that has been successfully adapted for Latin rhythms, and Beat This!, a transformer-based model designed for broad stylistic coverage without the need for post-processing. Replicating the experimental setup of the DBN baseline on the Carnatic Music Rhythm (CMR$_f$) dataset, we systematically assess the performance of these models in a directly comparable setting. We further investigate adaptation strategies, including fine-tuning the models on Carnatic data and the use of musically informed parameters. Results show that while off-the-shelf models do not always outperform the DBN, their performance improves substantially with transfer learning, matching or surpassing the baseline. These findings indicate that SOTA deep learning models can be effectively adapted to underrepresented traditions, paving the way for more inclusive and broadly applicable meter tracking systems.</description>

      <title>From PowerSGD to PowerSGD+: Low-Rank Gradient Compression for Distributed Optimization with Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank gradient compression methods, such as PowerSGD, have gained attention in communication-efficient distributed optimization. However, the convergence guarantees of PowerSGD remain unclear, particularly in stochastic settings. In this paper, we show that PowerSGD does not always converge to the optimal solution and provide a clear counterexample to support this finding. To address this, we introduce PowerSGD+, which periodically updates the projection subspace via singular value decomposition, ensuring that it remains aligned with the optimal subspace. We prove that PowerSGD+ converges under standard assumptions and validate its effectiveness through empirical evaluation on large language model tasks.</description>

      <title>Derivative-informed Graph Convolutional Autoencoder with Phase Classification for the Lifshitz-Petrich Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lifshitz-Petrich (LP) model is a classical model for describing complex spatial patterns such as quasicrystals and multiphase structures. Solving and classifying the solutions of the LP model is challenging due to the presence of high-order gradient terms and the long-range orientational order characteristic of the quasicrystals. To address these challenges, we propose a Derivative-informed Graph Convolutional Autoencoder (DiGCA) to classify the multi-component multi-state solutions of the LP model. The classifier consists of two stages. In the offline stage, the DiGCA phase classifier innovatively incorporates both solutions and their derivatives for training a graph convolutional autoencoder which effectively captures intricate spatial dependencies while significantly reducing the dimensionality of the solution space. In the online phase, the framework employs a neural network classifier to efficiently categorize encoded solutions into distinct phase diagrams. The numerical results demonstrate that the DiGCA phase classifier accurately solves the LP model, classifies its solutions, and rapidly generates detailed phase diagrams in a robust manner, offering significant improvements in both efficiency and accuracy over traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Network Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network representation learning seeks to embed networks into a low-dimensional space while preserving the structural and semantic properties, thereby facilitating downstream tasks such as classification, trait prediction, edge identification, and community detection. Motivated by challenges in brain connectivity data analysis that is characterized by subject-specific, high-dimensional, and sparse networks that lack node or edge covariates, we propose a novel contrastive learning-based statistical approach for network edge embedding, which we name as Adaptive Contrastive Edge Representation Learning (ACERL). It builds on two key components: contrastive learning of augmented network pairs, and a data-driven adaptive random masking mechanism. We establish the non-asymptotic error bounds, and show that our method achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate for edge representation learning. We further demonstrate the applicability of the learned representation in multiple downstream tasks, including network classification, important edge detection, and community detection, and establish the corresponding theoretical guarantees. We validate our method through both synthetic data and real brain connectivities studies, and show its competitive performance compared to the baseline method of sparse principal components analysis.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation Reservoir Computing for Dynamical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple and scalable implementation of next-generation reservoir computing for modeling dynamical systems from time series data. Our approach uses a pseudorandom nonlinear projection of time-delay embedded input, allowing an arbitrary dimension of the feature space, thus providing a flexible alternative to the polynomial-based projections used in previous next-generation reservoir computing variants. We apply the method to benchmark tasks -- including attractor reconstruction and bifurcation diagram estimation -- using only partial and noisy observations. We also include an exploratory example of estimating asymptotic oscillation phases. The models remain stable over long rollouts and generalize beyond training data. This framework enables the precise control of system state and is well suited for surrogate modeling and digital twin applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond Instance Consistency: Investigating View Diversity in Self-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) conventionally relies on the instance consistency paradigm, assuming that different views of the same image can be treated as positive pairs. However, this assumption breaks down for non-iconic data, where different views may contain distinct objects or semantic information. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SSL when instance consistency is not guaranteed. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that SSL can still learn meaningful representations even when positive pairs lack strict instance consistency. Furthermore, our analysis further reveals that increasing view diversity, by enforcing zero overlapping or using smaller crop scales, can enhance downstream performance on classification and dense prediction tasks. However, excessive diversity is found to reduce effectiveness, suggesting an optimal range for view diversity. To quantify this, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as an estimator to measure mutual information between views, finding that moderate EMD values correlate with improved SSL learning, providing insights for future SSL framework design. We validate our findings across a range of settings, highlighting their robustness and applicability on diverse data sources.</description>

      <title>Some Robustness Properties of Label Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that learning procedures that rely on aggregated labels, e.g., label information distilled from noisy responses, enjoy robustness properties impossible without data cleaning. This robustness appears in several ways. In the context of risk consistency -- when one takes the standard approach in machine learning of minimizing a surrogate (typically convex) loss in place of a desired task loss (such as the zero-one mis-classification error) -- procedures using label aggregation obtain stronger consistency guarantees than those even possible using raw labels. And while classical statistical scenarios of fitting perfectly-specified models suggest that incorporating all possible information -- modeling uncertainty in labels -- is statistically efficient, consistency fails for ``standard'' approaches as soon as a loss to be minimized is even slightly mis-specified. Yet procedures leveraging aggregated information still converge to optimal classifiers, highlighting how incorporating a fuller view of the data analysis pipeline, from collection to model-fitting to prediction time, can yield a more robust methodology by refining noisy signals.</description>

      <title>Quantum Graph Attention Networks: Trainable Quantum Encoders for Inductive Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Quantum Graph Attention Networks (QGATs) as trainable quantum encoders for inductive learning on graphs, extending the Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNN) framework. QGATs leverage parameterized quantum circuits to encode node features and neighborhood structures, with quantum attention mechanisms modulating the contribution of each neighbor via dynamically learned unitaries. This allows for expressive, locality-aware quantum representations that can generalize across unseen graph instances. We evaluate our approach on the QM9 dataset, targeting the prediction of various chemical properties. Our experiments compare classical and quantum graph neural networks-with and without attention layers-demonstrating that attention consistently improves performance in both paradigms. Notably, we observe that quantum attention yields increasing benefits as graph size grows, with QGATs significantly outperforming their non-attentive quantum counterparts on larger molecular graphs. Furthermore, for smaller graphs, QGATs achieve predictive accuracy comparable to classical GAT models, highlighting their viability as expressive quantum encoders. These results show the potential of quantum attention mechanisms to enhance the inductive capacity of QGNN in chemistry and beyond.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generalization in Vision-Language-Action Models by Preserving Pretrained Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models (VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations, generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Trading-R1: Financial Trading with LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing professional, structured reasoning on par with human financial analysts and traders remains a central challenge in AI for finance, where markets demand interpretability and trust. Traditional time-series models lack explainability, while LLMs face challenges in turning natural-language analysis into disciplined, executable trades. Although reasoning LLMs have advanced in step-by-step planning and verification, their application to risk-sensitive financial decisions is underexplored. We present Trading-R1, a financially-aware model that incorporates strategic thinking and planning for comprehensive thesis composition, facts-grounded analysis, and volatility-adjusted decision making. Trading-R1 aligns reasoning with trading principles through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a three-stage easy-to-hard curriculum. Training uses Tauric-TR1-DB, a 100k-sample corpus spanning 18 months, 14 equities, and five heterogeneous financial data sources. Evaluated on six major equities and ETFs, Trading-R1 demonstrates improved risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdowns compared to both open-source and proprietary instruction-following models as well as reasoning models. The system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support disciplined and interpretable trading decisions. Trading-R1 Terminal will be released at https://github.com/TauricResearch/Trading-R1.</description>

      <title>A Particle-Flow Algorithm for Free-Support Wasserstein Barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter extends the Euclidean mean to the space of probability measures by minimizing the weighted sum of squared 2-Wasserstein distances. We develop a free-support algorithm for computing Wasserstein barycenters that avoids entropic regularization and instead follows the formal Riemannian geometry of Wasserstein space. In our approach, barycenter atoms evolve as particles advected by averaged optimal-transport displacements, with barycentric projections of optimal transport plans used in place of Monge maps when the latter do not exist. This yields a geometry-aware particle-flow update that preserves sharp features of the Wasserstein barycenter while remaining computationally tractable. We establish theoretical guarantees, including consistency of barycentric projections, monotone descent and convergence to stationary points, stability with respect to perturbations of the inputs, and resolution consistency as the number of atoms increases. Empirical studies on averaging probability distributions, Bayesian posterior aggregation, image prototypes and classification, and large-scale clustering demonstrate accuracy and scalability of the proposed particle-flow approach, positioning it as a principled alternative to both linear programming and regularized solvers.</description>

      <title>Disentanglement of Biological and Technical Factors via Latent Space Rotation in Clinical Imaging Improves Disease Pattern Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying new disease-related patterns in medical imaging data with the help of machine learning enlarges the vocabulary of recognizable findings. This supports diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, image appearance varies not only due to biological differences, but also due to imaging technology linked to vendors, scanning- or re- construction parameters. The resulting domain shifts impedes data representation learning strategies and the discovery of biologically meaningful cluster appearances. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach to actively learn the domain shift via post-hoc rotation of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of biological and technical factors. Results on real-world heterogeneous clinical data showcase that the learned disentangled representation leads to stable clusters representing tissue-types across different acquisition settings. Cluster consistency is improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to the entangled representation, outperforming four state-of-the-art harmonization methods. When using the clusters to quantify tissue composition on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients, the learned profiles enhance Cox survival prediction. This indicates that the proposed label-free framework facilitates biomarker discovery in multi-center routine imaging data.

      <title>CEMTM: Contextual Embedding-based Multimodal Topic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities. Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as scientific articles.</description>

      <title>Modality-Aware Infrared and Visible Image Fusion with Target-Aware Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a fundamental task in multi-modal perception that aims to integrate complementary structural and textural cues from different spectral domains. In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks such as object detection and scene understanding.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Scaling of Vision-Language-Action Models from Edge to Cloud GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.</description>

      <title>RAPTOR: A Foundation Policy for Quadrotor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans are remarkably data-efficient when adapting to new unseen conditions, like driving a new car. In contrast, modern robotic control systems, like neural network policies trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), are highly specialized for single environments. Because of this overfitting, they are known to break down even under small differences like the Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) gap and require system identification and retraining for even minimal changes to the system. In this work, we present RAPTOR, a method for training a highly adaptive foundation policy for quadrotor control. Our method enables training a single, end-to-end neural-network policy to control a wide variety of quadrotors. We test 10 different real quadrotors from 32 g to 2.4 kg that also differ in motor type (brushed vs. brushless), frame type (soft vs. rigid), propeller type (2/3/4-blade), and flight controller (PX4/Betaflight/Crazyflie/M5StampFly). We find that a tiny, three-layer policy with only 2084 parameters is sufficient for zero-shot adaptation to a wide variety of platforms. The adaptation through In-Context Learning is made possible by using a recurrence in the hidden layer. The policy is trained through a novel Meta-Imitation Learning algorithm, where we sample 1000 quadrotors and train a teacher policy for each of them using Reinforcement Learning. Subsequently, the 1000 teachers are distilled into a single, adaptive student policy. We find that within milliseconds, the resulting foundation policy adapts zero-shot to unseen quadrotors. We extensively test the capabilities of the foundation policy under numerous conditions (trajectory tracking, indoor/outdoor, wind disturbance, poking, different propellers).</description>

      <title>Preconditioned subgradient method for composite optimization: overparameterization and fast convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composite optimization problems involve minimizing the composition of a smooth map with a convex function. Such objectives arise in numerous data science and signal processing applications, including phase retrieval, blind deconvolution, and collaborative filtering. The subgradient method achieves local linear convergence when the composite loss is well-conditioned. However, if the smooth map is, in a certain sense, ill-conditioned or overparameterized, the subgradient method exhibits much slower sublinear convergence even when the convex function is well-conditioned. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Levenberg-Morrison-Marquardt subgradient method that converges linearly under mild regularity conditions at a rate determined solely by the convex function. Further, we demonstrate that these regularity conditions hold for several problems of practical interest, including square-variable formulations, matrix sensing, and tensor factorization. Numerical experiments illustrate the benefits of our method.</description>

      <title>SafeDiver: Cooperative AUV-USV Assisted Diver Communication via Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As underwater human activities are increasing, the demand for underwater communication service presents a significant challenge. Existing underwater diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable and high-speed communication for divers.</description>

      <title>Learning Majority-to-Minority Transformations with MMD and Triplet Loss for Imbalanced Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance in supervised classification often degrades model performance by biasing predictions toward the majority class, particularly in critical applications such as medical diagnosis and fraud detection. Traditional oversampling techniques, including SMOTE and its variants, generate synthetic minority samples via local interpolation but fail to capture global data distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Deep generative models based on GANs offer richer distribution modeling yet suffer from training instability and mode collapse under severe imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an oversampling framework that learns a parametric transformation to map majority samples into the minority distribution. Our approach minimizes the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between transformed and true minority samples for global alignment, and incorporates a triplet loss regularizer to enforce boundary awareness by guiding synthesized samples toward challenging borderline regions. We evaluate our method on 29 synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements over classical and generative baselines in AUROC, G-mean, F1-score, and MCC. These results confirm the robustness, computational efficiency, and practical utility of the proposed framework for imbalanced classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Predictive Resource Management in Complex Science Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collaborative efforts of large communities in science experiments, often comprising thousands of global members, reflect a monumental commitment to exploration and discovery. Recently, advanced and complex data processing has gained increasing importance in science experiments. Data processing workflows typically consist of multiple intricate steps, and the precise specification of resource requirements is crucial for each step to allocate optimal resources for effective processing. Estimating resource requirements in advance is challenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels among community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing options. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially processing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from actual processing profiles before completing the entire step. While this two-staged approach enables processing on optimal resources for most of the workflow, it has drawbacks such as initial inaccuracies leading to potential failures and suboptimal resource usage, along with overhead from waiting for initial processing completion, which is critical for fast-turnaround analyses. In this context, our study introduces a novel pipeline of machine learning models within a comprehensive workflow management system, the Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA) system. These models employ advanced machine learning techniques to predict key resource requirements, overcoming challenges posed by limited upfront knowledge of characteristics at each step. Accurate forecasts of resource requirements enable informed and proactive decision-making in workflow management, enhancing the efficiency of handling diverse, complex workflows across heterogeneous resources.</description>

      <title>PeruMedQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on Peruvian Medical Exams -- Dataset Construction and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12 medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS: medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with &lt;10 billion parameters exhibited &lt;60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results &lt;50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all LLMs with &lt;10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.</description>

      <title>E-ROBOT: a dimension-free method for robust statistics and machine learning via Schr\"odinger bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Entropic-regularized Robust Optimal Transport (E-ROBOT) framework, a novel method that combines the robustness of ROBOT with the computational and statistical benefits of entropic regularization. We show that, rooted in the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem theory, E-ROBOT defines the robust Sinkhorn divergence $\overline{W}_{\varepsilon,\lambda}$, where the parameter $\lambda$ controls robustness and $\varepsilon$ governs the regularization strength. Letting $n\in \mathbb{N}$ denote the sample size, a central theoretical contribution is establishing that the sample complexity of $\overline{W}_{\varepsilon,\lambda}$ is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality that plagues standard ROBOT. This dimension-free property unlocks the use of $\overline{W}_{\varepsilon,\lambda}$ as a loss function in large-dimensional statistical and machine learning tasks. With this regard, we demonstrate its utility through four applications: goodness-of-fit testing; computation of barycenters for corrupted 2D and 3D shapes; definition of gradient flows; and image colour transfer. From the computation standpoint, a perk of our novel method is that it can be easily implemented by modifying existing (\texttt{Python}) routines. From the theoretical standpoint, our work opens the door to many research directions in statistics and machine learning: we discuss some of them.</description>

      <title>Learning Singularity-Encoded Green's Functions with Application to Iterative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Green's function provides an inherent connection between theoretical analysis and numerical methods for elliptic partial differential equations, and general absence of its closed-form expression necessitates surrogate modeling to guide the design of effective solvers. Unfortunately, numerical computation of Green's function remains challenging due to its doubled dimensionality and intrinsic singularity. In this paper, we present a novel singularity-encoded learning approach to resolve these problems in an unsupervised fashion. Our method embeds the Green's function within a one-order higher-dimensional space by encoding its prior estimate as an augmented variable, followed by a neural network parametrization to manage the increased dimensionality. By projecting the trained neural network solution back onto the original domain, our deep surrogate model exploits its spectral bias to accelerate conventional iterative schemes, serving either as a preconditioner or as part of a hybrid solver. The effectiveness of our proposed method is empirically verified through numerical experiments with two and four dimensional Green's functions, achieving satisfactory resolution of singularities and acceleration of iterative solvers.</description>

      <title>AMLNet: A Knowledge-Based Multi-Agent Framework to Generate and Detect Realistic Money Laundering Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) research is constrained by the lack of publicly shareable, regulation-aligned transaction datasets. We present AMLNet, a knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The generator produces 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (approximately 0.16\% laundering-positive) spanning core laundering phases (placement, layering, integration) and advanced typologies (e.g., structuring, adaptive threshold behavior). Regulatory alignment reaches 75\% based on AUSTRAC rule coverage (Section 4.2), while a composite technical fidelity score of 0.75 summarizes temporal, structural, and behavioral realism components (Section 4.4). The detection ensemble achieves F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on the internal test partitions of AMLNet and adapts to the external SynthAML dataset, indicating architectural generalizability across different synthetic generation paradigms. We provide multi-dimensional evaluation (regulatory, temporal, network, behavioral) and release the dataset (Version 1.0, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736515), to advance reproducible and regulation-conscious AML experimentation.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Content from Style to Overcome Shortcut Learning: A Hybrid Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters shortcut dependency. To address this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection.</description>

      <title>Scaling to Multimodal and Multichannel Heart Sound Classification: Fine-Tuning Wav2Vec 2.0 with Synthetic and Augmented Biosignals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48\%, 93.05\%, 93.63\%, 92.48\%, 94.93\% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14\%, 92.21\%, 94.35\%, 90.10\%, 95.12\% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13\% accuracy, 74.25\% UAR, 86.47\% sensitivity, 62.04\% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</description>

      <title>A Controllable 3D Deepfake Generation Framework with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel 3D deepfake generation framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables realistic, identity-preserving face swapping and reenactment in a fully controllable 3D space. Compared to conventional 2D deepfake approaches that suffer from geometric inconsistencies and limited generalization to novel view, our method combines a parametric head model with dynamic Gaussian representations to support multi-view consistent rendering, precise expression control, and seamless background integration. To address editing challenges in point-based representations, we explicitly separate the head and background Gaussians and use pre-trained 2D guidance to optimize the facial region across views. We further introduce a repair module to enhance visual consistency under extreme poses and expressions. Experiments on NeRSemble and additional evaluation videos demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D approaches in identity preservation, as well as pose and expression consistency, while significantly outperforming them in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency. Our approach bridges the gap between 3D modeling and deepfake synthesis, enabling new directions for scene-aware, controllable, and immersive visual forgeries, revealing the threat that emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting technique could be used for manipulation attacks.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces SpaPool, a novel pooling method that combines the strengths of both dense and sparse techniques for a graph neural network. SpaPool groups vertices into an adaptive number of clusters, leveraging the benefits of both dense and sparse approaches. It aims to maintain the structural integrity of the graph while reducing its size efficiently. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SpaPool achieves competitive performance compared to existing pooling techniques and excels particularly on small-scale graphs.

      <description>arXiv:2509.11698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion instruction is a crucial task that helps athletes refine their technique by analyzing movements and providing corrective guidance. Although recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding, generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative guidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the differences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and physical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we illustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data. Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of directions merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information. CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on boxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their corresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions.

      <title>EMeRALDS: Electronic Medical Record Driven Automated Lung Nodule Detection and Classification in Thoracic CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, primarily due to delayed diagnosis and poor early detection. This study aims to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) for the accurate detection and classification of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) scans.
  Methods: We propose an end-to-end CAD pipeline consisting of two modules: (i) a detection module (CADe) based on the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in which the standard visual prompt is replaced with a text prompt encoded by CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and (ii) a diagnosis module (CADx) that calculates similarity scores between segmented nodules and radiomic features. To add clinical context, synthetic electronic medical records (EMRs) were generated using radiomic assessments by expert radiologists and combined with similarity scores for final classification. The method was tested on the publicly available LIDC-IDRI dataset (1,018 CT scans).
  Results: The proposed approach demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot lung nodule analysis. The CADe module achieved a Dice score of 0.92 and an IoU of 0.85 for nodule segmentation. The CADx module attained a specificity of 0.97 for malignancy classification, surpassing existing fully supervised methods.
  Conclusions: The integration of VLMs with radiomics and synthetic EMRs allows for accurate and clinically relevant CAD of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. The proposed system shows strong potential to enhance early lung cancer detection, increase diagnostic confidence, and improve patient management in routine clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Neural Audio Codecs for Prompt-Driven Universal Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-guided source separation supports flexible audio editing across media and assistive applications, but existing models like AudioSep are too compute-heavy for edge deployment. Neural audio codec (NAC) models such as CodecFormer and SDCodec are compute-efficient but limited to fixed-class separation. We introduce CodecSep, the first NAC-based model for on-device universal, text-driven separation. CodecSep combines DAC compression with a Transformer masker modulated by CLAP-derived FiLM parameters. Across six open-domain benchmarks under matched training/prompt protocols, \textbf{CodecSep} surpasses \textbf{AudioSep} in separation fidelity (SI-SDR) while remaining competitive in perceptual quality (ViSQOL) and matching or exceeding fixed-stem baselines (TDANet, CodecFormer, SDCodec). In code-stream deployments, it needs just 1.35~GMACs end-to-end -- approximately $54\times$ less compute ($25\times$ architecture-only) than spectrogram-domain separators like AudioSep -- while remaining fully bitstream-compatible.</description>

      <title>Analysing Python Machine Learning Notebooks with Moose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) code, particularly within notebooks, often exhibits lower quality compared to traditional software. Bad practices arise at three distinct levels: general Python coding conventions, the organizational structure of the notebook itself, and ML-specific aspects such as reproducibility and correct API usage. However, existing analysis tools typically focus on only one of these levels and struggle to capture ML-specific semantics, limiting their ability to detect issues. This paper introduces Vespucci Linter, a static analysis tool with multi-level capabilities, built on Moose and designed to address this challenge. Leveraging a metamodeling approach that unifies the notebook's structural elements with Python code entities, our linter enables a more contextualized analysis to identify issues across all three levels. We implemented 22 linting rules derived from the literature and applied our tool to a corpus of 5,000 notebooks from the Kaggle platform. The results reveal violations at all levels, validating the relevance of our multi-level approach and demonstrating Vespucci Linter's potential to improve the quality and reliability of ML development in notebook environments.</description>

      <title>User eXperience Perception Insights Dataset (UXPID): Synthetic User Feedback from Public Industrial Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Customer feedback in industrial forums reflect a rich but underexplored source of insight into real-world product experience. These publicly shared discussions offer an organic view of user expectations, frustrations, and success stories shaped by the specific contexts of use. Yet, harnessing this information for systematic analysis remains challenging due to the unstructured and domain-specific nature of the content. The lack of structure and specialized vocabulary makes it difficult for traditional data analysis techniques to accurately interpret, categorize, and quantify the feedback, thereby limiting its potential to inform product development and support strategies. To address these challenges, this paper presents the User eXperience Perception Insights Dataset (UXPID), a collection of 7130 artificially synthesized and anonymized user feedback branches extracted from a public industrial automation forum. Each JavaScript object notation (JSON) record contains multi-post comments related to specific hardware and software products, enriched with metadata and contextual conversation data. Leveraging a large language model (LLM), each branch is systematically analyzed and annotated for UX insights, user expectations, severity and sentiment ratings, and topic classifications. The UXPID dataset is designed to facilitate research in user requirements, user experience (UX) analysis, and AI-driven feedback processing, particularly where privacy and licensing restrictions limit access to real-world data. UXPID supports the training and evaluation of transformer-based models for tasks such as issue detection, sentiment analysis, and requirements extraction in the context of technical forums.</description>

      <title>Synthetic vs. Real Training Data for Visual Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how the performance of visual navigation policies trained in simulation compares to policies trained with real-world data. Performance degradation of simulator-trained policies is often significant when they are evaluated in the real world. However, despite this well-known sim-to-real gap, we demonstrate that simulator-trained policies can match the performance of their real-world-trained counterparts.
  Central to our approach is a navigation policy architecture that bridges the sim-to-real appearance gap by leveraging pretrained visual representations and runs real-time on robot hardware. Evaluations on a wheeled mobile robot show that the proposed policy, when trained in simulation, outperforms its real-world-trained version by 31% and the prior state-of-the-art methods by 50% in navigation success rate. Policy generalization is verified by deploying the same model onboard a drone.
  Our results highlight the importance of diverse image encoder pretraining for sim-to-real generalization, and identify on-policy learning as a key advantage of simulated training over training with real data.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Analysis of Text-Conditioned AI-Generated Music: A Case Study with Suno and Udio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online AI platforms for creating music from text prompts (AI music), such as Suno and Udio, are now being used by hundreds of thousands of users. Some AI music is appearing in advertising, and even charting, in multiple countries. How are these platforms being used? What subjects are inspiring their users? This article answers these questions for Suno and Udio using a large collection of songs generated by users of these platforms from May to October 2024. Using a combination of state-of-the-art text embedding models, dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, we analyze the prompts, tags and lyrics, and automatically annotate and display the processed data in interactive plots. Our results reveal prominent themes in lyrics, language preference, prompting strategies, as well as peculiar attempts at steering models through the use of metatags. To promote the musicological study of the developing cultural practice of AI-generated music we share our code and resources.</description>

      <title>ProteuS: A Generative Approach for Simulating Concept Drift in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial markets are complex, non-stationary systems where the underlying data distributions can shift over time, a phenomenon known as regime changes, as well as concept drift in the machine learning literature. These shifts, often triggered by major economic events, pose a significant challenge for traditional statistical and machine learning models. A fundamental problem in developing and validating adaptive algorithms is the lack of a ground truth in real-world financial data, making it difficult to evaluate a model's ability to detect and recover from these drifts. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel framework, named ProteuS, for generating semi-synthetic financial time series with pre-defined structural breaks. Our methodology involves fitting ARMA-GARCH models to real-world ETF data to capture distinct market regimes, and then simulating realistic, gradual, and abrupt transitions between them. The resulting datasets, which include a comprehensive set of technical indicators, provide a controlled environment with a known ground truth of regime changes. An analysis of the generated data confirms the complexity of the task, revealing significant overlap between the different market states. We aim to provide the research community with a tool for the rigorous evaluation of concept drift detection and adaptation mechanisms, paving the way for more robust financial forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Bridging Vision Language Models and Symbolic Grounding for Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial, temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs (SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.</description>

      <title>Learning Representations in Video Game Agents with Supervised Contrastive Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Supervised Contrastive Learning (SupCon) to Imitation Learning (IL), with a focus on learning more effective state representations for agents in video game environments. The goal is to obtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the action-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship from the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the demonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead. We propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output spaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of actions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal, and multiple 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster learning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models trained only with supervised action prediction loss functions.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-SARIMA-Transformer: A Hybrid Model for Rainfall Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops and evaluates a novel hybridWavelet SARIMA Transformer, WST framework to forecast using monthly rainfall across five meteorological subdivisions of Northeast India over the 1971 to 2023 period. The approach employs the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform, MODWT with four wavelet families such as, Haar, Daubechies, Symlet, Coiflet etc. to achieve shift invariant, multiresolution decomposition of the rainfall series. Linear and seasonal components are modeled using Seasonal ARIMA, SARIMA, while nonlinear components are modeled by a Transformer network, and forecasts are reconstructed via inverse MODWT. Comprehensive validation using an 80 is to 20 train test split and multiple performance indices such as, RMSE, MAE, SMAPE, Willmotts d, Skill Score, Percent Bias, Explained Variance, and Legates McCabes E1 demonstrates the superiority of the Haar-based hybrid model, WHST. Across all subdivisions, WHST consistently achieved lower forecast errors, stronger agreement with observed rainfall, and unbiased predictions compared with stand alone SARIMA, stand-alone Transformer, and two-stage wavelet hybrids. Residual adequacy was confirmed through the Ljung Box test, while Taylor diagrams provided an integrated assessment of correlation, variance fidelity, and RMSE, further reinforcing the robustness of the proposed approach. The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating multiresolution signal decomposition with complementary linear and deep learning models for hydroclimatic forecasting. Beyond rainfall, the proposed WST framework offers a scalable methodology for forecasting complex environmental time series, with direct implications for flood risk management, water resources planning, and climate adaptation strategies in data-sparse and climate-sensitive regions.</description>

      <title>High Effort, Low Gain: Fundamental Limits of Active Learning for Linear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of identifying an unknown linear dynamical system given a finite hypothesis class. In particular, we analyze the effect of the excitation input on the sample complexity of identifying the true system with high probability. To this end, we present sample complexity lower bounds that capture the choice of the selected excitation input. The sample complexity lower bound gives rise to a system theoretic condition to determine the potential benefit of experiment design. Informed by the analysis of the sample complexity lower bound, we propose a persistent excitation (PE) condition tailored to the considered setting, which we then use to establish sample complexity upper bounds. Notably, the \acs{PE} condition is weaker than in the case of an infinite hypothesis class and allows analyzing different excitation inputs modularly. Crucially, the lower and upper bounds share the same dependency on key problem parameters. Finally, we leverage these insights to propose an active learning algorithm that sequentially excites the system optimally with respect to the current estimate, and provide sample complexity guarantees for the presented algorithm. Concluding simulations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the environmental interactions of quantum systems is a critical bottleneck in the development of robust quantum technologies. Traditional tomographic methods are often data-intensive and struggle with scalability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for performing Lindblad tomography using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). By embedding the Lindblad master equation directly into the neural network's loss function, our approach simultaneously learns the quantum state's evolution and infers the underlying dissipation parameters from sparse, time-series measurement data. Our results show that PINNs can reconstruct both the system dynamics and the functional form of unknown noise parameters, presenting a sample-efficient and scalable solution for quantum device characterization. Ultimately, our method produces a fully-differentiable digital twin of a noisy quantum system by learning its governing master equation.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Agents with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Autoregressive Variational Autoencoders for Nonlinear and Nonstationary Spatio-Temporal Blind Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modeling and prediction of multivariate spatio-temporal data involve numerous challenges. Dimension reduction methods can significantly simplify this process, provided that they account for the complex dependencies between variables and across time and space. Nonlinear blind source separation has emerged as a promising approach, particularly following recent advances in identifiability results. Building on these developments, we introduce the identifiable autoregressive variational autoencoder, which ensures the identifiability of latent components consisting of nonstationary autoregressive processes. The blind source separation efficacy of the proposed method is showcased through a simulation study, where it is compared against state-of-the-art methods, and the spatio-temporal prediction performance is evaluated against several competitors on air pollution and weather datasets.</description>

      <title>Query-Focused Extractive Summarization for Sentiment Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructive analysis of feedback from clients often requires determining the cause of their sentiment from a substantial amount of text documents. To assist and improve the productivity of such endeavors, we leverage the task of Query-Focused Summarization (QFS). Models of this task are often impeded by the linguistic dissonance between the query and the source documents. We propose and substantiate a multi-bias framework to help bridge this gap at a domain-agnostic, generic level; we then formulate specialized approaches for the problem of sentiment explanation through sentiment-based biases and query expansion. We achieve experimental results outperforming baseline models on a real-world proprietary sentiment-aware QFS dataset.</description>

      <title>Improving Out-of-Domain Audio Deepfake Detection via Layer Selection and Fusion of SSL-Based Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio deepfake detection systems based on frozen pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) encoders show a high level of performance when combined with layer-weighted pooling methods, such as multi-head factorized attentive pooling (MHFA). However, they still struggle to generalize to out-of-domain (OOD) conditions. We tackle this problem by studying the behavior of six different pre-trained SSLs, on four different test corpora. We perform a layer-by-layer analysis to determine which layers contribute most. Next, we study the pooling head, comparing a strategy based on a single layer with automatic selection via MHFA. We observed that selecting the best layer gave very good results, while reducing system parameters by up to 80%. A wide variation in performance as a function of test corpus and SSL model is also observed, showing that the pre-training strategy of the encoder plays a role. Finally, score-level fusion of several encoders improved generalization to OOD attacks.</description>

      <title>LEGO: Spatial Accelerator Generation and Optimization for Tensor Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern tensor applications, especially foundation models and generative AI applications require multiple input modalities (both vision and language), which increases the demand for flexible accelerator architecture. Existing frameworks suffer from the trade-off between design flexibility and productivity of RTL generation: either limited to very few hand-written templates or cannot automatically generate the RTL. To address this challenge, we propose the LEGO framework, which targets tensor applications and automatically generates spatial architecture design and outputs synthesizable RTL code without handwritten RTL design templates. Leveraging the affine-transformation-based architecture representation, LEGO front end finds interconnections between function units, synthesizes the memory system, and fuses different spatial dataflow designs based on data reuse analysis. LEGO back end then translates the hardware in a primitive-level graph to perform lower-level optimizations, and applies a set of linear-programming algorithms to optimally insert pipeline registers and reduce the overhead of unused logic when switching spatial dataflows. Our evaluation demonstrates that LEGO can achieve 3.2x speedup and 2.4x energy efficiency compared to previous work Gemmini, and can generate one architecture for diverse modern foundation models in generative AI applications.</description>

      <title>When marine radar target detection meets pretrained large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are widely used to extract high-dimensional patterns from the sequence features of radar echo signals. However, conventional DL algorithms face challenges such as redundant feature segments, and constraints from restricted model sizes. To address these issues, we propose a framework that integrates feature preprocessing with large language models (LLMs). Our preprocessing module tokenizes radar sequence features, applies a patch selection algorithm to filter out uninformative segments, and projects the selected patches into embeddings compatible with the feature space of pre-trained LLMs. Leveraging these refined embeddings, we incorporate a pre-trained LLM, fine-tuning only the normalization layers to reduce training burdens while enhancing performance. Experiments on measured datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on supervised learning tests.</description>

      <title>Learning Contact Dynamics for Control with Action-conditioned Face Interaction Graph Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a learnable physics simulator that provides accurate motion and force-torque prediction of robot end effectors in contact-rich manipulation. The proposed model extends the state-of-the-art GNN-based simulator (FIGNet) with novel node and edge types, enabling action-conditional predictions for control and state estimation tasks. In simulation, the MPC agent using our model matches the performance of the same controller with the ground truth dynamics model in a challenging peg-in-hole task, while in the real-world experiment, our model achieves a 50% improvement in motion prediction accuracy and 3$\times$ increase in force-torque prediction precision over the baseline physics simulator. Source code and data are publicly available.</description>

      <title>MMM: Clustering Multivariate Longitudinal Mixed-type Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate longitudinal data of mixed-type are increasingly collected in many science domains. However, algorithms to cluster this kind of data remain scarce, due to the challenge to simultaneously model the within- and between-time dependence structures for multivariate data of mixed kind. We introduce the Mixture of Mixed-Matrices (MMM) model: reorganizing the data in a three-way structure and assuming that the non-continuous variables are observations of underlying latent continuous variables, the model relies on a mixture of matrix-variate normal distributions to perform clustering in the latent dimension. The MMM model is thus able to handle continuous, ordinal, binary, nominal and count data and to concurrently model the heterogeneity, the association among the responses and the temporal dependence structure in a parsimonious way and without assuming conditional independence. The inference is carried out through an MCMC-EM algorithm, which is detailed. An evaluation of the model through synthetic data shows its inference abilities. A real-world application on financial data is presented.</description>

      <title>The Morgan-Pitman Test of Equality of Variances and its Application to Machine Learning Model Evaluation and Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model selection in non-linear models often prioritizes performance metrics over statistical tests, limiting the ability to account for sampling variability. We propose the use of a statistical test to assess the equality of variances in forecasting errors. The test builds upon the classic Morgan-Pitman approach, incorporating enhancements to ensure robustness against data with heavy-tailed distributions or outliers with high variance, plus a strategy to make residuals from machine learning models statistically independent. Through a series of simulations and real-world data applications, we demonstrate the test's effectiveness and practical utility, offering a reliable tool for model evaluation and selection in diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>HoloGarment: 360{\deg} Novel View Synthesis of In-the-Wild Garments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of in-the-wild garments is a challenging task due significant occlusions, complex human poses, and cloth deformations. Prior methods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and static objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this paper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3 images or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates 360{\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit training paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space. During inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic video-to-360{\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment "atlas" representation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world video. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all viewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that HoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild garments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles challenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and occlusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture details, and accurate geometry.

      <title>Extended UCB Policies for Multi-armed Bandit Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:1112.1768v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems are widely studied in fields of operations research, stochastic optimization, and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we consider the classical MAB model with heavy-tailed reward distributions and introduce the extended robust UCB policy, which is an extension of the results of Bubeck et al. [5] and Lattimore [22] that are further based on the pioneering idea of UCB policies [e.g. Auer et al. 3]. The previous UCB policies require some strict conditions on reward distributions, which can be difficult to guarantee in practical scenarios. Our extended robust UCB generalizes Lattimore's seminary work (for moments of orders $p=4$ and $q=2$) to arbitrarily chosen $p&gt;q&gt;1$ as long as the two moments have a known controlled relationship, while still achieving the optimal regret growth order $O(log T)$, thus providing a broadened application area of UCB policies for heavy-tailed reward distributions. Furthermore, we achieve a near-optimal regret order without any knowledge of the reward distributions as long as their $p$-th moments exist for some $p&gt;1$. Finally, we briefly present our earlier work on light-tailed reward distributions for a complete illustration of the amazing simplicity and power of UCB policies.</description>

      <title>Security of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment and has been increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, including autonomous driving. Despite its promise, RL is susceptible to attacks designed either to compromise policy learning or to induce erroneous decisions by trained agents. Although the literature on RL security has grown rapidly and several surveys exist, existing categorizations often fall short in guiding the selection of appropriate defenses for specific systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of 86 recent studies on RL security, addressing these limitations by systematically categorizing attacks and defenses according to defined threat models and single- versus multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we examine the relevance and applicability of state-of-the-art attacks and defense mechanisms within the context of autonomous driving, providing insights to inform the design of robust RL systems.</description>

      <title>Calibration in Deep Learning: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01222v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calibrating deep neural models plays an important role in building reliable, robust AI systems in safety-critical applications. Recent work has shown that modern neural networks that possess high predictive capability are poorly calibrated and produce unreliable model predictions. Though deep learning models achieve remarkable performance on various benchmarks, the study of model calibration and reliability is relatively under-explored. Ideal deep models should have not only high predictive performance but also be well calibrated. There have been some recent advances in calibrating deep models. In this survey, we review the state-of-the-art calibration methods and their principles for performing model calibration. First, we start with the definition of model calibration and explain the root causes of model miscalibration. Then we introduce the key metrics that can measure this aspect. It is followed by a summary of calibration methods that we roughly classify into four categories: post-hoc calibration, regularization methods, uncertainty estimation, and composition methods. We also cover recent advancements in calibrating large models, particularly large language models (LLMs). Finally, we discuss some open issues, challenges, and potential directions.</description>

      <title>Sampling-enabled scalable manifold learning unveils the discriminative cluster structure of high-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01100v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a pivotal branch of machine learning, manifold learning uncovers the intrinsic low-dimensional structure within complex nonlinear manifolds in high-dimensional space for visualization, classification, clustering, and gaining key insights. Although existing techniques have achieved remarkable successes, they suffer from extensive distortions of cluster structure, which hinders the understanding of underlying patterns. Scalability issues also limit their applicability for handling large-scale data. We hence propose a sampling-based Scalable manifold learning technique that enables Uniform and Discriminative Embedding, namely SUDE, for large-scale and high-dimensional data. It starts by seeking a set of landmarks to construct the low-dimensional skeleton of the entire data, and then incorporates the non-landmarks into the learned space based on the constrained locally linear embedding (CLLE). We empirically validated the effectiveness of SUDE on synthetic datasets and real-world benchmarks, and applied it to analyze single-cell data and detect anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. SUDE exhibits distinct advantage in scalability with respect to data size and embedding dimension, and has promising performance in cluster separation, integrity, and global structure preservation. The experiments also demonstrate notable robustness in embedding quality as the sampling rate decreases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training neural networks with first order optimisation methods is at the core of the empirical success of deep learning. The scale of initialisation is a crucial factor, as small initialisations are generally associated to a feature learning regime, for which gradient descent is implicitly biased towards simple solutions. This work provides a general and quantitative description of the early alignment phase, originally introduced by Maennel et al. (2018). For small initialisation and one hidden ReLU layer networks, the early stage of the training dynamics leads to an alignment of the neurons towards key directions. This alignment induces a sparse representation of the network, which is directly related to the implicit bias of gradient flow at convergence. This sparsity inducing alignment however comes at the expense of difficulties in minimising the training objective: we also provide a simple data example for which overparameterised networks fail to converge towards global minima and only converge to a spurious stationary point instead.</description>

      <title>SEVEN: Pruning Transformer Model by Reserving Sentinels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale Transformer models (TM) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various tasks. However, their considerable parameter size restricts their applicability, particularly on mobile devices. Due to the dynamic and intricate nature of gradients on TM compared to Convolutional Neural Networks, commonly used pruning methods tend to retain weights with larger gradient noise. This results in pruned models that are sensitive to sparsity and datasets, exhibiting suboptimal performance. Symbolic Descent (SD) is a general approach for training and fine-tuning TM. In this paper, we attempt to describe the noisy batch gradient sequences on TM through the cumulative process of SD. We utilize this design to dynamically assess the importance scores of weights.SEVEN is introduced by us, which particularly favors weights with consistently high sensitivity, i.e., weights with small gradient noise. These weights are tended to be preserved by SEVEN. Extensive experiments on various TM in natural language, question-answering, and image classification domains are conducted to validate the effectiveness of SEVEN. The results demonstrate significant improvements of SEVEN in multiple pruning scenarios and across different sparsity levels. Additionally, SEVEN exhibits robust performance under various fine-tuning strategies. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/xiaojinying/SEVEN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pruning before training enables the deployment of neural networks on smart devices. By retaining weights conducive to generalization, pruned networks can be accommodated on resource-constrained smart devices. It is commonly held that the distance on weight norms between the initialized and the fully-trained networks correlates with generalization performance. However, as we have uncovered, inconsistency between this metric and generalization during training processes, which poses an obstacle to determine the pruned structures on smart devices in advance. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the learning gap, emphasizing its accurate correlation with generalization. Experiments show that the learning gap, in the form of feature maps from the penultimate layer of networks, aligns with variations of generalization performance. We propose a novel learning framework, LNPT, which enables mature networks on the cloud to provide online guidance for network pruning and learning on smart devices with unlabeled data. Our results demonstrate the superiority of this approach over supervised training.</description>

      <title>TED: Accelerate Model Training by Internal Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated strong performance in recent years, but the high cost of training drives the need for efficient methods to compress dataset sizes. We propose TED pruning, a method that addresses the challenge of overfitting under high pruning ratios by quantifying the model's ability to improve performance on pruned data while fitting retained data, known as Internal Generalization (IG). TED uses an optimization objective based on Internal Generalization Distance (IGD), measuring changes in IG before and after pruning to align with true generalization performance and achieve implicit regularization. The IGD optimization objective was verified to allow the model to achieve the smallest upper bound on generalization error. The impact of small mask fluctuations on IG is studied through masks and Taylor approximation, and fast estimation of IGD is enabled. In analyzing continuous training dynamics, the prior effect of IGD is validated, and a progressive pruning strategy is proposed. Experiments on image classification, natural language understanding, and large language model fine-tuning show TED achieves lossless performance with 60-70\% of the data. Upon acceptance, our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Can We Treat Noisy Labels as Accurate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noisy labels significantly hinder the accuracy and generalization of machine learning models, particularly when resulting from ambiguous instance features that complicate correct labeling. Traditional approaches, such as those relying on transition matrices for label correction, often struggle to effectively resolve such ambiguity, due to their inability to capture complex relationships between instances and noisy labels. In this paper, we propose EchoAlign, a paradigm shift in learning from noisy labels. Unlike previous methods that attempt to correct labels, EchoAlign treats noisy labels ($\tilde{Y}$) as accurate and modifies corresponding instances ($X$) to better align with these labels. The EchoAlign framework comprises two main components: (1) EchoMod leverages controllable generative models to selectively modify instance features, achieving alignment with noisy labels while preserving intrinsic instance characteristics such as shape, texture, and semantic identity. (2) EchoSelect mitigates distribution shifts introduced by instance modifications by strategically retaining a substantial subset of original instances with correct labels. Specifically, EchoSelect exploits feature similarity distributions between original and modified instances to accurately distinguish between correctly and incorrectly labeled samples. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that EchoAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-noise environments, achieving superior accuracy and robustness. Notably, under 30% instance-dependent noise, EchoSelect retains nearly twice the number of correctly labeled samples compared to previous methods, maintaining 99% selection accuracy, thereby clearly illustrating the effectiveness of EchoAlign. The implementation of EchoAlign is publicly available at https://github.com/KevinCarpricorn/EchoAlign/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Continuum Attention for Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces. In this paper, we state and prove the first universal approximation result for transformer neural operators, using only a slight modification of the architecture implemented in practice. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.</description>

      <title>FairCoT: Enhancing Fairness in Text-to-Image Generation via Chain of Thought Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text to image models through Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems including DALLE and various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI driven content generation.</description>

      <title>Kolb-Based Experiential Learning for Generalist Agents with Human-Level Kaggle Data Science Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human expertise emerges through iterative cycles of interaction, reflection, and internal model updating, which are central to cognitive theories such as Kolb's experiential learning and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In contrast, current AI systems, particularly LLM agents, rely on static pre-training or rigid workflows, lacking mechanisms for continual adaptation. Recent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection, revision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like experiential learning. Thus the key question: Can we design LLM agents capable of structured, cognitively grounded learning similar to human processes? In response, we propose a computational framework of Kolb's learning cycle with Vygotsky's ZPD for autonomous agents. Our architecture separates extrinsic (environment interaction) and intrinsic (internal reflection/abstraction) functions, enabling cognitively grounded scaffolded learning, where the agent initially learns within structured environments, followed by open-ended generalisation. This approach empowers agents to master complex tasks ; domains that traditional fine-tuning or simple reflective methods could not tackle effectively. Its potential is powerfully demonstrated via direct comparison with humans in real-world Kaggle data science competitions. Learning fully automated data science code generation across 81 tasks, our system, Agent K, demonstrated the ability to perform the entire workflow autonomously, achieving an Elo-MMR score of 1694, beyond median score of the Kaggle Masters (the top 2% among 200,000 users) of our study. With 9 gold, 8 silver, and 12 bronze medals level performance - including 4 gold and 4 silver on prize-awarding competitions - Agent K is the 1st AI system to successfully integrate Kolb- and Vygotsky-inspired human cognitive learning, marking a major step toward generalist AI.</description>

      <title>Timing Matters: Enhancing User Experience through Temporal Prediction in Smart Homes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices generates vast interaction data, offering insights into user behaviour. While prior work predicts what actions users perform, the timing of these actions -- critical for enabling proactive and efficient smart systems -- remains relatively underexplored. Addressing this gap, we focus on predicting the time of the next user action in smart environments. Due to the lack of public datasets with fine-grained timestamps suitable for this task and associated privacy concerns, we contribute a dataset of 11.6k sequences synthesized based on human annotations of interaction patterns, pairing actions with precise timestamps. To this end, we introduce Timing-Matters, a Transformer-Encoder based method that predicts action timing, achieving 38.30% accuracy on the synthesized dataset, outperforming the best baseline by 6%, and showing 1--6% improvements on other open datasets. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>TinySubNets: An efficient and low capacity continual learning strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a highly relevant setting gaining traction in recent machine learning research. Among CL works, architectural and hybrid strategies are particularly effective due to their potential to adapt the model architecture as new tasks are presented. However, many existing solutions do not efficiently exploit model sparsity, and are prone to capacity saturation due to their inefficient use of available weights, which limits the number of learnable tasks. In this paper, we propose TinySubNets (TSN), a novel architectural CL strategy that addresses the issues through the unique combination of pruning with different sparsity levels, adaptive quantization, and weight sharing. Pruning identifies a subset of weights that preserve model performance, making less relevant weights available for future tasks. Adaptive quantization allows a single weight to be separated into multiple parts which can be assigned to different tasks. Weight sharing between tasks boosts the exploitation of capacity and task similarity, allowing for the identification of a better trade-off between model accuracy and capacity. These features allow TSN to efficiently leverage the available capacity, enhance knowledge transfer, and reduce computational resource consumption. Experimental results involving common benchmark CL datasets and scenarios show that our proposed strategy achieves better results in terms of accuracy than existing state-of-the-art CL strategies. Moreover, our strategy is shown to provide a significantly improved model capacity exploitation. Code released at: https://github.com/lifelonglab/tinysubnets.</description>

      <title>Robustness in the Face of Partial Identifiability in Reward Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Reward Learning (ReL), we are given feedback on an unknown target reward, and the goal is to use this information to recover it in order to carry out some downstream application, e.g., planning. When the feedback is not informative enough, the target reward is only partially identifiable, i.e., there exists a set of rewards, called the feasible set, that are equally plausible candidates for the target reward. In these cases, the ReL algorithm might recover a reward function different from the target reward, possibly leading to a failure in the application. In this paper, we introduce a general ReL framework that permits to quantify the drop in "performance" suffered in the considered application because of identifiability issues. Building on this, we propose a robust approach to address the identifiability problem in a principled way, by maximizing the "performance" with respect to the worst-case reward in the feasible set. We then develop Rob-ReL, a ReL algorithm that applies this robust approach to the subset of ReL problems aimed at assessing a preference between two policies, and we provide theoretical guarantees on sample and iteration complexity for Rob-ReL. We conclude with a proof-of-concept experiment to illustrate the considered setting.</description>

      <title>SafeSwitch: Steering Unsafe LLM Behavior via Internal Activation Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01042v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities across various tasks but also pose risks by generating harmful content. Existing safety mechanisms, while improving model safety, often lead to overly cautious behavior and fail to fully leverage LLMs' internal cognitive processes. Inspired by humans' reflective thinking capability, we first show that LLMs can similarly perform internal assessments about safety in their internal states. Building on this insight, we propose SafeSwitch, a dynamic framework that regulates unsafe outputs by utilizing the prober-based internal state monitor that actively detects harmful intentions, and activates a safety head that leads to safer and more conservative responses only when necessary. SafeSwitch reduces harmful outputs by approximately 80% on harmful queries while maintaining strong utility, reaching a Pareto optimal among several methods. Our method is also advantageous over traditional methods in offering more informative, context-aware refusals, and achieves these benefits while only tuning less than 6% of the original parameters. SafeSwitch demonstrates large language models' capacity for self-awareness and reflection regarding safety, offering a promising approach to more nuanced and effective safety controls. Codes for this work are available at https://github.com/Hanpx20/SafeSwitch.</description>

      <title>One Goal, Many Challenges: Robust Preference Optimization Amid Content-Aware and Multi-Source Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in generating human-like responses, largely due to preference alignment techniques. However, these methods often assume unbiased human feedback, which is rarely the case in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces Content-Aware Noise-Resilient Preference Optimization (CNRPO), a novel framework that addresses multiple sources of content-dependent noise in preference learning. CNRPO employs a multi-objective optimization approach to separate true preferences from content-aware noises, effectively mitigating their impact. We leverage backdoor attack mechanisms to efficiently learn and control various noise sources within a single model. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on different synthetic noisy datasets demonstrate that CNRPO significantly improves alignment with primary human preferences while controlling for secondary noises and biases, such as response length and harmfulness.</description>

      <title>MODIS: Multi-Omics Data Integration for Small and unpaired datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important objective in computational biology is the efficient integration of multi-omics data. The task of integration comes with challenges: multi-omics data are most often unpaired (requiring diagonal integration), partially labeled with information about biological conditions, and in some situations such as rare diseases, only very small datasets are available. We present MODIS, a semi supervised framework designed to account for these particular challenges. To address the challenge of very small datasets, we propose to exploit information contained in larger multi-omics databases by training our model on a large reference database and a small target dataset simultaneously, effectively turning the problem of transfer learning into a problem of learning with class imbalance. MODIS performs diagonal integration on unpaired samples, leveraging class-labels to align modalities despite class imbalance and data scarcity. The architecture combines multiple variational auto-encoders, a class classifier and an adversarially trained modality classifier. To ensure training stability, we adapted a regularized relativistic GAN loss to this setting. We first validate MODIS on a synthetic dataset to assess the level of supervision needed for accurate alignment and to quantify the impact of class imbalance on predictive performance. We then apply our approach to the large public TCGA database, considering between 10 and 34 classes (cancer types and normal tissue). MODIS demonstrates high prediction accuracy, robust performance with limited supervision, and stability to class imbalance. These results position MODIS as a promising solution for challenging integration scenarios, particularly diagonal integration with a small number of samples, typical of rare diseases studies.

      <title>Lean Formalization of Generalization Error Bound by Rademacher Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formalize the generalization error bound using the Rademacher complexity for the Lean 4 theorem prover based on the probability theory in the Mathlib 4 library. Generalization error quantifies the gap between a learning machine's performance on given training data versus unseen test data, and the Rademacher complexity is a powerful tool to upper-bound the generalization error of a variety of modern learning problems. Previous studies have only formalized extremely simple cases such as bounds by parameter counts and analyses for very simple models (decision stumps). Formalizing the Rademacher complexity bound, also known as the uniform law of large numbers, requires substantial development and is achieved for the first time in this study. In the course of development, we formalize the Rademacher complexity and its unique arguments such as symmetrization, and clarify the topological assumptions on hypothesis classes under which the bound holds. As an application, we also present the formalization of generalization error bound for $L^2$-regularization models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthonormalized updates accelerate training, improve stability, and enable robust hyperparameter transfer, but existing methods like Muon rely on dense matrix operations that clash with sharded weights in large-scale LLM training, causing high compute and communication cost. We introduce Dion (Distributed Orthonormalization), a scalable and efficient update rule that replaces Newton-Schulz iteration with amortized power iteration on a momentum buffer, avoiding full-matrix reconstruction and integrating cleanly with weight sharding. The rank-fraction parameter with error feedback enables low-rank updates that balance quality with significant cost savings. On language models from 160M to 3B parameters, Dion retains the benefits of orthonormalized updates, while markedly reducing wall-clock time at scale, making it a practical optimizer for next-generation foundation models.

      <title>Predicting Stock Prices using Permutation Decision Trees and Strategic Trailing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT) and strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing profitable trades in the Indian stock market. We focus on high-frequency data using 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index and Forex pairs such as XAUUSD and EURUSD. We implement a trading strategy that aims to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices, capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations. Due to regulatory constraints in India, short selling is not considered in our strategy. The model incorporates various technical indicators and employs hyperparameters such as the trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds to manage risk effectively. We trained and tested data on a 3 month dataset provided by Yahoo Finance. Our bot based on Permutation Decision Tree achieved a profit of 1.1802\% over the testing period, where as a bot based on LSTM gave a return of 0.557\% over the testing period and a bot based on RNN gave a return of 0.5896\% over the testing period. All of the bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss of 2.29\%.</description>

      <title>Safety Pretraining: Toward the Next Generation of Safe AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, the risk of generating harmful or toxic content remains a central challenge. Post-hoc alignment methods are brittle: once unsafe patterns are learned during pretraining, they are hard to remove. In this work, we present a data-centric pretraining framework that builds safety into the model from the start. Our framework consists of four key steps: (i) Safety Filtering: building a safety classifier to classify webdata into safe and unsafe categories; (ii) Safety Rephrasing: we recontextualize unsafe webdata into safer narratives; (iii) Native Refusal: we develop RefuseWeb and Moral Education pretraining datasets that actively teach model to refuse on unsafe content and the moral reasoning behind it, and (iv) Harmfulness-Tag annotated pretraining: we flag unsafe content during pretraining using a special token, and use it to steer model away from unsafe generations at inference. Our safety-pretrained models reduce attack success rates from 38.8\% to 8.4\% on standard LLM safety benchmarks with no performance degradation on general tasks.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Asynchronous Federated Learning with Gradient Compression for Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical federated learning (FL), the large communication overhead between clients and the server is often a significant bottleneck. Gradient compression methods can effectively reduce this overhead, while error feedback (EF) restores model accuracy. Moreover, due to device heterogeneity, synchronous FL often suffers from stragglers and inefficiency-issues that asynchronous FL effectively alleviates. However, in asynchronous FL settings-which inherently face three major challenges: asynchronous delay, data heterogeneity, and flexible client participation-the complex interactions among these system/statistical constraints and compression/EF mechanisms remain poorly understood theoretically. In this paper, we fill this gap through a comprehensive convergence study that adequately decouples and unravels these complex interactions across various FL frameworks. We first consider a basic asynchronous FL framework AsynFL, and establish an improved convergence analysis that relies on fewer assumptions and yields a superior convergence rate than prior studies. We then extend our study to a compressed version, AsynFLC, and derive sufficient conditions for its convergence, indicating the nonlinear interaction between asynchronous delay and compression rate. Our analysis further demonstrates how asynchronous delay and data heterogeneity jointly exacerbate compression-induced errors, thereby hindering convergence. Furthermore, we study the convergence of AsynFLC-EF, the framework that further integrates EF. We prove that EF can effectively reduce the variance of gradient estimation under the aforementioned challenges, enabling AsynFLC-EF to match the convergence rate of AsynFL. We also show that the impact of asynchronous delay and flexible participation on EF is limited to slowing down the higher-order convergence term. Experimental results substantiate our analytical findings very well.</description>

      <title>Anant-Net: Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality with Scalable and Interpretable Neural Surrogate for High-Dimensional PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) arise in diverse scientific and engineering applications but remain computationally intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. Traditional numerical methods struggle with the exponential growth in computational complexity, particularly on hypercubic domains, where the number of required collocation points increases rapidly with dimensionality. Here, we introduce Anant-Net, an efficient neural surrogate that overcomes this challenge, enabling the solution of PDEs in high dimensions. Unlike hyperspheres, where the internal volume diminishes as dimensionality increases, hypercubes retain or expand their volume (for unit or larger length), making high-dimensional computations significantly more demanding. Anant-Net efficiently incorporates high-dimensional boundary conditions and minimizes the PDE residual at high-dimensional collocation points. To enhance interpretability, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold networks into the Anant-Net architecture. We benchmark Anant-Net's performance on several linear and nonlinear high-dimensional equations, including the Poisson, Sine-Gordon, and Allen-Cahn equations, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness across randomly sampled test points from high-dimensional space. Importantly, Anant-Net achieves these results with remarkable efficiency, solving 300-dimensional problems on a single GPU within a few hours. We also compare Anant-Net's results for accuracy and runtime with other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings establish Anant-Net as an accurate, interpretable, and scalable framework for efficiently solving high-dimensional PDEs.</description>

      <title>Fast Fourier Transform-Based Spectral and Temporal Gradient Filtering for Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a key framework for protecting sensitive data in machine learning, but standard DP-SGD often suffers from significant accuracy loss due to injected noise. To address this limitation, we introduce the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that improves gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. FFTKF applies frequency-domain filtering to shift privacy noise into less informative high-frequency components, preserving the low-frequency gradient signals that carry most learning information. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with a finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. The method has per-iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ and achieves higher test accuracy than DP-SGD and DiSK on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that FFTKF ensures equivalent privacy while delivering a stronger privacy--utility trade-off through reduced variance and controlled bias.</description>

      <title>Potential failures of physics-informed machine learning in traffic flow modeling: theoretical and experimental analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates why physics-informed machine learning (PIML) can fail in macroscopic traffic flow modeling. We define failure as cases where a PIML model underperforms both purely data-driven and purely physics-based baselines by a given threshold. Unlike in other fields, physics residuals themselves do not hinder optimization in this setting. Instead, effective updates require both data and physics gradients to form acute angles with the true gradient, a condition difficult to satisfy with low-resolution loop data. In such cases, neural networks cannot accurately approximate density and speed, and the constructed physics residuals, already degraded by discrete sampling and temporal averaging, lose their ability to capture PDE dynamics, which directly leads to PIML failure. Theoretically, although LWR and ARZ solutions are weak solutions, for piecewise $C^k$ initial data they remain $C^k$ off the shock set under mild conditions, which has Lebesgue measure zero. Thus, almost all detector or collocation points lie in smooth regions where residuals are valid, and the MLP's inability to exactly represent discontinuities is immaterial. Finally, we establish MSE lower bounds of physics residuals: higher-order models such as ARZ have strictly larger consistency error bounds than LWR under mild conditions. This explains why LWR-based PIML can outperform ARZ-based PIML even with high-resolution data, with the gap shrinking as resolution increases, consistent with prior empirical findings.</description>

      <title>STRICT: Stress Test of Rendering Images Containing Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with their ability to synthesize realistic and diverse scenes, they continue to struggle to generate consistent and legible text within images. This shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal generative modeling. We release our entire evaluation pipeline at https://github.com/tianyu-z/STRICT-Bench.</description>

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse graph-related tasks, their high-dimensional hidden representations render them black boxes. In this work, we propose Graph Lingual Network (GLN), a GNN built on large language models (LLMs), with hidden representations in the form of human-readable text. Through careful prompt design, GLN incorporates not only the message passing module of GNNs but also advanced GNN techniques, including graph attention and initial residual connection. The comprehensibility of GLN's hidden representations enables an intuitive analysis of how node representations change (1) across layers and (2) under advanced GNN techniques, shedding light on the inner workings of GNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GLN achieves strong zero-shot performance on node classification and link prediction, outperforming existing LLM-based baseline methods.</description>

      <title>A Convolution and Attention Based Encoder for Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) remain a core challenge in reinforcement learning due to incomplete state information. We address this by reformulating POMDPs as fully observable processes with fixed-length observation histories as augmented states. To efficiently encode these histories, we propose a lightweight temporal encoder based on depthwise separable convolution and self-attention, avoiding the overhead of recurrent and Transformer-based models. Integrated into an actor-critic framework, our method achieves superior performance on continuous control benchmarks under partial observability. More broadly, this work shows that lightweight temporal encoding can improve the scalability of AI systems under uncertainty. It advances the development of agents capable of reasoning robustly in real-world environments where information is incomplete or delayed.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Scientific Simulation Surrogates via Adaptive Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective surrogate models are critical for accelerating scientific simulations. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer a compact and continuous framework for modeling spatially structured data, but they often struggle with complex scientific fields exhibiting localized, high-frequency variations. Recent approaches address this by introducing additional features along rigid geometric structures (e.g., grids), but at the cost of flexibility and increased model size. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective alternative: Feature-Adaptive INR (FA-INR). FA-INR leverages cross-attention to an augmented memory bank to learn flexible feature representations, enabling adaptive allocation of model capacity based on data characteristics, rather than rigid structural assumptions. To further improve scalability, we introduce a coordinate-guided mixture of experts (MoE) that enhances the specialization and efficiency of feature representations. Experiments on three large-scale ensemble simulation datasets show that FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art fidelity while significantly reducing model size, establishing a new trade-off frontier between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page: http://s-sahoo.github.io/duo</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware and Highly Generalizable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Retrieval in Multi-Deep Storage Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA) method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.</description>

      <title>Low-rank variational dropout: Uncertainty and rank selection in adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA adapt large language models by inserting low-rank adapters, but they leave open two key questions: how to give the adapted model calibrated uncertainty, and how to choose the adapter rank. Existing approaches to uncertainty are typically post-hoc, while rank selection is manual and task-specific. BayesLoRA revisits variational dropout in the LoRA setting and shows that the natural unit of stochasticity is not individual weights but entire ranks of the adapter. By placing rank-wise variational distributions over adapter components, BayesLoRA defines a posterior that (i) yields calibrated predictions through adapter-only Monte Carlo sampling and (ii) prunes redundant ranks automatically via an ARD-style KL term. Theoretical analysis shows that this rank-parameterized posterior localizes uncertainty to the adapted subspace and explains amplification under distribution shift. Empirically, BayesLoRA improves calibration while at the same time producing lighter, faster adapters, removing the need to tune ranks by hand. This dual role of uncertainty estimation and uncertainty-driven pruning suggests BayesLoRA may offer a practical default for reliable and efficient PEFT.</description>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. While existing approaches for aggregating client-specific classification heads and adapted backbone parameters require architectural modifications or loss function changes, our method uniquely leverages intrinsic training signals already available during standard optimization. We present LIVAR (Layer Importance and VARiance-based merging), which introduces: i) a variance-weighted classifier aggregation scheme using naturally emergent feature statistics, and ii) an explainability-driven LoRA merging technique based on SHAP analysis of existing update parameter patterns. Without any architectural overhead, LIVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining seamless integration with existing FL methods. This work demonstrates that effective model merging can be achieved solely through existing training signals, establishing a new paradigm for efficient federated model aggregation.

      <title>Greedy Low-Rank Gradient Compression for Distributed Learning with Convergence Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees. GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Interpretability of LoRA-Adapted Language Models for Nuclear Reactor Safety Applications</title>

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains, such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM (Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR 50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear operations.</description>

      <title>Task-Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall: Making Neural Networks Learn like College Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as catastrophic forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice, and Spaced Repetition, named Task-Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay framework with a mechanism we term the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and the Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to Standard Experience Replay's 7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.</description>

      <title>Solved in Unit Domain: JacobiNet for Differentiable Coordinate-Transformed PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks offer a powerful framework for solving PDEs by embedding physical laws into the learning process. However, when applied to domains with irregular boundaries, PINNs often suffer from instability and slow convergence, which stems from (1) inconsistent normalization due to geometric anisotropy, (2) inaccurate boundary enforcements, and (3) imbalanced loss term competition. A common workaround is to map the domain to a regular space. Yet, conventional mapping methods rely on case-specific meshes, define Jacobians at pre-specified fixed nodes, reformulate PDEs via the chain rule-making them incompatible with modern automatic differentiation, tensor-based frameworks. To bridge this gap, we propose JacobiNet, a learning-based coordinate-transformed PINN framework that unifies domain mapping and PDE solving within an end-to-end differentiable architecture. Leveraging lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet learns continuous, differentiable mappings, enables direct Jacobian computation via autograd, shares computation graph with downstream PINNs. Its continuous nature and built-in Jacobian eliminate the need for meshing, explicit Jacobians computation/ storage, and PDE reformulation, while unlocking geometric-editing operations, reducing the mapping cost. Separating physical modeling from geometric complexity, JacobiNet (1) addresses normalization challenges in the original anisotropic coordinates, (2) facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions, and (3) mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. Evaluated on various PDEs, JacobiNet reduces the L2 error from 0.11-0.73 to 0.01-0.09. In vessel-like domains with varying shapes, JacobiNet enables millisecond-level mapping inference for unseen geometries, improves prediction accuracy by an average of 3.65*, while delivering over 10* speed up-demonstrating strong generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Rate of Penetration (ROP) is pivotal for drilling optimization, yet it remains a persistent challenge due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature of drilling data. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning architecture in which input data are first processed through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling operational cycles, and the resulting features are subsequently refined by an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization. Concurrently, the same input is directed to a Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block that enables efficient cross-feature modeling of static and categorical attributes such as lithology indices and mud properties. The outputs from the enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer are concatenated, after which an adaptive attention selectively emphasizes the most informative feature representations for accurate ROP prediction. The proposed framework fuses sequential memory, static feature interactions, global contextual learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution to the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Evaluation on a real-world drilling dataset demonstrates benchmark-leading performance, achieving an Rsqaure of 0.9988 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly surpassing standalone and hybrid baselines. Model interpretability is achieved through SHAP and LIME, and comparisons between actual and predicted curves, along with bias checks, confirm the accuracy and fairness of the model across various scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables dependable real-time ROP prediction, supporting the development of intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational benefits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities, architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer practical recommendations.</description>

      <title>CRoC: Context Refactoring Contrast for Graph Anomaly Detection with Limited Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.</description>

      <title>RISE: Enhancing VLM Image Annotation with Self-Supervised Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.Code and resources are available at: https://github.com/HSH55/RISE.</description>

Abstract: The deployment of Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) on resource-constrained devices, such as microcontrollers, has introduced significant challenges in balancing model performance, computational complexity, and memory constraints. Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) addresses these issues by integrating advancements across machine learning algorithms, hardware acceleration, and software optimization to efficiently run deep neural networks on embedded systems. This survey presents a hardware-centric introduction to quantization, systematically reviewing essential quantization techniques employed to accelerate deep learning models for embedded applications. In particular, further emphasis is placed on the critical trade-offs between model performance and hardware capabilities. The survey further evaluates existing software frameworks and hardware platforms designed specifically for supporting QNN execution on microcontrollers. Moreover, we provide an analysis of the current challenges and an outline of promising future directions in the rapidly evolving domain of QNN deployment.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Superposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial examples -- inputs with imperceptible perturbations that fool neural networks -- remain one of deep learning's most perplexing phenomena despite nearly a decade of research. While numerous defenses and explanations have been proposed, there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism. One underexplored hypothesis is that superposition, a concept from mechanistic interpretability, may be a major contributing factor, or even the primary cause. We present four lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis, greatly extending prior arguments by Elhage et al. (2022): (1) superposition can theoretically explain a range of adversarial phenomena, (2) in toy models, intervening on superposition controls robustness, (3) in toy models, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition, and (4) in ResNet18, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17850v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction. Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>Developing a Multi-Modal Machine Learning Model For Predicting Performance of Automotive Hood Frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase. The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural development and accelerate the design cycle.</description>

      <title>Principled Approximation Methods for Efficient and Scalable Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations, leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization, revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's performance.</description>

      <title>MEPT: Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning as a Manifold Mapper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process: pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is avaliable at https://runjia.tech/emnlp_mept/.</description>

      <title>Binary Quantization For LLMs Through Dynamic Grouping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in {-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However, such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007 bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original 7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90. Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

Abstract: We provide our perspective on X-Learning (XL), a novel distributed learning architecture that generalizes and extends the concept of decentralization. Our goal is to present a vision for XL, introducing its unexplored design considerations and degrees of freedom. To this end, we shed light on the intuitive yet non-trivial connections between XL, graph theory, and Markov chains. We also present a series of open research directions to stimulate further research.</description>

      <title>IPR: Intelligent Prompt Routing with User-Controlled Quality-Cost Trade-offs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the strongest model in the Claude family and processes requests with sub-150ms latency.</description>

      <title>QualityFM: a Multimodal Physiological Signal Foundation Model with Self-Distillation for Signal Quality Challenges in Critically Ill Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality, leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function, which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks: false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and ECG signals.</description>

      <title>K2-Think: A Parameter-Efficient Reasoning System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K2-Think is a reasoning system that achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 32B parameter model, matching or surpassing much larger models like GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek v3.1. Built on the Qwen2.5 base model, our system shows that smaller models can compete at the highest levels by combining advanced post-training and test-time computation techniques. The approach is based on six key technical pillars: Long Chain-of-thought Supervised Finetuning, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), Agentic planning prior to reasoning, Test-time Scaling, Speculative Decoding, and Inference-optimized Hardware, all using publicly available open-source datasets. K2-Think excels in mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art scores on public benchmarks for open-source models, while also performing strongly in other areas such as Code and Science. Our results confirm that a more parameter-efficient model like K2-Think 32B can compete with state-of-the-art systems through an integrated post-training recipe that includes long chain-of-thought training and strategic inference-time enhancements, making open-source reasoning systems more accessible and affordable. K2-Think is freely available at k2think.ai, offering best-in-class inference speeds of over 2,000 tokens per second per request via the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of In-Ear Single-Channel ExG for Wearable Sleep Monitoring in Real-World Settings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g. automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11 participants (mean age: 24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse) as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep) using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Domain Mixed Unit (DMU) is a new neural arithmetic unit that learns a single parameter gate that mixes between log-space and linear-space representations while performing either addition (DMU add) or subtraction (DMU sub). Two initializations are proposed for the DMU: one covering addition and multiplication, and another covering subtraction and division. The DMU achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NALM Benchmark, a dataset designed to test the ability of neural arithmetic units to generalize arithmetic operations, specifically performing with the highest percentage solved over all seeds on multiplication and division. The DMU will be submitted as a pull request to the open-source NALM benchmark, and its code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/marict/nalm-benchmark</description>

      <title>Two Sides of the Same Optimization Coin: Model Degradation and Representation Collapse in Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale. Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>STRIDE: Subset-Free Functional Decomposition for XAI in Tabular Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks are limited in their expressiveness, summarizing complex feature effects as single scalar values \phi_i. This approach answers "what" features are important but fails to reveal "how" they interact. Furthermore, methods that attempt to capture interactions, like those based on Shapley values, often face an exponential computational cost. We present STRIDE, a scalable framework that addresses both limitations by reframing explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal "functional decomposition" in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). In the tabular setups we study, STRIDE analytically computes functional components f_S(x_S) via a recursive kernel-centering procedure. The approach is model-agnostic and theoretically grounded with results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence. In tabular benchmarks (10 datasets, median over 10 seeds), STRIDE attains a 3.0 times median speedup over TreeSHAP and a mean R^2=0.93 for reconstruction. We also introduce "component surgery", a diagnostic that isolates a learned interaction and quantifies its contribution; on California Housing, removing a single interaction reduces test R^2 from 0.019 to 0.027.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA) Using CancelOut Layer and a Projected Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA), which identifies the underlying intrinsic dimension of a wide range of datasets whose samples lie on either linear or nonlinear manifolds. Beyond estimating the intrinsic dimension, IDEA is also able to reconstruct the original dataset after projecting it onto the corresponding latent space, which is structured using re-weighted double CancelOut layers. Our key contribution is the introduction of the projected reconstruction loss term, guiding the training of the model by continuously assessing the reconstruction quality under the removal of an additional latent dimension. We first assess the performance of IDEA on a series of theoretical benchmarks to validate its robustness. These experiments allow us to test its reconstruction ability and compare its performance with state-of-the-art intrinsic dimension estimators. The benchmarks show good accuracy and high versatility of our approach. Subsequently, we apply our model to data generated from the numerical solution of a vertically resolved one-dimensional free-surface flow, following a pointwise discretization of the vertical velocity profile in the horizontal direction, vertical direction, and time. IDEA succeeds in estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension and then reconstructs the original solution by working directly within the projection space identified by the network.</description>

Abstract: The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (&gt;95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.</description>

      <title>Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75\% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88\% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.</description>

      <title>Multipole Semantic Attention: A Fast Approximation of Softmax Attention for Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Multipole Semantic Attention (MuSe), an efficient approximation of softmax attention that combines semantic clustering with multipole expansions from computational physics. Our method addresses the quadratic computational complexity of transformers in the context length by clustering queries and keys separately in their learned representation spaces, enabling a hierarchical two-stage attention mechanism. Unlike prior clustering approaches that group only keys or use unified clustering, we maintain separate clusterings that respect attention's asymmetric treatment of these spaces. We augment centroid-based (monopole) approximations with dipole corrections that capture directional variance within clusters, preserving richer information during training. The method operates as a drop-in replacement for standard attention, requiring only hyperparameter specification without architectural modifications. Our approach achieves $\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ complexity for acausal attention with $C$ clusters and $\mathcal{O}(NCD \log N)$ for causal attention. On isolated attention layers, we demonstrate $3\times$ speedup over CUDNN Flash Attention at 8k context length, with relative squared errors below 20%. For causal attention, we develop a hierarchical block decomposition that combines exact local computation with efficient long-range approximation. In end-to-end pretraining of a 30M parameter model on book-length texts with 16k context, we achieve 12.2% runtime reduction with only 0.36% loss degradation, establishing the viability of multipole approximations for efficient transformer pretraining.</description>

      <title>Eigen-convergence of Gaussian kernelized graph Laplacian by manifold heat interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.09875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the spectral convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace-Beltrami operator when the graph affinity matrix is constructed from $N$ random samples on a $d$-dimensional manifold embedded in a possibly high dimensional space. By analyzing Dirichlet form convergence and constructing candidate approximate eigenfunctions via convolution with manifold heat kernel, we prove that, with Gaussian kernel, one can set the kernel bandwidth parameter $\epsilon \sim (\log N/ N)^{1/(d/2+2)}$ such that the eigenvalue convergence rate is $N^{-1/(d/2+2)}$ and the eigenvector convergence in 2-norm has rate $N^{-1/(d+4)}$; When $\epsilon \sim (\log N/N)^{1/(d/2+3)}$, both eigenvalue and eigenvector rates are $N^{-1/(d/2+3)}$. These rates are up to a $\log N$ factor and proved for finitely many low-lying eigenvalues. The result holds for un-normalized and random-walk graph Laplacians when data are uniformly sampled on the manifold, as well as the density-corrected graph Laplacian (where the affinity matrix is normalized by the degree matrix from both sides) with non-uniformly sampled data. As an intermediate result, we prove new point-wise and Dirichlet form convergence rates for the density-corrected graph Laplacian. Numerical results are provided to verify the theory.</description>

Abstract: Clustering in directed graphs remains a fundamental challenge due to the asymmetry in edge connectivity, which limits the applicability of classical spectral methods originally designed for undirected graphs. A common workaround is to symmetrize the adjacency matrix, but this often leads to losing critical directional information. In this work, we introduce the generalized Dirichlet energy (GDE), a novel energy functional that extends the classical Dirichlet energy to handle arbitrary positive vertex measures and Markov transition matrices. GDE provides a unified framework applicable to both directed and undirected graphs, and is closely tied to the diffusion dynamics of random walks. Building on this framework, we propose the generalized spectral clustering (GSC) method that enables the principled clustering of weakly connected digraphs without resorting to the introduction of teleportation to the random walk transition matrix. A key component of our approach is the utilization of a parametrized vertex measure encoding graph directionality and density. Experiments on real-world point-cloud datasets demonstrate that GSC consistently outperforms existing spectral clustering approaches in terms of clustering accuracy and robustness, offering a powerful new tool for graph-based data analysis.</description>

      <title>A Permutation-free Kernel Two-Sample Test</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy~(MMD) is a popular multivariate distance metric between distributions that has found utility in two-sample testing. The usual kernel-MMD test statistic is a degenerate U-statistic under the null, and thus it has an intractable limiting distribution. Hence, to design a level-$\alpha$ test, one usually selects the rejection threshold as the $(1-\alpha)$-quantile of the permutation distribution. The resulting nonparametric test has finite-sample validity but suffers from large computational cost, since every permutation takes quadratic time. We propose the cross-MMD, a new quadratic-time MMD test statistic based on sample-splitting and studentization. We prove that under mild assumptions, the cross-MMD has a limiting standard Gaussian distribution under the null. Importantly, we also show that the resulting test is consistent against any fixed alternative, and when using the Gaussian kernel, it has minimax rate-optimal power against local alternatives. For large sample sizes, our new cross-MMD provides a significant speedup over the MMD, for only a slight loss in power.</description>

      <title>Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes for Bayesian Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Inference on modern Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) often relies on a variational inference treatment, imposing violated assumptions of independence and the form of the posterior. Traditional MCMC approaches avoid these assumptions at the cost of increased computation due to its incompatibility to subsampling of the likelihood. New Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP) samplers permit subsampling, though introduce a model specific inhomogenous Poisson Process (IPPs) which is difficult to sample from. This work introduces a new generic and adaptive thinning scheme for sampling from these IPPs, and demonstrates how this approach can accelerate the application of PDMPs for inference in BNNs. Experimentation illustrates how inference with these methods is computationally feasible, can improve predictive accuracy, MCMC mixing performance, and provide informative uncertainty measurements when compared against other approximate inference schemes.</description>

      <title>When Deep Learning Meets Polyhedral Theory: A Survey</title>

Abstract: In the past decade, deep learning became the prevalent methodology for predictive modeling thanks to the remarkable accuracy of deep neural networks in tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing. Meanwhile, the structure of neural networks converged back to simpler representations based on piecewise constant and piecewise linear functions such as the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which became the most commonly used type of activation function in neural networks. That made certain types of network structure $\unicode{x2014}$such as the typical fully-connected feedforward neural network$\unicode{x2014}$ amenable to analysis through polyhedral theory and to the application of methodologies such as Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for a variety of purposes. In this paper, we survey the main topics emerging from this fast-paced area of work, which bring a fresh perspective to understanding neural networks in more detail as well as to applying linear optimization techniques to train, verify, and reduce the size of such networks.</description>

      <title>Understanding Emergent In-Context Learning from a Kernel Regression Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have initiated a paradigm shift in transfer learning. In contrast to the classic pretraining-then-finetuning procedure, in order to use LLMs for downstream prediction tasks, one only needs to provide a few demonstrations, known as in-context examples, without adding more or updating existing model parameters. This in-context learning (ICL) capability of LLMs is intriguing, and it is not yet fully understood how pretrained LLMs acquire such capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the reason why a transformer-based language model can accomplish in-context learning after pre-training on a general language corpus by proposing a kernel-regression perspective of understanding LLMs' ICL bahaviors when faced with in-context examples. More concretely, we first prove that Bayesian inference on in-context prompts can be asymptotically understood as kernel regression $\hat y = \sum_i y_i K(x, x_i)/\sum_i K(x, x_i)$ as the number of in-context demonstrations grows. Then, we empirically investigate the in-context behaviors of language models. We find that during ICL, the attention and hidden features in LLMs match the behaviors of a kernel regression. Finally, our theory provides insights into multiple phenomena observed in the ICL field: why retrieving demonstrative samples similar to test samples can help, why ICL performance is sensitive to the output formats, and why ICL accuracy benefits from selecting in-distribution and representative samples. Code and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/Glaciohound/Explain-ICL-As-Kernel-Regression.</description>

      <title>Data-Induced Interactions of Sparse Sensors Using Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-dimensional empirical data in science and engineering frequently have a low-rank structure and can be represented as a combination of just a few eigenmodes. Because of this structure, we can use just a few spatially localized sensor measurements to reconstruct the full state of a complex system. The quality of this reconstruction, especially in the presence of sensor noise, depends significantly on the spatial configuration of the sensors. Multiple algorithms based on gappy interpolation and QR factorization have been proposed to optimize sensor placement. Here, instead of an algorithm that outputs a single "optimal" sensor configuration, we take a statistical mechanics view to compute the full landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. The two key advances of this paper are the recasting of the sensor placement landscape in an Ising model form and a regularized reconstruction that significantly decreases reconstruction error for few sensors. In addition, we provide first uncertainty quantification of the sparse sensing reconstruction and open questions about the shape of reconstruction risk curve. Mapping out these data-induced sensor interactions allows combining them with external selection criteria and anticipating sensor replacement impacts.</description>

      <title>ResWCAE: Biometric Pattern Image Denoising Using Residual Wavelet-Conditioned Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The utilization of biometric authentication with pattern images is increasingly popular in compact Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, the reliability of such systems can be compromised by image quality issues, particularly in the presence of high levels of noise. While state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms designed for generic image denoising have shown promise, their large number of parameters and lack of optimization for unique biometric pattern retrieval make them unsuitable for these devices and scenarios. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight and robust deep learning architecture, the Residual Wavelet-Conditioned Convolutional Autoencoder (Res-WCAE) with a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) regularization, designed specifically for fingerprint image denoising. Res-WCAE comprises two encoders - an image encoder and a wavelet encoder - and one decoder. Residual connections between the image encoder and decoder are leveraged to preserve fine-grained spatial features, where the bottleneck layer conditioned on the compressed representation of features obtained from the wavelet encoder using approximation and detail subimages in the wavelet-transform domain. The effectiveness of Res-WCAE is evaluated against several state-of-the-art denoising methods, and the experimental results demonstrate that Res-WCAE outperforms these methods, particularly for heavily degraded fingerprint images in the presence of high levels of noise. Overall, Res-WCAE shows promise as a solution to the challenges faced by biometric authentication systems in compact IoT devices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum variational circuits have gained significant attention due to their applications in the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and quantum machine learning research. This work introduces a novel class of classical probabilistic circuits designed for generating approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems constructed using two-bit stochastic matrices. Through a numerical study, we investigate the performance of our proposed variational circuits in solving the Max-Cut problem on various graphs of increasing sizes. Our classical algorithm demonstrates improved performance for several graph types to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Our findings suggest that evaluating the performance of quantum variational circuits against variational circuits with sub-universal gate sets is a valuable benchmark for identifying areas where quantum variational circuits can excel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of downstream tasks, a significant concern revolves around their propensity to exhibit hallucinations: LLMs occasionally generate content that diverges from the user input, contradicts previously generated context, or misaligns with established world knowledge. This phenomenon poses a substantial challenge to the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we survey recent efforts on the detection, explanation, and mitigation of hallucination, with an emphasis on the unique challenges posed by LLMs. We present taxonomies of the LLM hallucination phenomena and evaluation benchmarks, analyze existing approaches aiming at mitigating LLM hallucination, and discuss potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14326v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward.
  This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is tight.
  Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage. Our protocol can be naturally extended to a protocol that learns the eigenvalues of Pauli terms within any subset $A$ of a Pauli channel with $O(\log\log(|A|)/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Operator learning for hyperbolic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the first rigorously justified probabilistic algorithm for recovering the solution operator of a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) in two variables from input-output training pairs. The primary challenge of recovering the solution operator of hyperbolic PDEs is the presence of characteristics, along which the associated Green's function is discontinuous. Therefore, a central component of our algorithm is a rank detection scheme that identifies the approximate location of the characteristics. By combining the randomized singular value decomposition with an adaptive hierarchical partition of the domain, we construct an approximant to the solution operator using $O(\Psi_\epsilon^{-1}\epsilon^{-7}\log(\Xi_\epsilon^{-1}\epsilon^{-1}))$ input-output pairs with relative error $O(\Xi_\epsilon^{-1}\epsilon)$ in the operator norm as $\epsilon\to0$, with high probability. Here, $\Psi_\epsilon$ represents the existence of degenerate singular values of the solution operator, and $\Xi_\epsilon$ measures the quality of the training data. Our assumptions on the regularity of the coefficients of the hyperbolic PDE are relatively weak given that hyperbolic PDEs do not have the ``instantaneous smoothing effect'' of elliptic and parabolic PDEs, and our recovery rate improves as the regularity of the coefficients increases.</description>

Abstract: Deep Learning models are incredibly data-hungry and require very large labeled datasets for supervised learning. As a consequence, these models often suffer from overfitting, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world examples. Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic images based on textual inputs. Leveraging the substantial datasets used to train these diffusion models, we propose a technique to utilize generated images to augment existing datasets. This paper explores various strategies for effective data augmentation to improve the out-of-domain generalization capabilities of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Diversity Improves Vision-Language Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large. All translated captions and metadata (language, CLIP score, etc.) are available on HuggingFace.</description>

      <title>Efficient Imitation Without Demonstrations via Value-Penalized Auxiliary Control from Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common approaches to providing feedback in reinforcement learning are the use of hand-crafted rewards or full-trajectory expert demonstrations. Alternatively, one can use examples of completed tasks, but such an approach can be extremely sample inefficient. We introduce value-penalized auxiliary control from examples (VPACE), an algorithm that significantly improves exploration in example-based control by adding examples of simple auxiliary tasks and an above-success-level value penalty. Across both simulated and real robotic environments, we show that our approach substantially improves learning efficiency for challenging tasks, while maintaining bounded value estimates. Preliminary results also suggest that VPACE may learn more efficiently than the more common approaches of using full trajectories or true sparse rewards.

Proprietary models like GPT-4 offer strong performance but are costly and cannot be self-hosted, raising security and privacy concerns. Open-source alternatives offer flexibility and lower token costs but lag in performance. We introduce Guidance Elicitation and Retrieval (GER), a prompt-based knowledge distillation framework where a high-performance teacher LLM coaches a lower-performance student without modifying the student's parameters. GER extracts tactical guidance for a wide range of dialog scenarios from the teacher and stores these scenario-guidance pairs in a structured library. At inference time, the student retrieves the relevant guidance and integrates it into its prompt. While GER training can be bootstrapped entirely with synthetic data, its modular design lets it seamlessly augment the synthetic data with human conversational logs. In addition, the modular design enables easy auditing and updating of the guidance library as new scenarios and constraints emerge. Experiments show GER's guidance-based coaching outperforms both example output based fine-tuning and non-customized guidance baselines, and generalizes across other contexts and student models. The GER framework is potentially extensible to coach human service agents.</description>

      <title>The Whole Is Bigger Than the Sum of Its Parts: Modeling Individual Annotators to Capture Emotional Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotion expression and perception are nuanced, complex, and highly subjective processes. When multiple annotators label emotional data, the resulting labels contain high variability. Most speech emotion recognition tasks address this by averaging annotator labels as ground truth. However, this process omits the nuance of emotion and inter-annotator variability, which are important signals to capture. Previous work has attempted to learn distributions to capture emotion variability, but these methods also lose information about the individual annotators. We address these limitations by learning to predict individual annotators and by introducing a novel method to create distributions from continuous model outputs that permit the learning of emotion distributions during model training. We show that this combined approach can result in emotion distributions that are more accurate than those seen in prior work, in both within- and cross-corpus settings.</description>

      <title>Social Perception of Faces in a Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore social perception of human faces in CLIP, a widely used open-source vision-language model. To this end, we compare the similarity in CLIP embeddings between different textual prompts and a set of face images. Our textual prompts are constructed from well-validated social psychology terms denoting social perception. The face images are synthetic and are systematically and independently varied along six dimensions: the legally protected attributes of age, gender, and race, as well as facial expression, lighting, and pose. Independently and systematically manipulating face attributes allows us to study the effect of each on social perception and avoids confounds that can occur in wild-collected data due to uncontrolled systematic correlations between attributes. Thus, our findings are experimental rather than observational. Our main findings are three. First, while CLIP is trained on the widest variety of images and texts, it is able to make fine-grained human-like social judgments on face images. Second, age, gender, and race do systematically impact CLIP's social perception of faces, suggesting an undesirable bias in CLIP vis-a-vis legally protected attributes. Most strikingly, we find a strong pattern of bias concerning the faces of Black women, where CLIP produces extreme values of social perception across different ages and facial expressions. Third, facial expression impacts social perception more than age and lighting as much as age. The last finding predicts that studies that do not control for unprotected visual attributes may reach the wrong conclusions on bias. Our novel method of investigation, which is founded on the social psychology literature and on the experiments involving the manipulation of individual attributes, yields sharper and more reliable observations than previous observational methods and may be applied to study biases in any vision-language model.</description>

      <title>Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Prompt Injection Attacks to LLMs via Poisoning Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompt injection attack, where an attacker injects a prompt into the original one, aiming to make an Large Language Model (LLM) follow the injected prompt to perform an attacker-chosen task, represent a critical security threat. Existing attacks primarily focus on crafting these injections at inference time, treating the LLM itself as a static target. Our experiments show that these attacks achieve some success, but there is still significant room for improvement. In this work, we introduces a more foundational attack vector: poisoning the LLM's alignment process to amplify the success of future prompt injection attacks. Specifically, we propose PoisonedAlign, a method that strategically creates poisoned alignment samples to poison an LLM's alignment dataset. Our experiments across five LLMs and two alignment datasets show that when even a small fraction of the alignment data is poisoned, the resulting model becomes substantially more vulnerable to a wide range of prompt injection attacks. Crucially, this vulnerability is instilled while the LLM's performance on standard capability benchmarks remains largely unchanged, making the manipulation difficult to detect through automated, general-purpose performance evaluations. The code for implementing the attack is available at https://github.com/Sadcardation/PoisonedAlign.</description>

      <title>NeRF-Aug: Data Augmentation for Robotics with Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training a policy that can generalize to unknown objects is a long standing challenge within the field of robotics. The performance of a policy often drops significantly in situations where an object in the scene was not seen during training. To solve this problem, we present NeRF-Aug, a novel method that is capable of teaching a policy to interact with objects that are not present in the dataset. This approach differs from existing approaches by leveraging the speed, photorealism, and 3D consistency of a neural radiance field for augmentation. NeRF-Aug both creates more photorealistic data and runs 63% faster than existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 5 tasks with 9 novel objects that are not present in the expert demonstrations. We achieve an average performance boost of 55.6% when comparing our method to the next best method. You can see video results at https://nerf-aug.github.io.</description>

      <title>Testing classical properties from quantum data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Properties of Boolean functions can often be tested much faster than the functions can be learned. However, this advantage usually disappears when testers are limited to random samples of a function $f$--a natural setting for data science--rather than queries. In this work we initiate the study of a quantum version of this "data science scenario": quantum algorithms that test properties of $f$ solely from quantum data in the form of copies of the function state $|f\rangle \propto \sum_x|x,f(x)\rangle$.
  $\bullet$ New tests. For three well-established properties--monotonicity, symmetry, and triangle-freeness--we show that the speedup lost when restricting classical testers to sampled data can be recovered by quantum algorithms operating solely from quantum data.
  $\bullet$ Inadequacy of Fourier sampling. Our new testers use techniques beyond quantum Fourier sampling, and we show that this necessary. In particular, there is no constant-complexity tester for symmetry relying solely on Fourier sampling and random classical samples.
  $\bullet$ Classical queries vs. quantum data. We exhibit a testing problem that can be solved from $O(1)$ classical queries but that requires $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ function state copies. The Forrelation problem provides a separation of the same magnitude in the opposite direction, so we conclude that quantum data and classical queries are "maximally incomparable" resources for testing.
  $\bullet$ Towards lower bounds. We also begin the study of lower bounds for testing from quantum data. For quantum monotonicity testing, we prove that the ensembles of Goldreich et al. (2000) and Black (2023), which give exponential lower bounds for classical sample-based testing, do not yield any nontrivial lower bounds for testing from quantum data. New insights specific to quantum data will be required for proving copy complexity lower bounds for testing in this model.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Democratize Access to Costly Datasets for Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unequal access to costly datasets essential for empirical research has long hindered researchers from disadvantaged institutions, limiting their ability to contribute to their fields and advance their careers. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by automating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a novel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately 10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000 10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each at a cost under US $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours needed for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for commercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research community by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new avenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.</description>

      <title>FM2DS: Few-Shot Multimodal Multihop Data Synthesis with Knowledge Distillation for Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07030v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal multihop question answering (MMQA) requires reasoning over images and text from multiple sources. Despite advances in visual question answering, this multihop setting remains underexplored due to a lack of quality datasets. Existing methods focus on single-hop, single-modality, or short texts, limiting real-world applications like interpreting educational documents with long, multimodal content. To fill this gap, we introduce FM2DS, the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset for MMQA. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure data quality. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks: MultimodalQA and WebQA. Our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) score on average. Additionally, we introduce M2QA-Bench with 1k samples, the first benchmark for MMQA on long documents, generated using FM2DS and refined by human annotators. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating MMQA models.</description>

      <title>Marigold-DC: Zero-Shot Monocular Depth Completion with Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depth completion upgrades sparse depth measurements into dense depth maps guided by a conventional image. Existing methods for this highly ill-posed task operate in tightly constrained settings and tend to struggle when applied to images outside the training domain or when the available depth measurements are sparse, irregularly distributed, or of varying density. Inspired by recent advances in monocular depth estimation, we reframe depth completion as an image-conditional depth map generation guided by sparse measurements. Our method, Marigold-DC, builds on a pretrained latent diffusion model for monocular depth estimation and injects the depth observations as test-time guidance via an optimization scheme that runs in tandem with the iterative inference of denoising diffusion. The method exhibits excellent zero-shot generalization across a diverse range of environments and handles even extremely sparse guidance effectively. Our results suggest that contemporary monocular depth priors greatly robustify depth completion: it may be better to view the task as recovering dense depth from (dense) image pixels, guided by sparse depth; rather than as inpainting (sparse) depth, guided by an image.

      <description>arXiv:2412.14222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, data science agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), known as "data agents," have shown significant potential to transform the traditional data analysis paradigm. This survey provides an overview of the evolution, capabilities, and applications of LLM-based data agents, highlighting their role in simplifying complex data tasks and lowering the entry barrier for users without related expertise. We explore current trends in the design of LLM-based frameworks, detailing essential features such as planning, reasoning, reflection, multi-agent collaboration, user interface, knowledge integration, and system design, which enable agents to address data-centric problems with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we analyze several case studies to demonstrate the practical applications of various data agents in real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to advance the development of data agents into intelligent statistical analysis software.</description>

      <title>Deep learning joint extremes of metocean variables using the SPAR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning framework for estimating multivariate joint extremes of metocean variables, based on the Semi-Parametric Angular-Radial (SPAR) model. When considered in polar coordinates, the problem of modelling multivariate extremes is transformed to one of modelling an angular density, and the tail of a univariate radial variable conditioned on angle. In the SPAR approach, the tail of the radial variable is modelled using a generalised Pareto (GP) distribution, providing a natural extension of univariate extreme value theory to the multivariate setting. In this work, we show how the method can be applied in higher dimensions, using a case study for five metocean variables: wind speed, wind direction, wave height, wave period, and wave direction. The angular variable is modelled using a kernel density method, while the parameters of the GP model are approximated using fully-connected deep neural networks. Our approach provides great flexibility in the dependence structures that can be represented, together with computationally efficient routines for training the model. Furthermore, the application of the method requires fewer assumptions about the underlying distribution(s) compared to existing approaches, and an asymptotically justified means for extrapolating outside the range of observations. Using various diagnostic plots, we show that the fitted models provide a good description of the joint extremes of the metocean variables considered.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Depth-Based Pipeline for Selfie Image Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Portraits or selfie images taken from a close distance typically suffer from perspective distortion. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning-based rectification pipeline to mitigate the effects of perspective distortion. We learn to predict the facial depth by training a deep CNN. The estimated depth is utilized to adjust the camera-to-subject distance by moving the camera farther, increasing the camera focal length, and reprojecting the 3D image features to the new perspective. The reprojected features are then fed to an inpainting module to fill in the missing pixels. We leverage a differentiable renderer to enable end-to-end training of our depth estimation and feature extraction nets to improve the rectified outputs. To boost the results of the inpainting module, we incorporate an auxiliary module to predict the horizontal movement of the camera which decreases the area that requires hallucination of challenging face parts such as ears. Unlike previous works, we process the full-frame input image at once without cropping the subject's face and processing it separately from the rest of the body, eliminating the need for complex post-processing steps to attach the face back to the subject's body. To train our network, we utilize the popular game engine Unreal Engine to generate a large synthetic face dataset containing various subjects, head poses, expressions, eyewear, clothes, and lighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our rectification pipeline outperforms previous methods, and produces comparable results with a time-consuming 3D GAN-based method while being more than 260 times faster.</description>

      <title>STLCG++: A Masking Approach for Differentiable Signal Temporal Logic Specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) offers a concise yet expressive framework for specifying and reasoning about spatio-temporal behaviors of robotic systems. Attractively, STL admits the notion of robustness, the degree to which an input signal satisfies or violates an STL specification, thus providing a nuanced evaluation of system performance. In particular, the differentiability of STL robustness enables direct integration to robotic workflows that rely on gradient-based optimization, such as trajectory optimization and deep learning. However, existing approaches to evaluating and differentiating STL robustness rely on recurrent computations, which become inefficient with longer sequences, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we present STLCG++, a masking-based approach that parallelizes STL robustness evaluation and backpropagation across timesteps, \revised{achieving more than 1000$\times$ faster computation time than the recurrent approach (STLCG++).}{achieving significant speed-ups compared to a recurrent approach.} We also introduce a smoothing technique to enable the differentiation of time interval bounds, thereby expanding STL's applicability in gradient-based optimization tasks involving spatial and temporal variables. Finally, we demonstrate STLCG++'s benefits through three robotics use cases and provide JAX and PyTorch libraries for seamless integration into modern robotics workflows.

      <title>Think Small, Plan Smart: Minimalist Symbolic Abstraction and Heuristic Subspace Search for LLM-Guided Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable task planning is pivotal for achieving long-horizon autonomy in real-world robotic systems. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising interface for translating complex and ambiguous natural language instructions into actionable plans. However, their probabilistic and opaque nature often leads to logically inconsistent or infeasible outputs. To address these limitations, recent frameworks combine LLMs with symbolic planners by first generating action models (Planning Domain Definition Language) and then applying heuristic search. Although promising, such systems still suffer from representation redundancy and exponential search complexity, often resulting in inefficient or overly long plans. To improve planning efficiency and effectiveness, we propose PLAHX (Planning from Language using Abstraction and Heuristic eXploration), a two-stage LLM-symbolic planning framework that integrates abstract symbolic representations with meta-heuristic subspace search in a parallel and iterative fashion. Rather than relying on verbose LLM-generated domain models, we introduce a minimalist symbolic abstraction pipeline that preserves semantic fidelity while eliminating redundancy. Our approach redefines LLM-symbolic planning not by making LLMs smarter, but by reducing the symbolic search space adaptively. Empirical results across four challenging domains, including block stacking and robotic mobile grasping, show that our approach improves the success rate by 21.47% on average, while reducing token consumption by 13% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion with Link-Aware Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to predict missing links in multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging information from various modalities alongside structural data. Existing MMKGC approaches primarily extend traditional knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, which often require creating an embedding for every entity. This results in large model sizes and inefficiencies in integrating multimodal information, particularly for real-world graphs. Meanwhile, Transformer-based models have demonstrated competitive performance in knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, their focus on single-modal knowledge limits their capacity to utilize cross-modal information. Recently, Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in cross-modal tasks but are constrained by the high cost of training. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates Transformer-based KGE models with cross-modal context generated by pre-trained VLMs, thereby extending their applicability to MMKGC. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained VLM to transform relevant visual information from entities and their neighbors into textual sequences. We then frame KGC as a sequence-to-sequence task, fine-tuning the model with the generated cross-modal context. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces model size compared to traditional KGE approaches while achieving competitive performance across multiple large-scale datasets with minimal hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the systematic study of decision-theoretic metrics in the design and analysis of algorithms with machine-learned predictions. We introduce approaches based on both deterministic measures such as distance-based evaluation, that help us quantify how close the algorithm is to an ideal solution, and stochastic measures that balance the trade-off between the algorithm's performance and the risk associated with the imperfect oracle. These approaches allow us to quantify the algorithm's performance across the full spectrum of the prediction error, and thus choose the best algorithm within an entire class of otherwise incomparable ones. We apply our framework to three well-known problems from online decision making, namely ski-rental, one-max search, and contract scheduling.</description>

      <title>Understanding Model Calibration -- A gentle introduction and visual exploration of calibration and the expected calibration error (ECE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19047v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To be considered reliable, a model must be calibrated so that its confidence in each decision closely reflects its true outcome. In this blogpost we'll take a look at the most commonly used definition for calibration and then dive into a frequently used evaluation measure for model calibration. We'll then cover some of the drawbacks of this measure and how these surfaced the need for additional notions of calibration, which require their own new evaluation measures. This post is not intended to be an in-depth dissection of all works on calibration, nor does it focus on how to calibrate models. Instead, it is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the different notions and their evaluation measures as well as to re-highlight some issues with a measure that is still widely used to evaluate calibration.</description>

      <title>Graceful forgetting: Memory as a process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rational framework is proposed to explain how we accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded memory. Memory is stored as statistics organized into structures that are repeatedly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. Repeated summarization requires an intensive ongoing process guided by heuristics that help optimize the memory for future needs. Sensory input is rapidly encoded as simple statistics that are progressively elaborated into more abstract constructs. This framework differs from previous accounts of memory by its emphasis on a process that is intensive, complex, and expensive, its reliance on statistics as a representation of memory, and the use of heuristics to guide the choice of statistics at each summarization step. The framework is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive knowledge of memory, and bring us closer to an understanding of memory in functional and mechanistic terms.</description>

      <title>FOCUS on Contamination: A Geospatial Deep Learning Framework with a Noise-Aware Loss for Surface Water PFAS Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals found in products like non-stick cookware, are unfortunately persistent environmental pollutants with severe health risks. Accurately mapping PFAS contamination is crucial for guiding targeted remediation efforts and protecting public and environmental health, yet detection across large regions remains challenging due to the cost of testing and the difficulty of simulating their spread. In this work, we introduce FOCUS, a geospatial deep learning framework with a label noise-aware loss function, to predict PFAS contamination in surface water over large regions. By integrating hydrological flow data, land cover information, and proximity to known PFAS sources, our approach leverages both spatial and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of our approach through extensive ablation studies, robustness analysis, real-world validation, and comparative analyses against baselines like sparse segmentation, as well as existing scientific methods, including Kriging and pollutant transport simulations. Results and expert feedback highlight our framework's potential for scalable PFAS monitoring.</description>

      <title>TeleRAG: Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation Inference with Lookahead Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) with external data sources to enhance factual correctness and domain coverage. Modern RAG pipelines rely on large datastores, leading to system challenges in latency-sensitive deployments, especially when GPU memory is limited. To address these challenges, we propose TeleRAG, an efficient inference system that reduces RAG latency with minimal GPU memory requirements. The core innovation of TeleRAG is lookahead retrieval, a prefetching mechanism that anticipates required data and transfers it from CPU to GPU in parallel with LLM generation. By leveraging the modularity of RAG pipelines, the inverted file index (IVF) search algorithm and similarities between queries, TeleRAG optimally overlaps data movement and computation. Experimental results demonstrate that TeleRAG achieves up to a 1.53x average reduction in end-to-end latency for single-query inference and up to 1.83x average improvement in throughput for batch-query scenarios compared to state-of-the-art systems. This confirms the practical utility of TeleRAG for faster and more memory-efficient deployments of advanced RAG applications.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Decoding: Mitigating Hallucination via Evaluating the Factuality of Partial Response during Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, they remain susceptible to hallucinations -- generating plausible yet factually incorrect contents. Existing methods to mitigating such risk often rely on sampling multiple full-length generations, which introduces significant response latency and becomes ineffective when the model consistently produces hallucinated outputs with high confidence. To address these limitations, we introduce Monitoring Decoding (MD), a novel framework that dynamically monitors the generation process and selectively applies in-process interventions, focusing on revising crucial tokens responsible for hallucinations. Instead of waiting until completion of multiple full-length generations, we identify hallucination-prone tokens during generation using a monitor function, and further refine these tokens through a tree-based decoding strategy. This approach ensures an enhanced factual accuracy and coherence in the generated output while maintaining efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that MD consistently outperforms self-consistency-based approaches in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving higher factual accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization of Representation Uncertainty in Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Computer Vision have introduced the concept of pretrained representation uncertainty, enabling zero-shot uncertainty estimation. This holds significant potential for Earth Observation (EO), where trustworthiness is critical, yet the complexity of EO data poses challenges to uncertainty-aware methods. In this work, we investigate the generalization of representation uncertainty in EO, considering the domain's unique semantic characteristics. We pretrain uncertainties on large EO datasets and propose an evaluation framework to assess their zero-shot performance in multi-label classification and segmentation EO tasks. Our findings reveal that, unlike uncertainties pretrained on natural images, EO-pretraining exhibits strong generalization across unseen EO domains, geographic locations, and target granularities, while maintaining sensitivity to variations in ground sampling distance. We demonstrate the practical utility of pretrained uncertainties showcasing their alignment with task-specific uncertainties in downstream tasks, their sensitivity to real-world EO image noise, and their ability to generate spatial uncertainty estimates out-of-the-box. Initiating the discussion on representation uncertainty in EO, our study provides insights into its strengths and limitations, paving the way for future research in the field.

      <title>Multi-Agent Systems Execute Arbitrary Malicious Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems coordinate LLM-based agents to perform tasks on users' behalf. In real-world applications, multi-agent systems will inevitably interact with untrusted inputs, such as malicious Web content, files, email attachments, and more.
  Using several recently proposed multi-agent frameworks as concrete examples, we demonstrate that adversarial content can hijack control and communication within the system to invoke unsafe agents and functionalities. This results in a complete security breach, up to execution of arbitrary malicious code on the user's device or exfiltration of sensitive data from the user's containerized environment. For example, when agents are instantiated with GPT-4o, Web-based attacks successfully cause the multi-agent system execute arbitrary malicious code in 58-90\% of trials (depending on the orchestrator). In some model-orchestrator configurations, the attack success rate is 100\%. We also demonstrate that these attacks succeed even if individual agents are not susceptible to direct or indirect prompt injection, and even if they refuse to perform harmful actions. We hope that these results will motivate development of trust and security models for multi-agent systems before they are widely deployed.</description>

      <title>Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16974v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&amp;As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.</description>

      <title>Hallucinated Span Detection with Multi-View Attention Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the problem of hallucinated span detection in the outputs of large language models. It has received less attention than output-level hallucination detection despite its practical importance. Prior work has shown that attentions often exhibit irregular patterns when hallucinations occur. Motivated by these findings, we extract features from the attention matrix that provide complementary views capturing (a) whether certain tokens are influential or ignored, (b) whether attention is biased toward specific subsets, and (c) whether a token is generated referring to a narrow or broad context, in the generation. These features are input to a Transformer-based classifier to conduct sequential labelling to identify hallucinated spans. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines on hallucinated span detection with longer input contexts, such as data-to-text and summarisation tasks.</description>

      <title>Tool-as-Interface: Learning Robot Policies from Observing Human Tool Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tool use is essential for enabling robots to perform complex real-world tasks, but learning such skills requires extensive datasets. While teleoperation is widely used, it is slow, delay-sensitive, and poorly suited for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human videos provide a natural way for data collection without specialized hardware, though they pose challenges on robot learning due to viewpoint variations and embodiment gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that transfers tool-use knowledge from humans to robots. To improve the policy's robustness to viewpoint variations, we use two RGB cameras to reconstruct 3D scenes and apply Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis. We reduce the embodiment gap using segmented observations and tool-centric, task-space actions to achieve embodiment-invariant visuomotor policy learning. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness across a diverse suite of tool-use tasks, where our learned policy shows strong generalization and robustness to human perturbations, camera motion, and robot base movement. Our method achieves a 71\% improvement in task success over teleoperation-based diffusion policies and dramatically reduces data collection time by 77\% and 41\% compared to teleoperation and the state-of-the-art interface, respectively.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an innovative design for an all-optical Echo State Network (ESN), an advanced type of reservoir computer known for its universal computational capabilities. Our design enables fully optical implementation of arbitrary ESNs, featuring flexibility in optical matrix multiplication and nonlinear activation. Leveraging the nonlinear characteristics of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), the architecture efficiently realizes measurement-free nonlinear activation. The approach significantly reduces computational overhead and energy consumption compared to traditional software-based methods. Comprehensive simulations validate the system's memory capacity, nonlinear processing strength, and polynomial algebra capabilities, showcasing performance comparable to software ESNs across key benchmark tasks. Our design establishes a feasible, scalable, and universally applicable framework for optical reservoir computing, suitable for diverse machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>SonicSieve: Bringing Directional Speech Extraction to Smartphones Using Acoustic Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imagine placing your smartphone on a table in a noisy restaurant and clearly capturing the voices of friends seated around you, or recording a lecturer's voice with clarity in a reverberant auditorium. We introduce SonicSieve, the first intelligent directional speech extraction system for smartphones using a bio-inspired acoustic microstructure. Our passive design embeds directional cues onto incoming speech without any additional electronics. It attaches to the in-line mic of low-cost wired earphones which can be attached to smartphones. We present an end-to-end neural network that processes the raw audio mixtures in real-time on mobile devices. Our results show that SonicSieve achieves a signal quality improvement of 5.0 dB when focusing on a 30{\deg} angular region. Additionally, the performance of our system based on only two microphones exceeds that of conventional 5-microphone arrays.</description>

      <title>LogicTree: Structured Proof Exploration for Coherent and Rigorous Logical Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.</description>

      <title>EasyEdit2: An Easy-to-use Steering Framework for Editing Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EasyEdit2, a framework designed to enable plug-and-play adjustability for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors. EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkfoiPfp5rQ for a quick introduction.</description>

      <title>MAYA: Addressing Inconsistencies in Generative Password Guessing through a Unified Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have led to their application in password guessing, with the aim of replicating the complexity, structure, and patterns of human-created passwords. Despite their potential, inconsistencies and inadequate evaluation methodologies in prior research have hindered meaningful comparisons and a comprehensive, unbiased understanding of their capabilities. This paper introduces MAYA, a unified, customizable, plug-and-play benchmarking framework designed to facilitate the systematic characterization and benchmarking of generative password-guessing models in the context of trawling attacks. Using MAYA, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of six state-of-the-art approaches, which we re-implemented and adapted to ensure standardization. Our evaluation spans eight real-world password datasets and covers an exhaustive set of advanced testing scenarios, totaling over 15,000 compute hours. Our findings indicate that these models effectively capture different aspects of human password distribution and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. However, their effectiveness varies significantly with long and complex passwords. Through our evaluation, sequential models consistently outperform other generative architectures and traditional password-guessing tools, demonstrating unique capabilities in generating accurate and complex guesses. Moreover, the diverse password distributions learned by the models enable a multi-model attack that outperforms the best individual model. By releasing MAYA, we aim to foster further research, providing the community with a new tool to consistently and reliably benchmark generative password-guessing models. Our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/williamcorrias/MAYA-Password-Benchmarking.</description>

Abstract: PEER-REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED IN IEEE- ISTAS 2025
  The rapid evolution of Generative AI (GenAI) has introduced unprecedented opportunities while presenting complex challenges around ethics, accountability, and societal impact. This paper draws on a literature review, established governance frameworks, and industry roundtable discussions to identify core principles for integrating responsible GenAI governance into diverse organizational structures. Our objective is to provide actionable recommendations for a balanced, risk-based governance approach that enables both innovation and oversight. Findings emphasize the need for adaptable risk assessment tools, continuous monitoring practices, and cross-sector collaboration to establish trustworthy GenAI. These insights provide a structured foundation and Responsible GenAI Guide (ResAI) for organizations to align GenAI initiatives with ethical, legal, and operational best practices.</description>

      <title>Better To Ask in English? Evaluating Factual Accuracy of Multilingual LLMs in English and Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant effectiveness across various languages, particularly in high-resource languages such as English. However, their performance in terms of factual accuracy across other low-resource languages, especially Indic languages, remains an area of investigation. In this study, we assess the factual accuracy of LLMs - GPT-4o, Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-2B, and Llama-3.1-8B - by comparing their performance in English and Indic languages using the IndicQuest dataset, which contains question-answer pairs in English and 19 Indic languages. By asking the same questions in English and their respective Indic translations, we analyze whether the models are more reliable for regional context questions in Indic languages or when operating in English. Our findings reveal that LLMs often perform better in English, even for questions rooted in Indic contexts. Notably, we observe a higher tendency for hallucination in responses generated in low-resource Indic languages, highlighting challenges in the multilingual understanding capabilities of current LLMs.</description>

      <title>A dynamic view of some anomalous phenomena in SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been observed by Belkin et al.\ that over-parametrized neural networks exhibit a `double descent' phenomenon. That is, as the model complexity (as reflected in the number of features) increases, the test error initially decreases, then increases, and then decreases again. A counterpart of this phenomenon in the time domain has been noted in the context of epoch-wise training, viz., the test error decreases with the number of iterates, then increases, then decreases again. Another anomalous phenomenon is that of \textit{grokking} wherein two regimes of descent are interrupted by a third regime wherein the mean loss remains almost constant. This note presents a plausible explanation for these and related phenomena by using the theory of two time scale stochastic approximation, applied to the continuous time limit of the gradient dynamics. This gives a novel perspective for an already well studied theme.</description>

      <title>Blending 3D Geometry and Machine Learning for Multi-View Stereopsis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.</description>

      <title>Kernel Embeddings and the Separation of Measure Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that kernel covariance embeddings lead to information-theoretically perfect separation of distinct probability distributions. In statistical terms, we establish that testing for the equality of two probability measures on a compact and separable metric space is equivalent to testing for the singularity between two centered Gaussian measures on a reproducing kernel Hilbert Space. The corresponding Gaussians are defined via the notion of kernel covariance embedding of a probability measure, and the Hilbert space is that generated by the embedding kernel. Distinguishing singular Gaussians is fundamentally simpler from an information-theoretic perspective than non-parametric two-sample testing, particularly in complex or high-dimensional domains. This is because singular Gaussians are supported on essentially separate and affine subspaces. Our proof leverages the classical Feldman-Hajek dichotomy, and shows that even a small perturbation of a distribution will be maximally magnified through its Gaussian embedding. This ``separation of measure phenomenon'' appears to be a blessing of infinite dimensionality, by means of embedding, with the potential to inform the design of efficient inference tools in considerable generality. The elicitation of this phenomenon also appears to crystallize, in a precise and simple mathematical statement, the outstanding empirical effectiveness of the so-called ``kernel trick".</description>

      <title>Unearthing Gems from Stones: Policy Optimization with Negative Sample Augmentation for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14403v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.</description>

      <title>Self-Evolving Curriculum for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Steering LVLMs via Sparse Autoencoder for Hallucination Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on multimodal tasks. However, they still suffer from hallucinations, generating text inconsistent with visual input, posing significant risks in real-world applications. Existing approaches to address this issue focus on incorporating external knowledge bases, alignment training, or decoding strategies, all of which require substantial computational cost and time. Recent works try to explore more efficient alternatives by adjusting LVLMs' internal representations. Although promising, these methods may cause hallucinations to be insufficiently suppressed or lead to excessive interventions that negatively affect normal semantics. In this work, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify semantic directions closely associated with faithfulness or hallucination, extracting more precise and disentangled hallucination-related representations. Our analysis demonstrates that interventions along the identified faithful direction can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory direction can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a plug-and-play method based on SAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability across different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead. The code is available at https://github.com/huazhenglin2003/SSL.</description>

      <title>Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Model Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learned Controllers for Agile Quadrotors in Pursuit-Evasion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of agile 1v1 quadrotor pursuit-evasion, where a pursuer and an evader learn to outmaneuver each other through reinforcement learning (RL). Such settings face two major challenges: non-stationarity, since each agent's evolving policy alters the environment dynamics and destabilizes training, and catastrophic forgetting, where a policy overfits to the current adversary and loses effectiveness against previously encountered strategies. To tackle these issues, we propose an Asynchronous Multi-Stage Population-Based (AMSPB) algorithm. At each stage, the pursuer and evader are trained asynchronously against a frozen pool of opponents sampled from a growing population of past and current policies, stabilizing training and ensuring exposure to diverse behaviors. Within this framework, we train neural network controllers that output either velocity commands or body rates with collective thrust. Experiments in a high-fidelity simulator show that: (i) AMSPB-trained RL policies outperform RL and geometric baselines; (ii) body-rate-and-thrust controllers achieve more agile flight than velocity-based controllers, leading to better pursuit-evasion performance; (iii) AMSPB yields stable, monotonic gains across stages; and (iv) trained policies in one arena size generalize fairly well to other sizes without retraining.</description>

      <title>HueManity: Probing Fine-Grained Visual Perception in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03194v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Hopscotch: Discovering and Skipping Redundancies in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern causal language models stack many attention blocks to improve performance, but not all blocks are necessary for every task. We propose Hopscotch, a simple yet effective method that identifies and skips attention blocks with least contributions to a task and adapts to preserve output quality. Hopscotch jointly optimizes which blocks to skip and how to scale the outputs of the remaining layers. By introducing lightweight, trainable scaling parameters to attention and MLP blocks, it mitigates distribution shifts in hidden states caused by removing attention blocks. Hopscotch does not modify model weights or require access to pretraining or instruction-tuning data, and is compatible with existing model compression techniques. When applied to $\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B}$ and $\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}$, Hopscotch achieves less than a 2% drop in performance even after skipping four attention blocks.</description>

      <title>Recycling the Web: A Method to Enhance Pre-training Data Quality and Quantity for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall" of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at 1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data. We make our high-quality synthetic data publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/recycling_the_web.</description>

Abstract: Research on generative systems in music has seen considerable attention and growth in recent years. A variety of attempts have been made to systematically evaluate such systems.
  We present an interdisciplinary review of the common evaluation targets, methodologies, and metrics for the evaluation of both system output and model use, covering subjective and objective approaches, qualitative and quantitative approaches, as well as empirical and computational methods. We examine the benefits and limitations of these approaches from a musicological, an engineering, and an HCI perspective.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Sensitivity Analysis in Optimal Treatment Regimes and Causal Decomposition with Individualized Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal decomposition analysis aims to assess the effect of modifying risk factors on reducing social disparities in outcomes. Recently, this analysis has incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption, developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study 2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking method.</description>

Abstract: Language barriers in scientific documents hinder the diffusion and development of science and technologies. However, prior efforts in translating such documents largely overlooked the information in layouts. To bridge the gap, we introduce PDFMathTranslate, the world's first open-source software for translating scientific documents while preserving layouts. Leveraging the most recent advances in large language models and precise layout detection, we contribute to the community with key improvements in precision, flexibility, and efficiency.

      <title>Learning from Scratch: Structurally-masked Transformer for Next Generation Lib-free Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a neural framework for power and timing prediction of multi-stage data path, distinguishing itself from traditional lib-based analytical methods dependent on driver characterization and load simplifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first language-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard cells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform prediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and propagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical parameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method accurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without requiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction, we implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from each stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across the logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete waveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction utilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level encoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality constraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary delay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate SPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse industrial circuits. The proposed framework provides a scalable, structurally adaptable neural alternative to conventional power and timing engines, demonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors.</description>

      <title>Likelihood Ratio Tests by Kernel Gaussian Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel kernel-based nonparametric two-sample test, employing the combined use of kernel mean and kernel covariance embedding. Our test builds on recent results showing how such combined embeddings map distinct probability measures to mutually singular Gaussian measures on the kernel's RKHS. Leveraging this ``separation of measure phenomenon", we construct a test statistic based on the relative entropy between the Gaussian embeddings, in effect the likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio is specifically tailored to detect equality versus singularity of two Gaussians, and satisfies a ``$0/\infty$" law, in that it vanishes under the null and diverges under the alternative. To implement the test in finite samples, we introduce a regularised version, calibrated by way of permutation. We prove consistency, establish uniform power guarantees under mild conditions, and discuss how our framework unifies and extends prior approaches based on spectrally regularized MMD. Empirical results on synthetic and real data demonstrate remarkable gains in power compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-dimensional and weak-signal regimes.</description>

      <title>Next Edit Prediction: Learning to Predict Code Edits from Context and Interaction History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions. The code is available at https://github.com/lurf21/NextEditPrediction.</description>

      <title>A learning-driven automatic planning framework for proton PBS treatments of H&amp;N cancers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) treatment planning for head &amp; neck (H&amp;N) cancers involves numerous conflicting objectives, requiring iterative objective parameter adjustments to balance multiple clinical goals. We propose a learning-driven inverse optimizer and integrate it into a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based planning framework to automatically generate high-quality plans for patients with diverse treatment requirements. The inverse optimizer is a learning-to-optimize (L2O) method that predicts update steps by learning from task-specific data distributions. For the first time, long-context processing techniques developed for large language models (LLMs) are utilized to address the scalability limitations of existing L2O methods, enabling simultaneous optimization over a substantially large set of variables. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy network, and the inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable spot monitor unit (MU) values based on the PPO-refined objectives. Moreover, a Swin UnetR dose predictor is trained with prescription- and beam-specific information to estimate the initial objective parameters. In our experiments, total 97 patients with bilateral or ipsilateral H&amp;N cancers are collected for training and testing. Compared with the second-order gradient-based methods, our L2O optimizer improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the time-consuming inverse optimization by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively, and in conjunction with the PPO-based virtual planner, plans are generated within clinically acceptable times, i.e. 2.55 hours in average, and shows improved or comparable organs-at-risk sparing with superior target coverage compared with human-generated plans.</description>

      <title>ISACL: Internal State Analyzer for Copyrighted Training Data Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data, especially when such data is used for training but not intended for distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/changhu73/Internal_states_leakage}</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Model-Based Sequential Decision-Making in Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential decision-making is central to sustainable agricultural management and precision agriculture, where resource inputs must be optimized under uncertainty and over time. However, such decisions must often be made with limited observations, whereas classical bandit and reinforcement learning approaches typically rely on either linear or black-box reward models that may misrepresent domain knowledge or require large amounts of data. We propose a family of \emph{nonlinear, model-based bandit algorithms} that embed domain-specific response curves directly into the exploration-exploitation loop. By coupling (i) principled uncertainty quantification with (ii) closed-form or rapidly computable profit optima, these algorithms achieve sublinear regret and near-optimal sample complexity while preserving interpretability. Theoretical analysis establishes regret and sample complexity bounds, and extensive simulations emulating real-world fertilizer-rate decisions show consistent improvements over both linear and nonparametric baselines (such as linear UCB and $k$-NN UCB) in the low-sample regime, under both well-specified and shape-compatible misspecified models. Because our approach leverages mechanistic insight rather than large data volumes, it is especially suited to resource-constrained settings, supporting sustainable, inclusive, and transparent sequential decision-making across agriculture, environmental management, and allied applications.</description>

      <title>NeurStore: Efficient In-database Deep Learning Model Management System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the prevalence of in-database AI-powered analytics, there is an increasing demand for database systems to efficiently manage the ever-expanding number and size of deep learning models. However, existing database systems typically store entire models as monolithic files or apply compression techniques that overlook the structural characteristics of deep learning models, resulting in suboptimal model storage overhead. This paper presents NeurStore, a novel in-database model management system that enables efficient storage and utilization of deep learning models. First, NeurStore employs a tensor-based model storage engine to enable fine-grained model storage within databases. In particular, we enhance the hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) graph to index tensors, and only store additional deltas for tensors within a predefined similarity threshold to ensure tensor-level deduplication. Second, we propose a delta quantization algorithm that effectively compresses delta tensors, thus achieving a superior compression ratio with controllable model accuracy loss. Finally, we devise a compression-aware model loading mechanism, which improves model utilization performance by enabling direct computation on compressed tensors. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeurStore achieves superior compression ratios and competitive model loading throughput compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>VoltanaLLM: Feedback-Driven Frequency Control and State-Space Routing for Energy-Efficient LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04827</link>

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems increasingly support interactive applications, like real-time chat assistants, code generation tools, and agentic workflows. However, the soaring energy cost of LLM inference presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment. This paper introduces VoltanaLLM, a system for SLO-aware, energy-efficient LLM serving, built from a control theory perspective. VoltanaLLM co-designs frequency scaling and request routing in emerging prefill/decode disaggregated architectures, leveraging their decoupled execution to enable fine-grained phase-specific control. It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller that dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled instances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM in SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to 36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving the way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving. Code of VoltanaLLM is open-sourced on GitHub: https://github.com/Supercomputing-System-AI-Lab/VoltanaLLM.</description>

      <title>AI-in-the-Loop: Privacy Preserving Real-Time Scam Detection and Conversational Scambaiting by Leveraging LLMs and Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing, impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.</description>

      <title>Murphys Laws of AI Alignment: Why the Gap Always Wins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning from human feedback under misspecification. Sometimes human feedback is systematically wrong on certain types of inputs, like a broken compass that points the wrong way in specific regions. We prove that when feedback is biased on a fraction alpha of contexts with bias strength epsilon, any learning algorithm needs exponentially many samples exp(n*alpha*epsilon^2) to distinguish between two possible "true" reward functions that differ only on these problematic contexts. However, if you can identify where feedback is unreliable (a "calibration oracle"), you can focus your limited questions there and overcome the exponential barrier with just O(1/(alpha*epsilon^2)) queries. This quantifies why alignment is hard: rare edge cases with subtly biased feedback create an exponentially hard learning problem unless you know where to look.
  The gap between what we optimize (proxy from human feedback) and what we want (true objective) is fundamentally limited by how common the problematic contexts are (alpha), how wrong the feedback is there (epsilon), and how much the true objectives disagree there (gamma). Murphy's Law for AI alignment: the gap always wins unless you actively route around misspecification.</description>

      <title>FineServe: Precision-Aware KV Slab and Two-Level Scheduling for Heterogeneous Precision LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have significantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models (LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with minimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However, quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation, and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing systems.</description>

      <title>Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</description>

      <title>CogGuide: Human-Like Guidance for Zero-Shot Omni-Modal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select" cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering. Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points, demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch" reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Rhythm Feature Performance Evaluation for Category and Class Level Audio Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks using deep CNNs.</description>

      <title>Toward Quantum Utility in Finance: A Robust Data-Driven Algorithm for Asset Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering financial assets based on return correlations is a fundamental task in portfolio optimization and statistical arbitrage. However, classical clustering methods often fall short when dealing with signed correlation structures, typically requiring lossy transformations and heuristic assumptions such as a fixed number of clusters. In this work, we apply the Graph-based Coalition Structure Generation algorithm (GCS-Q) to directly cluster signed, weighted graphs without relying on such transformations. GCS-Q formulates each partitioning step as a QUBO problem, enabling it to leverage quantum annealing for efficient exploration of exponentially large solution spaces. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world financial data, benchmarking against state-of-the-art classical algorithms such as SPONGE and k-Medoids. Our experiments demonstrate that GCS-Q consistently achieves higher clustering quality, as measured by Adjusted Rand Index and structural balance penalties, while dynamically determining the number of clusters. These results highlight the practical utility of near-term quantum computing for graph-based unsupervised learning in financial applications.</description>

      <title>Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise, which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection (OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed. The proposed OD step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level similarity learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%), demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios. The implementation of Beta-SOD is available at: github.com/waqar3411/Beta-SOD</description>

      <title>Scalable extensions to given-data Sobol' index estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given-data methods for variance-based sensitivity analysis have significantly advanced the feasibility of Sobol' index computation for computationally expensive models and models with many inputs. However, the limitations of existing methods still preclude their application to models with an extremely large number of inputs. In this work, we present practical extensions to the existing given-data Sobol' index method, which allow variance-based sensitivity analysis to be efficiently performed on large models such as neural networks, which have $&gt;10^4$ parameterizable inputs. For models of this size, holding all input-output evaluations simultaneously in memory -- as required by existing methods -- can quickly become impractical. These extensions also support nonstandard input distributions with many repeated values, which are not amenable to equiprobable partitions employed by existing given-data methods.
  Our extensions include a general definition of the given-data Sobol' index estimator with arbitrary partition, a streaming algorithm to process input-output samples in batches, and a heuristic to filter out small indices that are indistinguishable from zero indices due to statistical noise. We show that the equiprobable partition employed in existing given-data methods can introduce significant bias into Sobol' index estimates even at large sample sizes and provide numerical analyses that demonstrate why this can occur. We also show that our streaming algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy and runtimes with lower memory requirements, relative to current methods which process all samples at once. We demonstrate our novel developments on two application problems in neural network modeling.</description>

      <title>Expressive Power of Deep Networks on Manifolds: Simultaneous Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for $k\geq 3$ and $s&lt;k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's low-dimensional geometry.</description>

      <title>Is In-Context Learning Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue that, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an effective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise to unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity, especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied accuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc encoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose generalisability.</description>
