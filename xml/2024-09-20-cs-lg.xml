      <title>A Green Multi-Attribute Client Selection for Over-The-Air Federated Learning: A Grey-Wolf-Optimizer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained attention across various industries for its capability to train machine learning models without centralizing sensitive data. While this approach offers significant benefits such as privacy preservation and decreased communication overhead, it presents several challenges, including deployment complexity and interoperability issues, particularly in heterogeneous scenarios or resource-constrained environments. Over-the-air (OTA) FL was introduced to tackle these challenges by disseminating model updates without necessitating direct device-to-device connections or centralized servers. However, OTA-FL brought forth limitations associated with heightened energy consumption and network latency. In this paper, we propose a multi-attribute client selection framework employing the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) to strategically control the number of participants in each round and optimize the OTA-FL process while considering accuracy, energy, delay, reliability, and fairness constraints of participating devices. We evaluate the performance of our multi-attribute client selection approach in terms of model loss minimization, convergence time reduction, and energy efficiency. In our experimental evaluation, we assessed and compared the performance of our approach against the existing state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GWO-based client selection outperforms these baselines across various metrics. Specifically, our approach achieves a notable reduction in model loss, accelerates convergence time, and enhances energy efficiency while maintaining high fairness and reliability indicators.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of pretrained language models on music understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music-text multimodal systems have enabled new approaches to Music Information Research (MIR) applications such as audio-to-text and text-to-audio retrieval, text-based song generation, and music captioning. Despite the reported success, little effort has been put into evaluating the musical knowledge of Large Language Models (LLM). In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs suffer from 1) prompt sensitivity, 2) inability to model negation (e.g. 'rock song without guitar'), and 3) sensitivity towards the presence of specific words. We quantified these properties as a triplet-based accuracy, evaluating the ability to model the relative similarity of labels in a hierarchical ontology. We leveraged the Audioset ontology to generate triplets consisting of an anchor, a positive (relevant) label, and a negative (less relevant) label for the genre and instruments sub-tree. We evaluated the triplet-based musical knowledge for six general-purpose Transformer-based models. The triplets obtained through this methodology required filtering, as some were difficult to judge and therefore relatively uninformative for evaluation purposes. Despite the relatively high accuracy reported, inconsistencies are evident in all six models, suggesting that off-the-shelf LLMs need adaptation to music before use.</description>

      <title>Super Resolution On Global Weather Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is a vitally important tool for tasks ranging from planning day to day activities to disaster response planning. However, modeling weather has proven to be challenging task due to its chaotic and unpredictable nature. Each variable, from temperature to precipitation to wind, all influence the path the environment will take. As a result, all models tend to rapidly lose accuracy as the temporal range of their forecasts increase. Classical forecasting methods use a myriad of physics-based, numerical, and stochastic techniques to predict the change in weather variables over time. However, such forecasts often require a very large amount of data and are extremely computationally expensive. Furthermore, as climate and global weather patterns change, classical models are substantially more difficult and time-consuming to update for changing environments. Fortunately, with recent advances in deep learning and publicly available high quality weather datasets, deploying learning methods for estimating these complex systems has become feasible. The current state-of-the-art deep learning models have comparable accuracy to the industry standard numerical models and are becoming more ubiquitous in practice due to their adaptability. Our group seeks to improve upon existing deep learning based forecasting methods by increasing spatial resolutions of global weather predictions. Specifically, we are interested in performing super resolution (SR) on GraphCast temperature predictions by increasing the global precision from 1 degree of accuracy to 0.5 degrees, which is approximately 111km and 55km respectively.</description>

      <title>Preventing Representational Rank Collapse in MPNNs by Splitting the Computational Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to fit complex functions over graphs is limited each iteration of message-passing over a simple makes representations more similar, a phenomenon known as rank collapse, and over-smoothing as a special case. Most approaches to mitigate over-smoothing extend common message-passing schemes, e.g., the graph convolutional network, by utilizing residual connections, gating mechanisms, normalization, or regularization techniques. Our work contrarily proposes to directly tackle the cause of this issue by modifying the message-passing scheme and exchanging different types of messages using multi-relational graphs. We identify the necessary and sufficient condition to ensure linearly independent node representations. As one instantion, we show that operating on multiple directed acyclic graphs always satisfies our condition and propose to obtain these by defining a strict partial ordering of the nodes. We conduct comprehensive experiments that confirm the benefits of operating on multi-relational graphs to achieve more informative node representations.</description>

      <title>Chess Rating Estimation from Moves and Clock Times Using a CNN-LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current rating systems update ratings incrementally and may not always accurately reflect a player's true strength at all times, especially for rapidly improving players or very rusty players. To overcome this, we explore a method to estimate player ratings directly from game moves and clock times. We compiled a benchmark dataset from Lichess, encompassing various time controls and including move sequences and clock times. Our model architecture comprises a CNN to learn positional features, which are then integrated with clock-time data into a bidirectional LSTM, predicting player ratings after each move. The model achieved an MAE of 182 rating points in the test data. Additionally, we applied our model to the 2024 IEEE Big Data Cup Chess Puzzle Difficulty Competition dataset, predicted puzzle ratings and achieved competitive results. This model is the first to use no hand-crafted features to estimate chess ratings and also the first to output a rating prediction for each move. Our method highlights the potential of using move-based rating estimation for enhancing rating systems and potentially other applications such as cheating detection.</description>

      <title>FedNE: Surrogate-Assisted Federated Neighbor Embedding for Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has rapidly evolved as a promising paradigm that enables collaborative model training across distributed participants without exchanging their local data. Despite its broad applications in fields such as computer vision, graph learning, and natural language processing, the development of a data projection model that can be effectively used to visualize data in the context of FL is crucial yet remains heavily under-explored. Neighbor embedding (NE) is an essential technique for visualizing complex high-dimensional data, but collaboratively learning a joint NE model is difficult. The key challenge lies in the objective function, as effective visualization algorithms like NE require computing loss functions among pairs of data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{FedNE}, a novel approach that integrates the \textsc{FedAvg} framework with the contrastive NE technique, without any requirements of shareable data. To address the lack of inter-client repulsion which is crucial for the alignment in the global embedding space, we develop a surrogate loss function that each client learns and shares with each other. Additionally, we propose a data-mixing strategy to augment the local data, aiming to relax the problems of invisible neighbors and false neighbors constructed by the local $k$NN graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our \textsc{FedNE} can effectively preserve the neighborhood data structures and enhance the alignment in the global embedding space compared to several baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Partially Observable Contextual Bandits with Linear Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard contextual bandit framework assumes fully observable and actionable contexts. In this work, we consider a new bandit setting with partially observable, correlated contexts and linear payoffs, motivated by the applications in finance where decision making is based on market information that typically displays temporal correlation and is not fully observed. We make the following contributions marrying ideas from statistical signal processing with bandits: (i) We propose an algorithmic pipeline named EMKF-Bandit, which integrates system identification, filtering, and classic contextual bandit algorithms into an iterative method alternating between latent parameter estimation and decision making. (ii) We analyze EMKF-Bandit when we select Thompson sampling as the bandit algorithm and show that it incurs a sub-linear regret under conditions on filtering. (iii) We conduct numerical simulations that demonstrate the benefits and practical applicability of the proposed pipeline.</description>

      <title>Unlocking NACE Classification Embeddings with OpenAI for Enhanced Analysis and Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) is the standard classification system for the categorization of economic and industrial activities within the European Union. This paper proposes a novel approach to transform the NACE classification into low-dimensional embeddings, using state-of-the-art models and dimensionality reduction techniques. The primary challenge is the preservation of the hierarchical structure inherent within the original NACE classification while reducing the number of dimensions. To address this issue, we introduce custom metrics designed to quantify the retention of hierarchical relationships throughout the embedding and reduction processes. The evaluation of these metrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in retaining the structural information essential for insightful analysis. This approach not only facilitates the visual exploration of economic activity relationships, but also increases the efficacy of downstream tasks, including clustering, classification, integration with other classifications, and others. Through experimental validation, the utility of our proposed framework in preserving hierarchical structures within the NACE classification is showcased, thereby providing a valuable tool for researchers and policymakers to understand and leverage any hierarchical data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Network Flows with Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions and Deep Unrolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.</description>

      <title>Balancing Optimality and Diversity: Human-Centered Decision Making through Generative Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in data availability has inundated decision-makers with an overwhelming array of choices. While existing approaches focus on optimizing decisions based on quantifiable metrics, practical decision-making often requires balancing measurable quantitative criteria with unmeasurable qualitative factors embedded in the broader context. In such cases, algorithms can generate high-quality recommendations, but the final decision rests with the human, who must weigh both dimensions. We define the process of selecting the optimal set of algorithmic recommendations in this context as human-centered decision making. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework called generative curation, which optimizes the true desirability of decision options by integrating both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Our framework uses a Gaussian process to model unknown qualitative factors and derives a diversity metric that balances quantitative optimality with qualitative diversity. This trade-off enables the generation of a manageable subset of diverse, near-optimal actions that are robust to unknown qualitative preferences. To operationalize this framework, we propose two implementation approaches: a generative neural network architecture that produces a distribution $\pi$ to efficiently sample a diverse set of near-optimal actions, and a sequential optimization method to iteratively generates solutions that can be easily incorporated into complex optimization formulations. We validate our approach with extensive datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing decision-making processes across a range of complex environments, with significant implications for policy and management.</description>

      <title>A Property Encoder for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph machine learning, particularly using graph neural networks, fundamentally relies on node features. Nevertheless, numerous real-world systems, such as social and biological networks, often lack node features due to various reasons, including privacy concerns, incomplete or missing data, and limitations in data collection. In such scenarios, researchers typically resort to methods like structural and positional encoding to construct node features. However, the length of such features is contingent on the maximum value within the property being encoded, for example, the highest node degree, which can be exceedingly large in applications like scale-free networks. Furthermore, these encoding schemes are limited to categorical data and might not be able to encode metrics returning other type of values. In this paper, we introduce a novel, universally applicable encoder, termed PropEnc, which constructs expressive node embedding from any given graph metric. PropEnc leverages histogram construction combined with reverse index encoding, offering a flexible method for node features initialization. It supports flexible encoding in terms of both dimensionality and type of input, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse applications. PropEnc allows encoding metrics in low-dimensional space which effectively avoids the issue of sparsity and enhances the efficiency of the models. We show that \emph{PropEnc} can construct node features that either exactly replicate one-hot encoding or closely approximate indices under various settings. Our extensive evaluations in graph classification setting across multiple social networks that lack node features support our hypothesis. The empirical results conclusively demonstrate that PropEnc is both an efficient and effective mechanism for constructing node features from diverse set of graph metrics.</description>

      <title>Advances in APPFL: A Comprehensive and Extensible Federated Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. In today's landscape, where most data is proprietary, confidential, and distributed, FL has become a promising approach to leverage such data effectively, particularly in sensitive domains such as medicine and the electric grid. Heterogeneity and security are the key challenges in FL, however; most existing FL frameworks either fail to address these challenges adequately or lack the flexibility to incorporate new solutions. To this end, we present the recent advances in developing APPFL, an extensible framework and benchmarking suite for federated learning, which offers comprehensive solutions for heterogeneity and security concerns, as well as user-friendly interfaces for integrating new algorithms or adapting to new applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of APPFL through extensive experiments evaluating various aspects of FL, including communication efficiency, privacy preservation, computational performance, and resource utilization. We further highlight the extensibility of APPFL through case studies in vertical, hierarchical, and decentralized FL. APPFL is open-sourced at https://github.com/APPFL/APPFL.</description>

      <title>Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm is a recent, purely forward-mode learning method, that updates weights locally and layer-wise and supports supervised as well as unsupervised learning. These features make it ideal for applications such as brain-inspired learning, low-power hardware neural networks, and distributed learning in large models. However, while FF has shown promise on written digit recognition tasks, its performance on natural images and time-series remains a challenge. A key limitation is the need to generate high-quality negative examples for contrastive learning, especially in unsupervised tasks, where versatile solutions are currently lacking. To address this, we introduce the Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward (SCFF) method, inspired by self-supervised contrastive learning. SCFF generates positive and negative examples applicable across different datasets, surpassing existing local forward algorithms for unsupervised classification accuracy on MNIST (MLP: 98.7%), CIFAR-10 (CNN: 80.75%), and STL-10 (CNN: 77.3%). Additionally, SCFF is the first to enable FF training of recurrent neural networks, opening the door to more complex tasks and continuous-time video and text processing.</description>

      <title>No Saved Kaleidosope: an 100% Jitted Neural Network Coding Language with Pythonic Syntax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a jitted compiler for training Artificial Neural Networks using C++, LLVM and Cuda. It features object-oriented characteristics, strong typing, parallel workers for data pre-processing, pythonic syntax for expressions, PyTorch like model declaration and Automatic Differentiation. We implement the mechanisms of cache and pooling in order to manage VRAM, cuBLAS for high performance matrix multiplication and cuDNN for convolutional layers. Our experiments with Residual Convolutional Neural Networks on ImageNet, we reach similar speed but degraded performance. Also, the GRU network experiments show similar accuracy, but our compiler have degraded speed in that task. However, our compiler demonstrates promising results at the CIFAR-10 benchmark, in which we reach the same performance and about the same speed as PyTorch. We make the code publicly available at: https://github.com/NoSavedDATA/NoSavedKaleidoscope</description>

      <title>Time-Series Forecasting, Knowledge Distillation, and Refinement within a Multimodal PDE Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic encoding has been used in multi-operator learning as a way to embed additional information for distinct time-series data. For spatiotemporal systems described by time-dependent partial differential equations, the equation itself provides an additional modality to identify the system. The utilization of symbolic expressions along side time-series samples allows for the development of multimodal predictive neural networks. A key challenge with current approaches is that the symbolic information, i.e. the equations, must be manually preprocessed (simplified, rearranged, etc.) to match and relate to the existing token library, which increases costs and reduces flexibility, especially when dealing with new differential equations. We propose a new token library based on SymPy to encode differential equations as an additional modality for time-series models. The proposed approach incurs minimal cost, is automated, and maintains high prediction accuracy for forecasting tasks. Additionally, we include a Bayesian filtering module that connects the different modalities to refine the learned equation. This improves the accuracy of the learned symbolic representation and the predicted time-series.</description>

      <title>PieClam: A Universal Graph Autoencoder Based on Overlapping Inclusive and Exclusive Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose PieClam (Prior Inclusive Exclusive Cluster Affiliation Model): a probabilistic graph model for representing any graph as overlapping generalized communities. Our method can be interpreted as a graph autoencoder: nodes are embedded into a code space by an algorithm that maximizes the log-likelihood of the decoded graph, given the input graph. PieClam is a community affiliation model that extends well-known methods like BigClam in two main manners. First, instead of the decoder being defined via pairwise interactions between the nodes in the code space, we also incorporate a learned prior on the distribution of nodes in the code space, turning our method into a graph generative model. Secondly, we generalize the notion of communities by allowing not only sets of nodes with strong connectivity, which we call inclusive communities, but also sets of nodes with strong disconnection, which we call exclusive communities. To model both types of communities, we propose a new type of decoder based the Lorentz inner product, which we prove to be much more expressive than standard decoders based on standard inner products or norm distances. By introducing a new graph similarity measure, that we call the log cut distance, we show that PieClam is a universal autoencoder, able to uniformly approximately reconstruct any graph. Our method is shown to obtain competitive performance in graph anomaly detection benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution, particularly particulate matter (PM2.5), poses significant risks to public health and the environment, necessitating accurate prediction and continuous monitoring for effective air quality management. However, air quality monitoring (AQM) data often suffer from missing records due to various technical difficulties. This study explores the application of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) for imputing missing PM2.5 data by predicting, using training data from 2016, and comparing its performance with the established Soft Impute (SI) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) methods.</description>

      <title>Art and Science of Quantizing Large-Scale Models: A Comprehensive Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, challenges, and methodologies associated with quantizing large-scale neural network models. As neural networks have evolved towards larger and more complex architectures to address increasingly sophisticated tasks, the computational and energy costs have escalated significantly. We explore the necessity and impact of model size growth, highlighting the performance benefits as well as the computational challenges and environmental considerations. The core focus is on model quantization as a fundamental approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing model size and improving efficiency without substantially compromising accuracy. We delve into various quantization techniques, including both post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT), and analyze several state-of-the-art algorithms such as LLM-QAT, PEQA(L4Q), ZeroQuant, SmoothQuant, and others. Through comparative analysis, we examine how these methods address issues like outliers, importance weighting, and activation quantization, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and accessible deployment of large-scale models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Semi-Supervised Learning via Representative and Diverse Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a preferred paradigm in many deep learning tasks, which reduces the need for human labor. Previous studies primarily focus on effectively utilising the labelled and unlabeled data to improve performance. However, we observe that how to select samples for labelling also significantly impacts performance, particularly under extremely low-budget settings. The sample selection task in SSL has been under-explored for a long time. To fill in this gap, we propose a Representative and Diverse Sample Selection approach (RDSS). By adopting a modified Frank-Wolfe algorithm to minimise a novel criterion $\alpha$-Maximum Mean Discrepancy ($\alpha$-MMD), RDSS samples a representative and diverse subset for annotation from the unlabeled data. We demonstrate that minimizing $\alpha$-MMD enhances the generalization ability of low-budget learning. Experimental results show that RDSS consistently improves the performance of several popular SSL frameworks and outperforms the state-of-the-art sample selection approaches used in Active Learning (AL) and Semi-Supervised Active Learning (SSAL), even with constrained annotation budgets.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning with Non-IID Decentralized Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning is crucial for developing scalable and adaptive intelligent systems, as it enables models to acquire new classes with minimal annotated data while safeguarding the previously accumulated knowledge. Nonetheless, existing methods deal with continuous data streams in a centralized manner, limiting their applicability in scenarios that prioritize data privacy and security. To this end, this paper introduces federated few-shot class-incremental learning, a decentralized machine learning paradigm tailored to progressively learn new classes from scarce data distributed across multiple clients. In this learning paradigm, clients locally update their models with new classes while preserving data privacy, and then transmit the model updates to a central server where they are aggregated globally. However, this paradigm faces several issues, such as difficulties in few-shot learning, catastrophic forgetting, and data heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we present a synthetic data-driven framework that leverages replay buffer data to maintain existing knowledge and facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge. Within this framework, a noise-aware generative replay module is developed to fine-tune local models with a balance of new and replay data, while generating synthetic data of new classes to further expand the replay buffer for future tasks. Furthermore, a class-specific weighted aggregation strategy is designed to tackle data heterogeneity by adaptively aggregating class-specific parameters based on local models performance on synthetic data. This enables effective global model optimization without direct access to client data. Comprehensive experiments across three widely-used datasets underscore the effectiveness and preeminence of the introduced framework.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Interpolants for Probabilistic Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential models such as recurrent neural networks or transformer-based models became \textit{de facto} tools for multivariate time series forecasting in a probabilistic fashion, with applications to a wide range of datasets, such as finance, biology, medicine, etc. Despite their adeptness in capturing dependencies, assessing prediction uncertainty, and efficiency in training, challenges emerge in modeling high-dimensional complex distributions and cross-feature dependencies. To tackle these issues, recent works delve into generative modeling by employing diffusion or flow-based models. Notably, the integration of stochastic differential equations or probability flow successfully extends these methods to probabilistic time series imputation and forecasting. However, scalability issues necessitate a computational-friendly framework for large-scale generative model-based predictions. This work proposes a novel approach by blending the computational efficiency of recurrent neural networks with the high-quality probabilistic modeling of the diffusion model, which addresses challenges and advances generative models' application in time series forecasting. Our method relies on the foundation of stochastic interpolants and the extension to a broader conditional generation framework with additional control features, offering insights for future developments in this dynamic field.</description>

      <title>Monomial Matrix Group Equivariant Neural Functional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural functional networks (NFNs) have recently gained significant attention due to their diverse applications, ranging from predicting network generalization and network editing to classifying implicit neural representation. Previous NFN designs often depend on permutation symmetries in neural networks' weights, which traditionally arise from the unordered arrangement of neurons in hidden layers. However, these designs do not take into account the weight scaling symmetries of $\operatorname{ReLU}$ networks, and the weight sign flipping symmetries of $\operatorname{sin}$ or $\operatorname{tanh}$ networks. In this paper, we extend the study of the group action on the network weights from the group of permutation matrices to the group of monomial matrices by incorporating scaling/sign-flipping symmetries. Particularly, we encode these scaling/sign-flipping symmetries by designing our corresponding equivariant and invariant layers. We name our new family of NFNs the Monomial Matrix Group Equivariant Neural Functional Networks (Monomial-NFN). Because of the expansion of the symmetries, Monomial-NFN has much fewer independent trainable parameters compared to the baseline NFNs in the literature, thus enhancing the model's efficiency. Moreover, for fully connected and convolutional neural networks, we theoretically prove that all groups that leave these networks invariant while acting on their weight spaces are some subgroups of the monomial matrix group. We provide empirical evidences to demonstrate the advantages of our model over existing baselines, achieving competitive performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>HARP: Human-Assisted Regrouping with Permutation Invariant Critic for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning integrates human expertise to accelerate agent learning and provide critical guidance and feedback in complex fields. However, many existing approaches focus on single-agent tasks and require continuous human involvement during the training process, significantly increasing the human workload and limiting scalability. In this paper, we propose HARP (Human-Assisted Regrouping with Permutation Invariant Critic), a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework designed for group-oriented tasks. HARP integrates automatic agent regrouping with strategic human assistance during deployment, enabling and allowing non-experts to offer effective guidance with minimal intervention. During training, agents dynamically adjust their groupings to optimize collaborative task completion. When deployed, they actively seek human assistance and utilize the Permutation Invariant Group Critic to evaluate and refine human-proposed groupings, allowing non-expert users to contribute valuable suggestions. In multiple collaboration scenarios, our approach is able to leverage limited guidance from non-experts and enhance performance.

      <title>NPAT Null-Space Projected Adversarial Training Towards Zero Deterioration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate the susceptibility of neural networks to adversarial attacks, adversarial training has emerged as a prevalent and effective defense strategy. Intrinsically, this countermeasure incurs a trade-off, as it sacrifices the model's accuracy in processing normal samples. To reconcile the trade-off, we pioneer the incorporation of null-space projection into adversarial training and propose two innovative Null-space Projection based Adversarial Training(NPAT) algorithms tackling sample generation and gradient optimization, named Null-space Projected Data Augmentation (NPDA) and Null-space Projected Gradient Descent (NPGD), to search for an overarching optimal solutions, which enhance robustness with almost zero deterioration in generalization performance. Adversarial samples and perturbations are constrained within the null-space of the decision boundary utilizing a closed-form null-space projector, effectively mitigating threat of attack stemming from unreliable features. Subsequently, we conducted experiments on the CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets and reveal that our methodology can seamlessly combine with adversarial training methods and obtain comparable robustness while keeping generalization close to a high-accuracy model.</description>

      <title>Consistent Estimation of a Class of Distances Between Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of estimating the distance between two covariance matrices directly from the data. Particularly, we are interested in the family of distances that can be expressed as sums of traces of functions that are separately applied to each covariance matrix. This family of distances is particularly useful as it takes into consideration the fact that covariance matrices lie in the Riemannian manifold of positive definite matrices, thereby including a variety of commonly used metrics, such as the Euclidean distance, Jeffreys' divergence, and the log-Euclidean distance. Moreover, a statistical analysis of the asymptotic behavior of this class of distance estimators has also been conducted. Specifically, we present a central limit theorem that establishes the asymptotic Gaussianity of these estimators and provides closed form expressions for the corresponding means and variances. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed consistent estimator over conventional plug-in estimators in multivariate analytical contexts. Additionally, the central limit theorem derived in this study provides a robust statistical framework to assess of accuracy of these estimators.</description>

      <title>Constraint Guided AutoEncoders for Joint Optimization of Condition Indicator Estimation and Anomaly Detection in Machine Condition Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of machine condition monitoring is, as the name implies, to monitor the condition of industrial applications. The objective of this monitoring can be mainly split into two problems. A diagnostic problem, where normal data should be distinguished from anomalous data, otherwise called Anomaly Detection (AD), or a prognostic problem, where the aim is to predict the evolution of a Condition Indicator (CI) that reflects the condition of an asset throughout its life time. When considering machine condition monitoring, it is expected that this CI shows a monotonic behavior, as the condition of a machine gradually degrades over time. This work proposes an extension to Constraint Guided AutoEncoders (CGAE), which is a robust AD method, that enables building a single model that can be used for both AD and CI estimation. For the purpose of improved CI estimation the extension incorporates a constraint that enforces the model to have monotonically increasing CI predictions over time. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs similar, or slightly better, than CGAE, with regards to AD, while improving the monotonic behavior of the CI.</description>

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations offer detailed insights into atomic motions but face timescale limitations. Enhanced sampling methods have addressed these challenges but even with machine learning, they often rely on pre-selected expert-based features. In this work, we present the Graph Neural Network-State Predictive Information Bottleneck (GNN-SPIB) framework, which combines graph neural networks and the State Predictive Information Bottleneck to automatically learn low-dimensional representations directly from atomic coordinates. Tested on three benchmark systems, our approach predicts essential structural, thermodynamic and kinetic information for slow processes, demonstrating robustness across diverse systems. The method shows promise for complex systems, enabling effective enhanced sampling without requiring pre-defined reaction coordinates or input features.</description>

      <title>An efficient wavelet-based physics-informed neural networks for singularly perturbed problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models that utilize physics as differential equations to address complex problems, including ones that may involve limited data availability. However, tackling solutions of differential equations with oscillations or singular perturbations and shock-like structures becomes challenging for PINNs. Considering these challenges, we designed an efficient wavelet-based PINNs (W-PINNs) model to solve singularly perturbed differential equations. Here, we represent the solution in wavelet space using a family of smooth-compactly supported wavelets. This framework represents the solution of a differential equation with significantly fewer degrees of freedom while still retaining in capturing, identifying, and analyzing the local structure of complex physical phenomena. The architecture allows the training process to search for a solution within wavelet space, making the process faster and more accurate. The proposed model does not rely on automatic differentiations for derivatives involved in differential equations and does not require any prior information regarding the behavior of the solution, such as the location of abrupt features. Thus, through a strategic fusion of wavelets with PINNs, W-PINNs excel at capturing localized nonlinear information, making them well-suited for problems showing abrupt behavior in certain regions, such as singularly perturbed problems. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed neural network model are demonstrated in various test problems, i.e., highly singularly perturbed nonlinear differential equations, the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN), and Predator-prey interaction models. The proposed design model exhibits impressive comparisons with traditional PINNs and the recently developed wavelet-based PINNs, which use wavelets as an activation function for solving nonlinear differential equations.</description>

      <title>Edge-Based Graph Component Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-structured data naturally occurs in many research fields, such as chemistry and sociology. The relational information contained therein can be leveraged to statistically model graph properties through geometrical deep learning. Graph neural networks employ techniques, such as message-passing layers, to propagate local features through a graph. However, message-passing layers can be computationally expensive when dealing with large and sparse graphs. Graph pooling operators offer the possibility of removing or merging nodes in such graphs, thus lowering computational costs. However, pooling operators that remove nodes cause data loss, and pooling operators that merge nodes are often computationally expensive. We propose a pooling operator that merges nodes so as not to cause data loss but is also conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed pooling operator performs statistically significantly better than edge pool on four popular benchmark datasets while reducing time complexity and the number of trainable parameters by 70.6% on average. Compared to another maximally powerful method named Graph Isomporhic Network, we show that we outperform them on two popular benchmark datasets while reducing the number of learnable parameters on average by 60.9%.</description>

      <title>Tight and Efficient Upper Bound on Spectral Norm of Convolutional Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the spectral norm of the Jacobian matrix, which is related to the convolution operation, has been shown to improve generalization, training stability and robustness in CNNs. Existing methods for computing the norm either tend to overestimate it or their performance may deteriorate quickly with increasing the input and kernel sizes. In this paper, we demonstrate that the tensor version of the spectral norm of a four-dimensional convolution kernel, up to a constant factor, serves as an upper bound for the spectral norm of the Jacobian matrix associated with the convolution operation. This new upper bound is independent of the input image resolution, differentiable and can be efficiently calculated during training. Through experiments, we demonstrate how this new bound can be used to improve the performance of convolutional architectures.</description>

      <title>Location based Probabilistic Load Forecasting of EV Charging Sites: Deep Transfer Learning with Multi-Quantile Temporal Convolutional Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrification of vehicles is a potential way of reducing fossil fuel usage and thus lessening environmental pollution. Electric Vehicles (EVs) of various types for different transport modes (including air, water, and land) are evolving. Moreover, different EV user groups (commuters, commercial or domestic users, drivers) may use different charging infrastructures (public, private, home, and workplace) at various times. Therefore, usage patterns and energy demand are very stochastic. Characterizing and forecasting the charging demand of these diverse EV usage profiles is essential in preventing power outages. Previously developed data-driven load models are limited to specific use cases and locations. None of these models are simultaneously adaptive enough to transfer knowledge of day-ahead forecasting among EV charging sites of diverse locations, trained with limited data, and cost-effective. This article presents a location-based load forecasting of EV charging sites using a deep Multi-Quantile Temporal Convolutional Network (MQ-TCN) to overcome the limitations of earlier models. We conducted our experiments on data from four charging sites, namely Caltech, JPL, Office-1, and NREL, which have diverse EV user types like students, full-time and part-time employees, random visitors, etc. With a Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) score of 93.62\%, our proposed deep MQ-TCN model exhibited a remarkable 28.93\% improvement over the XGBoost model for a day-ahead load forecasting at the JPL charging site. By transferring knowledge with the inductive Transfer Learning (TL) approach, the MQ-TCN model achieved a 96.88\% PICP score for the load forecasting task at the NREL site using only two weeks of data.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in OOD Detection: Problems and Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to detect test samples outside the training category space, which is an essential component in building reliable machine learning systems. Existing reviews on OOD detection primarily focus on method taxonomy, surveying the field by categorizing various approaches. However, many recent works concentrate on non-traditional OOD detection scenarios, such as test-time adaptation, multi-modal data sources and other novel contexts. In this survey, we uniquely review recent advances in OOD detection from the problem scenario perspective for the first time. According to whether the training process is completely controlled, we divide OOD detection methods into training-driven and training-agnostic. Besides, considering the rapid development of pre-trained models, large pre-trained model-based OOD detection is also regarded as an important category and discussed separately. Furthermore, we provide a discussion of the evaluation scenarios, a variety of applications, and several future research directions. We believe this survey with new taxonomy will benefit the proposal of new methods and the expansion of more practical scenarios. A curated list of related papers is provided in the Github repository: \url{https://github.com/shuolucs/Awesome-Out-Of-Distribution-Detection}</description>

      <title>Multi-Grid Graph Neural Networks with Self-Attention for Computational Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancement in finite element methods have become essential in various disciplines, and in particular for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), driving research efforts for improved precision and efficiency. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have found success in CFD by mapping meshes into images, recent attention has turned to leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for direct mesh processing. This paper introduces a novel model merging Self-Attention with Message Passing in GNNs, achieving a 15\% reduction in RMSE on the well known flow past a cylinder benchmark. Furthermore, a dynamic mesh pruning technique based on Self-Attention is proposed, that leads to a robust GNN-based multigrid approach, also reducing RMSE by 15\%. Additionally, a new self-supervised training method based on BERT is presented, resulting in a 25\% RMSE reduction. The paper includes an ablation study and outperforms state-of-the-art models on several challenging datasets, promising advancements similar to those recently achieved in natural language and image processing. Finally, the paper introduces a dataset with meshes larger than existing ones by at least an order of magnitude. Code and Datasets will be released at https://github.com/DonsetPG/multigrid-gnn.</description>

      <title>Less Memory Means smaller GPUs: Backpropagation with Compressed Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-growing scale of deep neural networks (DNNs) has lead to an equally rapid growth in computational resource requirements. Many recent architectures, most prominently Large Language Models, have to be trained using supercomputers with thousands of accelerators, such as GPUs or TPUs. Next to the vast number of floating point operations the memory footprint of DNNs is also exploding. In contrast, GPU architectures are notoriously short on memory. Even comparatively small architectures like some EfficientNet variants cannot be trained on a single consumer-grade GPU at reasonable mini-batch sizes. During training, intermediate input activations have to be stored until backpropagation for gradient calculation. These make up the vast majority of the memory footprint. In this work we therefore consider compressing activation maps for the backward pass using pooling, which can reduce both the memory footprint and amount of data movement. The forward computation remains uncompressed. We empirically show convergence and study effects on feature detection at the example of the common vision architecture ResNet. With this approach we are able to reduce the peak memory consumption by 29% at the cost of a longer training schedule, while maintaining prediction accuracy compared to an uncompressed baseline.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Machine Learning Approach to Traffic Accident Fatality Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road traffic accidents (RTA) pose a significant public health threat worldwide, leading to considerable loss of life and economic burdens. This is particularly acute in developing countries like Bangladesh. Building reliable models to forecast crash outcomes is crucial for implementing effective preventive measures. To aid in developing targeted safety interventions, this study presents a machine learning-based approach for classifying fatal and non-fatal road accident outcomes using data from the Dhaka metropolitan traffic crash database from 2017 to 2022. Our framework utilizes a range of machine learning classification algorithms, comprising Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, and Artificial Neural Network. We prioritize model interpretability by employing the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method, which elucidates the key factors influencing accident fatality. Our results demonstrate that LightGBM outperforms other models, achieving a ROC-AUC score of 0.72. The global, local, and feature dependency analyses are conducted to acquire deeper insights into the behavior of the model. SHAP analysis reveals that casualty class, time of accident, location, vehicle type, and road type play pivotal roles in determining fatality risk. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and road safety practitioners in developing countries, enabling the implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce traffic crash fatalities.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning as an Improvement Heuristic for Real-World Production Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with heuristic methods is an emerging trend for solving optimization problems, which leverages RL's ability to learn from the data generated during the search process. One promising approach is to train an RL agent as an improvement heuristic, starting with a suboptimal solution that is iteratively improved by applying small changes. We apply this approach to a real-world multiobjective production scheduling problem. Our approach utilizes a network architecture that includes Transformer encoding to learn the relationships between jobs. Afterwards, a probability matrix is generated from which pairs of jobs are sampled and then swapped to improve the solution. We benchmarked our approach against other heuristics using real data from our industry partner, demonstrating its superior performance.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Model-Agnostic Approach for Uncertainty Estimation in Data-Restricted Pedometric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach designed to enhance uncertainty estimation in the predictive modeling of soil properties, a crucial factor for advancing pedometrics and the practice of digital soil mapping. For addressing the typical challenge of data scarcity in soil studies, we present an improved technique for uncertainty estimation. This method is based on the transformation of regression tasks into classification problems, which not only allows for the production of reliable uncertainty estimates but also enables the application of established machine learning algorithms with competitive performance that have not yet been utilized in pedometrics. Empirical results from datasets collected from two German agricultural fields showcase the practical application of the proposed methodology. Our results and findings suggest that the proposed approach has the potential to provide better uncertainty estimation than the models commonly used in pedometrics.</description>

Abstract: The loss landscape of neural networks is a critical aspect of their training, and understanding its properties is essential for improving their performance. In this paper, we investigate how the loss surface changes when the sample size increases, a previously unexplored issue. We theoretically analyze the convergence of the loss landscape in a fully connected neural network and derive upper bounds for the difference in loss function values when adding a new object to the sample. Our empirical study confirms these results on various datasets, demonstrating the convergence of the loss function surface for image classification tasks. Our findings provide insights into the local geometry of neural loss landscapes and have implications for the development of sample size determination techniques.</description>

      <title>Putting Data at the Centre of Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is an exciting direction of research that uses static datasets to find optimal control policies for multi-agent systems. Though the field is by definition data-driven, efforts have thus far neglected data in their drive to achieve state-of-the-art results. We first substantiate this claim by surveying the literature, showing how the majority of works generate their own datasets without consistent methodology and provide sparse information about the characteristics of these datasets. We then show why neglecting the nature of the data is problematic, through salient examples of how tightly algorithmic performance is coupled to the dataset used, necessitating a common foundation for experiments in the field. In response, we take a big step towards improving data usage and data awareness in offline MARL, with three key contributions: (1) a clear guideline for generating novel datasets; (2) a standardisation of over 80 existing datasets, hosted in a publicly available repository, using a consistent storage format and easy-to-use API; and (3) a suite of analysis tools that allow us to understand these datasets better, aiding further development.</description>

      <title>Topological Deep Learning with State-Space Models: A Mamba Approach for Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks based on the message-passing (MP) mechanism are a dominant approach for handling graph-structured data. However, they are inherently limited to modeling only pairwise interactions, making it difficult to explicitly capture the complexity of systems with $n$-body relations. To address this, topological deep learning has emerged as a promising field for studying and modeling higher-order interactions using various topological domains, such as simplicial and cellular complexes. While these new domains provide powerful representations, they introduce new challenges, such as effectively modeling the interactions among higher-order structures through higher-order MP. Meanwhile, structured state-space sequence models have proven to be effective for sequence modeling and have recently been adapted for graph data by encoding the neighborhood of a node as a sequence, thereby avoiding the MP mechanism. In this work, we propose a novel architecture designed to operate with simplicial complexes, utilizing the Mamba state-space model as its backbone. Our approach generates sequences for the nodes based on the neighboring cells, enabling direct communication between all higher-order structures, regardless of their rank. We extensively validate our model, demonstrating that it achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models developed for simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Neural Computation and Learning Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes Hamiltonian Learning, a novel unified framework for learning with neural networks "over time", i.e., from a possibly infinite stream of data, in an online manner, without having access to future information. Existing works focus on the simplified setting in which the stream has a known finite length or is segmented into smaller sequences, leveraging well-established learning strategies from statistical machine learning. In this paper, the problem of learning over time is rethought from scratch, leveraging tools from optimal control theory, which yield a unifying view of the temporal dynamics of neural computations and learning. Hamiltonian Learning is based on differential equations that: (i) can be integrated without the need of external software solvers; (ii) generalize the well-established notion of gradient-based learning in feed-forward and recurrent networks; (iii) open to novel perspectives. The proposed framework is showcased by experimentally proving how it can recover gradient-based learning, comparing it to out-of-the box optimizers, and describing how it is flexible enough to switch from fully-local to partially/non-local computational schemes, possibly distributed over multiple devices, and BackPropagation without storing activations. Hamiltonian Learning is easy to implement and can help researches approach in a principled and innovative manner the problem of learning over time.</description>

      <title>Handling Long-Term Safety and Uncertainty in Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety is one of the key issues preventing the deployment of reinforcement learning techniques in real-world robots. While most approaches in the Safe Reinforcement Learning area do not require prior knowledge of constraints and robot kinematics and rely solely on data, it is often difficult to deploy them in complex real-world settings. Instead, model-based approaches that incorporate prior knowledge of the constraints and dynamics into the learning framework have proven capable of deploying the learning algorithm directly on the real robot. Unfortunately, while an approximated model of the robot dynamics is often available, the safety constraints are task-specific and hard to obtain: they may be too complicated to encode analytically, too expensive to compute, or it may be difficult to envision a priori the long-term safety requirements. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the safe exploration method, ATACOM, with learnable constraints, with a particular focus on ensuring long-term safety and handling of uncertainty. Our approach is competitive or superior to state-of-the-art methods in final performance while maintaining safer behavior during training.</description>

      <title>Extended Deep Submodular Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel category of set functions called Extended Deep Submodular functions (EDSFs), which are neural network-representable. EDSFs serve as an extension of Deep Submodular Functions (DSFs), inheriting crucial properties from DSFs while addressing innate limitations. It is known that DSFs can represent a limiting subset of submodular functions. In contrast, through an analysis of polymatroid properties, we establish that EDSFs possess the capability to represent all monotone submodular functions, a notable enhancement compared to DSFs. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that EDSFs can represent any monotone set function, indicating the family of EDSFs is equivalent to the family of all monotone set functions. Additionally, we prove that EDSFs maintain the concavity inherent in DSFs when the components of the input vector are non-negative real numbers-an essential feature in certain combinatorial optimization problems. Through extensive experiments, we illustrate that EDSFs exhibit significantly lower empirical generalization error than DSFs in the learning of coverage functions. This suggests that EDSFs present a promising advancement in the representation and learning of set functions with improved generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Via Data Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The removal of carefully-selected examples from training data has recently emerged as an effective way of improving the robustness of machine learning models. However, the best way to select these examples remains an open question. In this paper, we consider the problem from the perspective of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We propose AdaPrune, a method for UDA whereby training examples are removed to attempt to align the training distribution to that of the target data. By adopting the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as the criterion for alignment, the problem can be neatly formulated and solved as an integer quadratic program. We evaluate our approach on a real-world domain shift task of bioacoustic event detection. As a method for UDA, we show that AdaPrune outperforms related techniques, and is complementary to other UDA algorithms such as CORAL. Our analysis of the relationship between the MMD and model accuracy, along with t-SNE plots, validate the proposed method as a principled and well-founded way of performing data pruning.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Prediction: Utilizing Administrative Claims Data with Explainable AI Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of utilizing administrative claims data, combined with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, to predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). We analyze a comprehensive, 10-year dataset provided by a major health insurance organization to develop prediction models for multiple observation windows using traditional machine learning methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost as well as deep learning approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our findings demonstrate that the LSTM model, particularly with a 24-month observation window, exhibits superior performance in predicting ESRD progression, outperforming existing models in the literature. We further apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to enhance interpretability, providing insights into the impact of individual features on predictions at the individual patient level. This study underscores the value of leveraging administrative claims data for CKD management and predicting ESRD progression.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Element Ordering on LM Agent Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in language model agents that can navigate virtual environments such as the web or desktop. To navigate such environments, agents benefit from information on the various elements (e.g., buttons, text, or images) present. It remains unclear which element attributes have the greatest impact on agent performance, especially in environments that only provide a graphical representation (i.e., pixels). Here we find that the ordering in which elements are presented to the language model is surprisingly impactful--randomizing element ordering in a webpage degrades agent performance comparably to removing all visible text from an agent's state representation. While a webpage provides a hierarchical ordering of elements, there is no such ordering when parsing elements directly from pixels. Moreover, as tasks become more challenging and models more sophisticated, our experiments suggest that the impact of ordering increases. Finding an effective ordering is non-trivial. We investigate the impact of various element ordering methods in web and desktop environments. We find that dimensionality reduction provides a viable ordering for pixel-only environments. We train a UI element detection model to derive elements from pixels and apply our findings to an agent benchmark--OmniACT--where we only have access to pixels. Our method completes more than two times as many tasks on average relative to the previous state-of-the-art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a novel framework that integrates higher-order symmetries and category theory into machine learning. We introduce new mathematical constructs, including hyper-symmetry categories and functorial representations, to model complex transformations within learning algorithms. Our contributions include the design of symmetry-enriched learning models, the development of advanced optimization techniques leveraging categorical symmetries, and the theoretical analysis of their implications for model robustness, generalization, and convergence. Through rigorous proofs and practical applications, we demonstrate that incorporating higher-dimensional categorical structures enhances both the theoretical foundations and practical capabilities of modern machine learning algorithms, opening new directions for research and innovation.</description>

      <title>FedLF: Adaptive Logit Adjustment and Feature Optimization in Federated Long-Tailed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning offers a paradigm to the challenge of preserving privacy in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can be globally aggregated, they tend to be long-tailed distributed, which greatly affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated learning primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it fails to address the phenomenon of class-wise bias in global long-tailed data. This results in the trained model focusing on the head classes while neglecting the equally important tail classes. Consequently, it is essential to develop a methodology that considers classes holistically. To address the above problems, we propose a new method FedLF, which introduces three modifications in the local training phase: adaptive logit adjustment, continuous class centred optimization, and feature decorrelation. We compare seven state-of-the-art methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of model performance degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution. our code is available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.</description>

      <title>Pareto Data Framework: Steps Towards Resource-Efficient Decision Making Using Minimum Viable Data (MVD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Pareto Data Framework, an approach for identifying and selecting the Minimum Viable Data (MVD) required for enabling machine learning applications on constrained platforms such as embedded systems, mobile devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We demonstrate that strategic data reduction can maintain high performance while significantly reducing bandwidth, energy, computation, and storage costs. The framework identifies Minimum Viable Data (MVD) to optimize efficiency across resource-constrained environments without sacrificing performance. It addresses common inefficient practices in an IoT application such as overprovisioning of sensors and overprecision, and oversampling of signals, proposing scalable solutions for optimal sensor selection, signal extraction and transmission, and data representation. An experimental methodology demonstrates effective acoustic data characterization after downsampling, quantization, and truncation to simulate reduced-fidelity sensors and network and storage constraints; results shows that performance can be maintained up to 95\% with sample rates reduced by 75\% and bit depths and clip length reduced by 50\% which translates into substantial cost and resource reduction. These findings have implications on the design and development of constrained systems. The paper also discusses broader implications of the framework, including the potential to democratize advanced AI technologies across IoT applications and sectors such as agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing to improve access and multiply the benefits of data-driven insights.</description>

      <title>Stronger Baseline Models -- A Key Requirement for Aligning Machine Learning Research with Clinical Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) research has increased substantially in recent years, due to the success of predictive modeling across diverse application domains. However, well-known barriers exist when attempting to deploy ML models in high-stakes, clinical settings, including lack of model transparency (or the inability to audit the inference process), large training data requirements with siloed data sources, and complicated metrics for measuring model utility. In this work, we show empirically that including stronger baseline models in healthcare ML evaluations has important downstream effects that aid practitioners in addressing these challenges. Through a series of case studies, we find that the common practice of omitting baselines or comparing against a weak baseline model (e.g. a linear model with no optimization) obscures the value of ML methods proposed in the research literature. Using these insights, we propose some best practices that will enable practitioners to more effectively study and deploy ML models in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Almost Sure Convergence of Linear Temporal Difference Learning with Arbitrary Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, abbreviated as linear TD, is a classic and powerful prediction algorithm in reinforcement learning. While it is well understood that linear TD converges almost surely to a unique point, this convergence traditionally requires the assumption that the features used by the approximator are linearly independent. However, this linear independence assumption does not hold in many practical scenarios. This work is the first to establish the almost sure convergence of linear TD without requiring linearly independent features. In fact, we do not make any assumptions on the features. We prove that the approximated value function converges to a unique point and the weight iterates converge to a set. We also establish a notion of local stability of the weight iterates. Importantly, we do not need to introduce any other additional assumptions and do not need to make any modification to the linear TD algorithm. Key to our analysis is a novel characterization of bounded invariant sets of the mean ODE of linear TD.</description>

      <title>LogoRA: Local-Global Representation Alignment for Robust Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) of time series aims to teach models to identify consistent patterns across various temporal scenarios, disregarding domain-specific differences, which can maintain their predictive accuracy and effectively adapt to new domains. However, existing UDA methods struggle to adequately extract and align both global and local features in time series data. To address this issue, we propose the Local-Global Representation Alignment framework (LogoRA), which employs a two-branch encoder, comprising a multi-scale convolutional branch and a patching transformer branch. The encoder enables the extraction of both local and global representations from time series. A fusion module is then introduced to integrate these representations, enhancing domain-invariant feature alignment from multi-scale perspectives. To achieve effective alignment, LogoRA employs strategies like invariant feature learning on the source domain, utilizing triplet loss for fine alignment and dynamic time warping-based feature alignment. Additionally, it reduces source-target domain gaps through adversarial training and per-class prototype alignment. Our evaluations on four time-series datasets demonstrate that LogoRA outperforms strong baselines by up to $12.52\%$, showcasing its superiority in time series UDA tasks.</description>

      <title>Expanding Expressivity in Transformer Models with M\"obiusAttention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms and Transformer architectures have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) by enabling exceptional modeling of long-range dependencies and capturing intricate linguistic patterns. However, their inherent reliance on linear operations in the form of matrix multiplications limits their ability to fully capture inter-token relationships on their own. We propose M\"obiusAttention, a novel approach that integrates M\"obius transformations within the attention mechanism of Transformer-based models. M\"obius transformations are non-linear operations in spaces over complex numbers with the ability to map between various geometries. By incorporating these properties, M\"obiusAttention empowers models to learn more intricate geometric relationships between tokens and capture a wider range of information through complex-valued weight vectors. We build and pre-train a BERT and a RoFormer version enhanced with M\"obiusAttention, which we then finetune on the GLUE benchmark. We evaluate empirically our approach against the baseline BERT and RoFormer models on a range of downstream tasks. Our approach compares favorably against the baseline models, even with smaller number of parameters suggesting the enhanced expressivity of M\"obiusAttention. This research paves the way for exploring the potential of M\"obius transformations in the complex projective space to enhance the expressivity and performance of foundation models.</description>

      <title>Democratizing MLLMs in Healthcare: TinyLLaVA-Med for Efficient Healthcare Diagnostics in Resource-Constrained Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in healthcare is hindered by their high computational demands and significant memory requirements, which are particularly challenging for resource-constrained devices like the Nvidia Jetson Xavier. This problem is particularly evident in remote medical settings where advanced diagnostics are needed but resources are limited. In this paper, we introduce an optimization method for the general-purpose MLLM, TinyLLaVA, which we have adapted and renamed TinyLLaVA-Med. This adaptation involves instruction-tuning and fine-tuning TinyLLaVA on a medical dataset by drawing inspiration from the LLaVA-Med training pipeline. Our approach successfully minimizes computational complexity and power consumption, with TinyLLaVA-Med operating at 18.9W and using 11.9GB of memory, while achieving accuracies of 64.54% on VQA-RAD and 70.70% on SLAKE for closed-ended questions. Therefore, TinyLLaVA-Med achieves deployment viability in hardware-constrained environments with low computational resources, maintaining essential functionalities and delivering accuracies close to state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Understanding when spatial transformer networks do not support invariance, and what to do about it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.11678v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transformer networks (STNs) were designed to enable convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn invariance to image transformations. STNs were originally proposed to transform CNN feature maps as well as input images. This enables the use of more complex features when predicting transformation parameters. However, since STNs perform a purely spatial transformation, they do not, in the general case, have the ability to align the feature maps of a transformed image with those of its original. STNs are therefore unable to support invariance when transforming CNN feature maps. We present a simple proof for this and study the practical implications, showing that this inability is coupled with decreased classification accuracy. We therefore investigate alternative STN architectures that make use of complex features. We find that while deeper localization networks are difficult to train, localization networks that share parameters with the classification network remain stable as they grow deeper, which allows for higher classification accuracy on difficult datasets. Finally, we explore the interaction between localization network complexity and iterative image alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.14759v10 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid approach between scale-space theory and deep learning, where a deep learning architecture is constructed by coupling parameterized scale-space operations in cascade. By sharing the learnt parameters between multiple scale channels, and by using the transformation properties of the scale-space primitives under scaling transformations, the resulting network becomes provably scale covariant. By in addition performing max pooling over the multiple scale channels, a resulting network architecture for image classification also becomes provably scale invariant. We investigate the performance of such networks on the MNISTLargeScale dataset, which contains rescaled images from original MNIST over a factor of 4 concerning training data and over a factor of 16 concerning testing data. It is demonstrated that the resulting approach allows for scale generalization, enabling good performance for classifying patterns at scales not present in the training data.</description>

      <title>CyberNFTs: Conceptualizing a decentralized and reward-driven intrusion detection system with ML</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Internet, particularly the emergence of Web3, has transformed the ways people interact and share data. Web3, although still not well defined, is thought to be a return to the decentralization of corporations' power over user data. Despite the obsolescence of the idea of building systems to detect and prevent cyber intrusions, this is still a topic of interest. This paper proposes a novel conceptual approach for implementing decentralized collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDN) through a proof-of-concept. The study employs an analytical and comparative methodology, examining the synergy between cutting-edge Web3 technologies and information security. The proposed model incorporates blockchain concepts, cyber non-fungible token (cyberNFT) rewards, machine learning algorithms, and publish/subscribe architectures. Finally, the paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the proposed system, offering insights into the potential of decentralized cybersecurity models.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are computational models capable of performing complex natural language processing tasks. Leveraging these capabilities, LLMs hold the potential to transform the entire hardware design stack, with predictions suggesting that front-end and back-end tasks could be fully automated in the near future. Currently, LLMs show great promise in streamlining Register Transfer Level (RTL) generation, enhancing efficiency, and accelerating innovation. However, their probabilistic nature makes them prone to inaccuracies - a significant drawback in RTL design, where reliability and precision are essential.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces AIvril, an advanced framework designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of RTL-aware LLMs. AIvril employs a multi-agent, LLM-agnostic system for automatic syntax correction and functional verification, significantly reducing - and in many cases, completely eliminating - instances of erroneous code generation. Experimental results conducted on the VerilogEval-Human dataset show that our framework improves code quality by nearly 2x when compared to previous works, while achieving an 88.46% success rate in meeting verification objectives. This represents a critical step toward automating and optimizing hardware design workflows, offering a more dependable methodology for AI-driven RTL design.</description>

      <title>Three Pillars Towards Next-Generation Routing System</title>

Abstract: The routing results are playing an increasingly important role in transportation efficiency, but they could generate traffic congestion unintentionally. This is because the traffic condition and routing system are disconnected components in the current routing paradigm. In this paper, we propose a next-generation routing paradigm that could reduce traffic congestion by considering the influence of the routing results in real-time. Specifically, we regard the routing results as the root cause of the future traffic flow, which at the same time is identified as the root cause of traffic conditions. To implement such a system, we identify three essential components: 1) the traffic condition simulation that establishes the relation between traffic flow and traffic condition with guaranteed accuracy; 2) the future route management that supports efficient simulation with dynamic route update; 3) the global routing optimization that improves the overall transportation system efficiency. Preliminary design and experimental results will be presented, and the corresponding challenges and research directions will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Generated Data with Fake Privacy: Hidden Dangers of Fine-tuning Large Language Models on Generated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown considerable success in a range of domain-specific tasks, especially after fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning with real-world data usually leads to privacy risks, particularly when the fine-tuning samples exist in the pre-training data. To avoid the shortcomings of real data, developers often employ methods to automatically generate synthetic data for fine-tuning, as data generated by traditional models are often far away from the real-world pertaining data. However, given the advanced capabilities of LLMs, the distinction between real data and LLM-generated data has become negligible, which may also lead to privacy risks like real data. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of this underexplored issue by investigating a key question: "Does fine-tuning with LLM-generated data enhance privacy, or does it pose additional privacy risks?" Based on the structure of LLM's generated data, our research focuses on two primary approaches to fine-tuning with generated data: supervised fine-tuning with unstructured generated data and self-instruct tuning. The number of successful Personal Information Identifier (PII) extractions for Pythia after fine-tuning our generated data raised over $20\%$. Furthermore, the ROC-AUC score of membership inference attacks for Pythia-6.9b after self-instruct methods also achieves more than $40\%$ improvements on ROC-AUC score than base models. The results indicate the potential privacy risks in LLMs when fine-tuning with the generated data.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the impact of interference in social network algorithms via user-bot interactions, focusing on the Stochastic Bounded Confidence Model (SBCM). This paper explores two approaches: positioning bots controlled by agents into the network and targeted advertising under various circumstances, operating with an advertising budget. This study integrates the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm and its variants to experiment with different Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Finally, experimental results demonstrate that this approach can result in efficient opinion shaping, indicating its potential in deploying advertising resources on social platforms.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Quantum Computing and Fully Homomorphic Encryption: A Novel Computing Paradigm Shift in Privacy-Preserving ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of products powered by machine learning models is raising concerns around data privacy and information security worldwide. To address this issue, Federated Learning was first proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional methods that allow multiple learning clients to share model knowledge without disclosing private data. A complementary approach known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a quantum-safe cryptographic system that enables operations to be performed on encrypted weights. However, implementing mechanisms such as these in practice often comes with significant computational overhead and can expose potential security threats. Novel computing paradigms, such as analog, quantum, and specialized digital hardware, present opportunities for implementing privacy-preserving machine learning systems while enhancing security and mitigating performance loss. This work instantiates these ideas by applying the FHE scheme to a Federated Learning Neural Network architecture that integrates both classical and quantum layers.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Analyzing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Images Generated from Polymer Blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new machine learning workflow with unsupervised learning techniques to identify domains within atomic force microscopy images obtained from polymer films. The goal of the workflow is to identify the spatial location of the two types of polymer domains with little to no manual intervention and calculate the domain size distributions which in turn can help qualify the phase separated state of the material as macrophase or microphase ordered or disordered domains. We briefly review existing approaches used in other fields, computer vision and signal processing that can be applicable for the above tasks that happen frequently in the field of polymer science and engineering. We then test these approaches from computer vision and signal processing on the AFM image dataset to identify the strengths and limitations of each of these approaches for our first task. For our first domain segmentation task, we found that the workflow using discrete Fourier transform or discrete cosine transform with variance statistics as the feature works the best. The popular ResNet50 deep learning approach from computer vision field exhibited relatively poorer performance in the domain segmentation task for our AFM images as compared to the DFT and DCT based workflows. For the second task, for each of 144 input AFM images, we then used an existing porespy python package to calculate the domain size distribution from the output of that image from DFT based workflow. The information and open source codes we share in this paper can serve as a guide for researchers in the polymer and soft materials fields who need ML modeling and workflows for automated analyses of AFM images from polymer samples that may have crystalline or amorphous domains, sharp or rough interfaces between domains, or micro or macrophase separated domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxygenators, alarm devices, and footsteps are some of the most common sound sources in a hospital. Detecting them has scientific value for environmental psychology but comes with challenges of its own: namely, privacy preservation and limited labeled data. In this paper, we address these two challenges via a combination of edge computing and cloud computing. For privacy preservation, we have designed an acoustic sensor which computes third-octave spectrograms on the fly instead of recording audio waveforms. For sample-efficient machine learning, we have repurposed a pretrained audio neural network (PANN) via spectral transcoding and label space adaptation. A small-scale study in a neonatological intensive care unit (NICU) confirms that the time series of detected events align with another modality of measurement: i.e., electronic badges for parents and healthcare professionals. Hence, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of polyphonic machine listening in a hospital ward while guaranteeing privacy by design.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning of Conjugated Visual Representations through Higher-order Motion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning with neural networks from a continuous stream of visual information presents several challenges due to the non-i.i.d. nature of the data. However, it also offers novel opportunities to develop representations that are consistent with the information flow. In this paper we investigate the case of unsupervised continual learning of pixel-wise features subject to multiple motion-induced constraints, therefore named motion-conjugated feature representations. Differently from existing approaches, motion is not a given signal (either ground-truth or estimated by external modules), but is the outcome of a progressive and autonomous learning process, occurring at various levels of the feature hierarchy. Multiple motion flows are estimated with neural networks and characterized by different levels of abstractions, spanning from traditional optical flow to other latent signals originating from higher-level features, hence called higher-order motions. Continuously learning to develop consistent multi-order flows and representations is prone to trivial solutions, which we counteract by introducing a self-supervised contrastive loss, spatially-aware and based on flow-induced similarity. We assess our model on photorealistic synthetic streams and real-world videos, comparing to pre-trained state-of-the art feature extractors (also based on Transformers) and to recent unsupervised learning models, significantly outperforming these alternatives.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection and Identification via Monitoring Modules Based on Clusters of Interacting Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel control-aware distributed process monitoring methodology based on modules comprised of clusters of interacting measurements. The methodology relies on the process flow diagram (PFD) and control system structure without requiring cross-correlation data to create monitoring modules. The methodology is validated on the Tennessee Eastman Process benchmark using full Principal Component Analysis (f-PCA) in the monitoring modules. The results are comparable to nonlinear techniques implemented in a centralized manner such as Kernel PCA (KPCA), Autoencoders (AE), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or distributed techniques like the Distributed Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA). Temporal plots of fault detection by different modules show clearly the magnitude and propagation of the fault through each module, pinpointing the module where the fault originates, and separating controllable faults from other faults. This information, combined with PCA contribution plots, helps detection and identification as effectively as more complex nonlinear centralized or distributed methods.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Symbolic Mathematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI safety have led to increased efforts in training and red-teaming large language models (LLMs) to mitigate unsafe content generation. However, these safety mechanisms may not be comprehensive, leaving potential vulnerabilities unexplored. This paper introduces MathPrompt, a novel jailbreaking technique that exploits LLMs' advanced capabilities in symbolic mathematics to bypass their safety mechanisms. By encoding harmful natural language prompts into mathematical problems, we demonstrate a critical vulnerability in current AI safety measures. Our experiments across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal an average attack success rate of 73.6\%, highlighting the inability of existing safety training mechanisms to generalize to mathematically encoded inputs. Analysis of embedding vectors shows a substantial semantic shift between original and encoded prompts, helping explain the attack's success. This work emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to AI safety, calling for expanded red-teaming efforts to develop robust safeguards across all potential input types and their associated risks.</description>

      <title>Learning a Terrain- and Robot-Aware Dynamics Model for Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile robots should be capable of planning cost-efficient paths for autonomous navigation. Typically, the terrain and robot properties are subject to variations. For instance, properties of the terrain such as friction may vary across different locations. Also, properties of the robot may change such as payloads or wear and tear, e.g., causing changing actuator gains or joint friction. Autonomous navigation approaches should thus be able to adapt to such variations. In this article, we propose a novel approach for learning a probabilistic, terrain- and robot-aware forward dynamics model (TRADYN) which can adapt to such variations and demonstrate its use for navigation. Our learning approach extends recent advances in meta-learning forward dynamics models based on Neural Processes for mobile robot navigation. We evaluate our method in simulation for 2D navigation of a robot with uni-cycle dynamics with varying properties on terrain with spatially varying friction coefficients. In our experiments, we demonstrate that TRADYN has lower prediction error over long time horizons than model ablations which do not adapt to robot or terrain variations. We also evaluate our model for navigation planning in a model-predictive control framework and under various sources of noise. We demonstrate that our approach yields improved performance in planning control-efficient paths by taking robot and terrain properties into account.</description>

Abstract: We propose a minimal power white box adversarial attack for Deep Learning based Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC). The proposed attack uses the Golden Ratio Search (GRS) method to find powerful attacks with minimal power. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method by comparing it with existing adversarial attack approaches. Additionally, we test the robustness of the proposed attack against various state-of-the-art architectures, including defense mechanisms such as adversarial training, binarization, and ensemble methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack is powerful, requires minimal power, and can be generated in less time, significantly challenging the resilience of current AMC methods.</description>

      <title>Two Stage Segmentation of Cervical Tumors using PocketNet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common malignancy amongst women worldwide.1 Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) serves as the mainstay definitive treatment regimen for locally advanced cervical cancers and includes external beam radiation followed by brachytherapy.2 Integral to radiotherapy treatment planning is the routine contouring of both the target tumor at the level of the cervix, associated gynecologic anatomy and the adjacent organs at risk (OARs). However, manual contouring of these structures is both time and labor intensive and associated with known interobserver variability that can impact treatment outcomes. While multiple tools have been developed to automatically segment OARs and the high-risk clinical tumor volume (HR-CTV) using computed tomography (CT) images,3,4,5,6 the development of deep learning-based tumor segmentation tools using routine T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) addresses an unmet clinical need to improve the routine contouring of both anatomical structures and cervical cancers, thereby increasing quality and consistency of radiotherapy planning. This work applied a novel deep-learning model (PocketNet) to segment the cervix, vagina, uterus, and tumor(s) on T2w MRI. The performance of the PocketNet architecture was evaluated, when trained on data via 5-fold cross validation. PocketNet achieved a mean Dice-Sorensen similarity coefficient (DSC) exceeding 70% for tumor segmentation and 80% for organ segmentation. These results suggest that PocketNet is robust to variations in contrast protocols, providing reliable segmentation of the ROIs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Algorithmic Fairness: A Guide to Develop and Deploy Ethical AI-Enabled Decision-Support Tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and optimization hold substantial promise for improving the efficiency, reliability, and resilience of engineered systems. Due to the networked nature of many engineered systems, ethically deploying methodologies at this intersection poses challenges that are distinct from other AI settings, thus motivating the development of ethical guidelines tailored to AI-enabled optimization. This paper highlights the need to go beyond fairness-driven algorithms to systematically address ethical decisions spanning the stages of modeling, data curation, results analysis, and implementation of optimization-based decision support tools. Accordingly, this paper identifies ethical considerations required when deploying algorithms at the intersection of AI and optimization via case studies in power systems as well as supply chain and logistics. Rather than providing a prescriptive set of rules, this paper aims to foster reflection and awareness among researchers and encourage consideration of ethical implications at every step of the decision-making process.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Frequency Estimation in Sliding Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to utilize machine learning approaches to improve sliding window algorithms for approximate frequency estimation problems, under the ``algorithms with predictions'' framework. In this dynamic environment, previous learning-augmented algorithms are less effective, since properties in sliding window resolution can differ significantly from the properties of the entire stream. Our focus is on the benefits of predicting and filtering out items with large next arrival times -- that is, there is a large gap until their next appearance -- from the stream, which we show improves the memory-accuracy tradeoffs significantly. We provide theorems that provide insight into how and by how much our technique can improve the sliding window algorithm, as well as experimental results using real-world data sets. Our work demonstrates that predictors can be useful in the challenging sliding window setting.</description>

      <title>VALO: A Versatile Anytime Framework for LiDAR-based Object Detection Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of adapting dynamic deadline requirements for LiDAR object detection deep neural networks (DNNs). The computing latency of object detection is critically important to ensure safe and efficient navigation. However, state-of-the-art LiDAR object detection DNNs often exhibit significant latency, hindering their real-time performance on resource-constrained edge platforms. Therefore, a tradeoff between detection accuracy and latency should be dynamically managed at runtime to achieve optimum results.
  In this paper, we introduce VALO (Versatile Anytime algorithm for LiDAR Object detection), a novel data-centric approach that enables anytime computing of 3D LiDAR object detection DNNs. VALO employs a deadline-aware scheduler to selectively process input regions, making execution time and accuracy tradeoffs without architectural modifications. Additionally, it leverages efficient forecasting of past detection results to mitigate possible loss of accuracy due to partial processing of input. Finally, it utilizes a novel input reduction technique within its detection heads to significantly accelerate execution without sacrificing accuracy.
  We implement VALO on state-of-the-art 3D LiDAR object detection networks, namely CenterPoint and VoxelNext, and demonstrate its dynamic adaptability to a wide range of time constraints while achieving higher accuracy than the prior state-of-the-art. Code is available athttps://github.com/CSL-KU/VALO}{github.com/CSL-KU/VALO.</description>

      <title>Discrete Unit based Masking for Improving Disentanglement in Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) aims to modify the speaker's identity while preserving the linguistic content. Commonly, VC methods use an encoder-decoder architecture, where disentangling the speaker's identity from linguistic information is crucial. However, the disentanglement approaches used in these methods are limited as the speaker features depend on the phonetic content of the utterance, compromising disentanglement. This dependency is amplified with attention-based methods. To address this, we introduce a novel masking mechanism in the input before speaker encoding, masking certain discrete speech units that correspond highly with phoneme classes. Our work aims to reduce the phonetic dependency of speaker features by restricting access to some phonetic information. Furthermore, since our approach is at the input level, it is applicable to any encoder-decoder based VC framework. Our approach improves disentanglement and conversion performance across multiple VC methods, showing significant effectiveness, particularly in attention-based method, with 44% relative improvement in objective intelligibility.</description>

      <title>Automating proton PBS treatment planning for head and neck cancers using policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) treatment planning for head and neck (H&amp;N) cancers is a time-consuming and experience-demanding task where a large number of planning objectives are involved. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been introduced to the planning processes of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and brachytherapy for prostate, lung, and cervical cancers. However, existing approaches are built upon the Q-learning framework and weighted linear combinations of clinical metrics, suffering from poor scalability and flexibility and only capable of adjusting a limited number of planning objectives in discrete action spaces. We propose an automatic treatment planning model using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and a dose distribution-based reward function for proton PBS treatment planning of H&amp;N cancers. Specifically, a set of empirical rules is used to create auxiliary planning structures from target volumes and organs-at-risk (OARs), along with their associated planning objectives. These planning objectives are fed into an in-house optimization engine to generate the spot monitor unit (MU) values. A decision-making policy network trained using PPO is developed to iteratively adjust the involved planning objective parameters in a continuous action space and refine the PBS treatment plans using a novel dose distribution-based reward function. Proton H&amp;N treatment plans generated by the model show improved OAR sparing with equal or superior target coverage when compared with human-generated plans. Moreover, additional experiments on liver cancer demonstrate that the proposed method can be successfully generalized to other treatment sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DRL-based automatic treatment planning model capable of achieving human-level performance for H&amp;N cancers.</description>

      <title>Outlier Detection with Cluster Catch Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel family of outlier detection algorithms based on Cluster Catch Digraphs (CCDs), specifically tailored to address the challenges of high dimensionality and varying cluster shapes, which deteriorate the performance of most traditional outlier detection methods. We propose the Uniformity-Based CCD with Mutual Catch Graph (U-MCCD), the Uniformity- and Neighbor-Based CCD with Mutual Catch Graph (UN-MCCD), and their shape-adaptive variants (SU-MCCD and SUN-MCCD), which are designed to detect outliers in data sets with arbitrary cluster shapes and high dimensions. We present the advantages and shortcomings of these algorithms and provide the motivation or need to define each particular algorithm. Through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, we assess their performance and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our algorithms across various settings and contamination levels. We also illustrate the use of our algorithms on various real-life data sets. The U-MCCD algorithm efficiently identifies outliers while maintaining high true negative rates, and the SU-MCCD algorithm shows substantial improvement in handling non-uniform clusters. Additionally, the UN-MCCD and SUN-MCCD algorithms address the limitations of existing methods in high-dimensional spaces by utilizing Nearest Neighbor Distances (NND) for clustering and outlier detection. Our results indicate that these novel algorithms offer substantial advancements in the accuracy and adaptability of outlier detection, providing a valuable tool for various real-world applications.

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Smooth Boosting and the Tightness of the Hardcore Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smooth boosters generate distributions that do not place too much weight on any given example. Originally introduced for their noise-tolerant properties, such boosters have also found applications in differential privacy, reproducibility, and quantum learning theory. We study and settle the sample complexity of smooth boosting: we exhibit a class that can be weak learned to $\gamma$-advantage over smooth distributions with $m$ samples, for which strong learning over the uniform distribution requires $\tilde{\Omega}(1/\gamma^2)\cdot m$ samples. This matches the overhead of existing smooth boosters and provides the first separation from the setting of distribution-independent boosting, for which the corresponding overhead is $O(1/\gamma)$.
  Our work also sheds new light on Impagliazzo's hardcore theorem from complexity theory, all known proofs of which can be cast in the framework of smooth boosting. For a function $f$ that is mildly hard against size-$s$ circuits, the hardcore theorem provides a set of inputs on which $f$ is extremely hard against size-$s'$ circuits. A downside of this important result is the loss in circuit size, i.e. that $s' \ll s$. Answering a question of Trevisan, we show that this size loss is necessary and in fact, the parameters achieved by known proofs are the best possible.</description>

      <title>DiffESM: Conditional Emulation of Temperature and Precipitation in Earth System Models with 3D Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth System Models (ESMs) are essential for understanding the interaction between human activities and the Earth's climate. However, the computational demands of ESMs often limit the number of simulations that can be run, hindering the robust analysis of risks associated with extreme weather events. While low-cost climate emulators have emerged as an alternative to emulate ESMs and enable rapid analysis of future climate, many of these emulators only provide output on at most a monthly frequency. This temporal resolution is insufficient for analyzing events that require daily characterization, such as heat waves or heavy precipitation. We propose using diffusion models, a class of generative deep learning models, to effectively downscale ESM output from a monthly to a daily frequency. Trained on a handful of ESM realizations, reflecting a wide range of radiative forcings, our DiffESM model takes monthly mean precipitation or temperature as input, and is capable of producing daily values with statistical characteristics close to ESM output. Combined with a low-cost emulator providing monthly means, this approach requires only a small fraction of the computational resources needed to run a large ensemble. We evaluate model behavior using a number of extreme metrics, showing that DiffESM closely matches the spatio-temporal behavior of the ESM output it emulates in terms of the frequency and spatial characteristics of phenomena such as heat waves, dry spells, or rainfall intensity.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Generalized Category Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify inputs into both known and novel categories, a task crucial for open-world scientific discoveries. However, current GCD methods are limited to unimodal data, overlooking the inherently multimodal nature of most real-world data. In this work, we extend GCD to a multimodal setting, where inputs from different modalities provide richer and complementary information. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we identify that the key challenge in multimodal GCD lies in effectively aligning heterogeneous information across modalities. To address this, we propose MM-GCD, a novel framework that aligns both the feature and output spaces of different modalities using contrastive learning and distillation techniques. MM-GCD achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the UPMC-Food101 and N24News datasets, surpassing previous methods by 11.5\% and 4.7\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>DAF-Net: A Dual-Branch Feature Decomposition Fusion Network with Domain Adaptive for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to combine complementary information from both modalities to provide a more comprehensive scene understanding. However, due to the significant differences between the two modalities, preserving key features during the fusion process remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a dual-branch feature decomposition fusion network (DAF-Net) with domain adaptive, which introduces Multi-Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MK-MMD) into the base encoder and designs a hybrid kernel function suitable for infrared and visible image fusion. The base encoder built on the Restormer network captures global structural information while the detail encoder based on Invertible Neural Networks (INN) focuses on extracting detail texture information. By incorporating MK-MMD, the DAF-Net effectively aligns the latent feature spaces of visible and infrared images, thereby improving the quality of the fused images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques across multiple datasets, significantly enhancing both visual quality and fusion performance. The related Python code is available at https://github.com/xujian000/DAF-Net.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The machine learning problem of extracting neural network parameters has been proposed for nearly three decades. Functionally equivalent extraction is a crucial goal for research on this problem. When the adversary has access to the raw output of neural networks, various attacks, including those presented at CRYPTO 2020 and EUROCRYPT 2024, have successfully achieved this goal. However, this goal is not achieved when neural networks operate under a hard-label setting where the raw output is inaccessible.
  In this paper, we propose the first attack that theoretically achieves functionally equivalent extraction under the hard-label setting, which applies to ReLU neural networks. The effectiveness of our attack is validated through practical experiments on a wide range of ReLU neural networks, including neural networks trained on two real benchmarking datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10) widely used in computer vision. For a neural network consisting of $10^5$ parameters, our attack only requires several hours on a single core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cell is arguably the smallest unit of life and is central to understanding biology. Accurate modeling of cells is important for this understanding as well as for determining the root causes of disease. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), combined with the ability to generate large-scale experimental data, present novel opportunities to model cells. Here we propose a vision of AI-powered Virtual Cells, where robust representations of cells and cellular systems under different conditions are directly learned from growing biological data across measurements and scales. We discuss desired capabilities of AI Virtual Cells, including generating universal representations of biological entities across scales, and facilitating interpretable in silico experiments to predict and understand their behavior using Virtual Instruments. We further address the challenges, opportunities and requirements to realize this vision including data needs, evaluation strategies, and community standards and engagement to ensure biological accuracy and broad utility. We envision a future where AI Virtual Cells help identify new drug targets, predict cellular responses to perturbations, as well as scale hypothesis exploration. With open science collaborations across the biomedical ecosystem that includes academia, philanthropy, and the biopharma and AI industries, a comprehensive predictive understanding of cell mechanisms and interactions is within reach.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-based Motion Generation with Multi-modal Interaction Relational Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate nature of real-world driving environments, characterized by dynamic and diverse interactions among multiple vehicles and their possible future states, presents considerable challenges in accurately predicting the motion states of vehicles and handling the uncertainty inherent in the predictions. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive modeling and reasoning to capture the implicit relations among vehicles and the corresponding diverse behaviors. This research introduces an integrated framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) motion prediction to address these complexities, utilizing a novel Relational Hypergraph Interaction-informed Neural mOtion generator (RHINO). RHINO leverages hypergraph-based relational reasoning by integrating a multi-scale hypergraph neural network to model group-wise interactions among multiple vehicles and their multi-modal driving behaviors, thereby enhancing motion prediction accuracy and reliability. Experimental validation using real-world datasets demonstrates the superior performance of this framework in improving predictive accuracy and fostering socially aware automated driving in dynamic traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced-State Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Multi-Task Fusion in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the last key stage of Recommender Systems (RSs), Multi-Task Fusion (MTF) is in charge of combining multiple scores predicted by Multi-Task Learning (MTL) into a final score to maximize user satisfaction, which decides the ultimate recommendation results. In recent years, to maximize long-term user satisfaction within a recommendation session, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely used for MTF in large-scale RSs. However, limited by their modeling pattern, all the current RL-MTF methods can only utilize user features as the state to generate actions for each user, but unable to make use of item features and other valuable features, which leads to suboptimal results. Addressing this problem is a challenge that requires breaking through the current modeling pattern of RL-MTF. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method called Enhanced-State RL for MTF in RSs. Unlike the existing methods mentioned above, our method first defines user features, item features, and other valuable features collectively as the enhanced state; then proposes a novel actor and critic learning process to utilize the enhanced state to make much better action for each user-item pair. To the best of our knowledge, this novel modeling pattern is being proposed for the first time in the field of RL-MTF. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments in a large-scale RS. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other models significantly. Enhanced-State RL has been fully deployed in our RS more than half a year, improving +3.84% user valid consumption and +0.58% user duration time compared to baseline.</description>

Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including human evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark, exhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links, bold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit these biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval and LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where current preference models favor longer responses that appear more comprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter, competing responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely underexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in preference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a comprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show that with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject significant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also be easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n sampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the format than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the need to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms and evaluating models.</description>

      <title>From exponential to finite/fixed-time stability: Applications to optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of finite/fixed-time stable optimization algorithms typically involves study of specific problem instances. The lack of a unified framework hinders understanding of more sophisticated algorithms, e.g., primal-dual gradient flow dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to address the following question: Given an exponentially stable optimization algorithm, can it be modified to obtain a finite/fixed-time stable algorithm? We provide an affirmative answer, demonstrate how the solution can be computed on a finite-time interval via a simple scaling of the right-hand-side of the original dynamics, and certify the desired properties of the modified algorithm using the Lyapunov function that proves exponential stability of the original system. Finally, we examine nonsmooth composite optimization problems and smooth problems with linear constraints to demonstrate the merits of our approach.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Based Structured Matrices for Efficient Approximately Equivariant Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in designing symmetry-aware neural networks (NNs) exhibiting relaxed equivariance. Such NNs aim to interpolate between being exactly equivariant and being fully flexible, affording consistent performance benefits. In a separate line of work, certain structured parameter matrices -- those with displacement structure, characterized by low displacement rank (LDR) -- have been used to design small-footprint NNs. Displacement structure enables fast function and gradient evaluation, but permits accurate approximations via compression primarily to classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose a general framework -- based on a novel construction of symmetry-based structured matrices -- to build approximately equivariant NNs with significantly reduced parameter counts. Our framework integrates the two aforementioned lines of work via the use of so-called Group Matrices (GMs), a forgotten precursor to the modern notion of regular representations of finite groups. GMs allow the design of structured matrices -- resembling LDR matrices -- which generalize the linear operations of a classical CNN from cyclic groups to general finite groups and their homogeneous spaces. We show that GMs can be employed to extend all the elementary operations of CNNs to general discrete groups. Further, the theory of structured matrices based on GMs provides a generalization of LDR theory focussed on matrices with cyclic structure, providing a tool for implementing approximate equivariance for discrete groups. We test GM-based architectures on a variety of tasks in the presence of relaxed symmetry. We report that our framework consistently performs competitively compared to approximately equivariant NNs, and other structured matrix-based compression frameworks, sometimes with a one or two orders of magnitude lower parameter count.</description>

      <title>The Factuality of Large Language Models in the Legal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the factuality of large language models (LLMs) as knowledge bases in the legal domain, in a realistic usage scenario: we allow for acceptable variations in the answer, and let the model abstain from answering when uncertain. First, we design a dataset of diverse factual questions about case law and legislation. We then use the dataset to evaluate several LLMs under different evaluation methods, including exact, alias, and fuzzy matching. Our results show that the performance improves significantly under the alias and fuzzy matching methods. Further, we explore the impact of abstaining and in-context examples, finding that both strategies enhance precision. Finally, we demonstrate that additional pre-training on legal documents, as seen with SaulLM, further improves factual precision from 63% to 81%.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Training and Improving the Reliability of Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Strongly Anharmonic Materials through Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) employing machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) serve as an efficient, urgently needed complement to ab initio molecular dynamics (aiMD). By training these potentials on data generated from ab initio methods, their averaged predictions can exhibit comparable performance to ab initio methods at a fraction of the cost. However, insufficient training sets might lead to an improper description of the dynamics in strongly anharmonic materials, because critical effects might be overlooked in relevant cases, or only incorrectly captured, or hallucinated by the MLIP when they are not actually present. In this work, we show that an active learning scheme that combines MD with MLIPs (MLIP-MD) and uncertainty estimates can avoid such problematic predictions. In short, efficient MLIP-MD is used to explore configuration space quickly, whereby an acquisition function based on uncertainty estimates and on energetic viability is employed to maximize the value of the newly generated data and to focus on the most unfamiliar but reasonably accessible regions of phase space. To verify our methodology, we screen over 112 materials and identify 10 examples experiencing the aforementioned problems. Using CuI and AgGaSe$_2$ as archetypes for these problematic materials, we discuss the physical implications for strongly anharmonic effects and demonstrate how the developed active learning scheme can address these issues.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Job Shop Scheduling in the Furniture Industry: A Reinforcement Learning Approach Considering Machine Setup, Batch Variability, and Intralogistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential application of Deep Reinforcement Learning in the furniture industry. To offer a broad product portfolio, most furniture manufacturers are organized as a job shop, which ultimately results in the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). The JSSP is addressed with a focus on extending traditional models to better represent the complexities of real-world production environments. Existing approaches frequently fail to consider critical factors such as machine setup times or varying batch sizes. A concept for a model is proposed that provides a higher level of information detail to enhance scheduling accuracy and efficiency. The concept introduces the integration of DRL for production planning, particularly suited to batch production industries such as the furniture industry. The model extends traditional approaches to JSSPs by including job volumes, buffer management, transportation times, and machine setup times. This enables more precise forecasting and analysis of production flows and processes, accommodating the variability and complexity inherent in real-world manufacturing processes. The RL agent learns to optimize scheduling decisions. It operates within a discrete action space, making decisions based on detailed observations. A reward function guides the agent's decision-making process, thereby promoting efficient scheduling and meeting production deadlines. Two integration strategies for implementing the RL agent are discussed: episodic planning, which is suitable for low-automation environments, and continuous planning, which is ideal for highly automated plants. While episodic planning can be employed as a standalone solution, the continuous planning approach necessitates the integration of the agent with ERP and Manufacturing Execution Systems. This integration enables real-time adjustments to production schedules based on dynamic changes.</description>

      <title>RaggeDi: Diffusion-based State Estimation of Disordered Rags, Sheets, Towels and Blankets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloth state estimation is an important problem in robotics. It is essential for the robot to know the accurate state to manipulate cloth and execute tasks such as robotic dressing, stitching, and covering/uncovering human beings. However, estimating cloth state accurately remains challenging due to its high flexibility and self-occlusion. This paper proposes a diffusion model-based pipeline that formulates the cloth state estimation as an image generation problem by representing the cloth state as an RGB image that describes the point-wise translation (translation map) between a pre-defined flattened mesh and the deformed mesh in a canonical space. Then we train a conditional diffusion-based image generation model to predict the translation map based on an observation. Experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate the performance of our method. Results indicate that our method outperforms two recent methods in both accuracy and speed.</description>

      <title>Secure Control Systems for Autonomous Quadrotors against Cyber-Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of safety for robotic systems has been extensively studied. However, little attention has been given to security issues for three-dimensional systems, such as quadrotors. Malicious adversaries can compromise robot sensors and communication networks, causing incidents, achieving illegal objectives, or even injuring people. This study first designs an intelligent control system for autonomous quadrotors. Then, it investigates the problems of optimal false data injection attack scheduling and countermeasure design for unmanned aerial vehicles. Using a state-of-the-art deep learning-based approach, an optimal false data injection attack scheme is proposed to deteriorate a quadrotor's tracking performance with limited attack energy. Subsequently, an optimal tracking control strategy is learned to mitigate attacks and recover the quadrotor's tracking performance. We base our work on Agilicious, a state-of-the-art quadrotor recently deployed for autonomous settings. This paper is the first in the United Kingdom to deploy this quadrotor and implement reinforcement learning on its platform. Therefore, to promote easy reproducibility with minimal engineering overhead, we further provide (1) a comprehensive breakdown of this quadrotor, including software stacks and hardware alternatives; (2) a detailed reinforcement-learning framework to train autonomous controllers on Agilicious agents; and (3) a new open-source environment that builds upon PyFlyt for future reinforcement learning research on Agilicious platforms. Both simulated and real-world experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks in section 5.2.</description>

      <title>Generation of Complex 3D Human Motion by Temporal and Spatial Composition of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of generating realistic 3D human motions for action classes that were never seen during the training phase. Our approach involves decomposing complex actions into simpler movements, specifically those observed during training, by leveraging the knowledge of human motion contained in GPTs models. These simpler movements are then combined into a single, realistic animation using the properties of diffusion models. Our claim is that this decomposition and subsequent recombination of simple movements can synthesize an animation that accurately represents the complex input action. This method operates during the inference phase and can be integrated with any pre-trained diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of motion classes not present in the training data. We evaluate our method by dividing two benchmark human motion datasets into basic and complex actions, and then compare its performance against the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handling orientations of robots and objects is a crucial aspect of many applications. Yet, ever so often, there is a lack of mathematical correctness when dealing with orientations, especially in learning pipelines involving, for example, artificial neural networks. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning with orientations and propose a simple modification of the network's input and output that adheres to the Lie group structure of orientations. As a result, we obtain an easy and efficient implementation that is directly usable with existing learning libraries and achieves significantly better performance than other common orientation representations. We briefly introduce Lie theory specifically for orientations in robotics to motivate and outline our approach. Subsequently, a thorough empirical evaluation of different combinations of orientation representations for states and actions demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach in different scenarios, including: direct orientation control, end effector orientation control, and pick-and-place tasks.</description>

Abstract: In this technical report, we describe the SNTL-NTU team's submission for Task 1 Data-Efficient Low-Complexity Acoustic Scene Classification of the detection and classification of acoustic scenes and events (DCASE) 2024 challenge. Three systems are introduced to tackle training splits of different sizes. For small training splits, we explored reducing the complexity of the provided baseline model by reducing the number of base channels. We introduce data augmentation in the form of mixup to increase the diversity of training samples. For the larger training splits, we use FocusNet to provide confusing class information to an ensemble of multiple Patchout faSt Spectrogram Transformer (PaSST) models and baseline models trained on the original sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. We use Knowledge Distillation to distill the ensemble model to the baseline student model. Training the systems on the TAU Urban Acoustic Scene 2022 Mobile development dataset yielded the highest average testing accuracy of (62.21, 59.82, 56.81, 53.03, 47.97)% on split (100, 50, 25, 10, 5)% respectively over the three systems.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of Synthetic Data as a Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a range of applications in zero-shot and few-shot learning settings, including the generation of synthetic datasets for training and testing. However, to reliably use these synthetic datasets, it is essential to understand how representative they are of real-world data. We investigate this by assessing the effectiveness of generating synthetic data through LLM and using it as a benchmark for various NLP tasks. Our experiments across six datasets, and three different tasks, show that while synthetic data can effectively capture performance of various methods for simpler tasks, such as intent classification, it falls short for more complex tasks like named entity recognition. Additionally, we propose a new metric called the bias factor, which evaluates the biases introduced when the same LLM is used to both generate benchmarking data and to perform the tasks. We find that smaller LLMs exhibit biases towards their own generated data, whereas larger models do not. Overall, our findings suggest that the effectiveness of synthetic data as a benchmark varies depending on the task, and that practitioners should rely on data generated from multiple larger models whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Metric-Semantic Factor Graph Generation based on Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationships between geometric structures and semantic concepts is crucial for building accurate models of complex environments. In indoors, certain spatial constraints, such as the relative positioning of planes, remain consistent despite variations in layout. This paper explores how these invariant relationships can be captured in a graph SLAM framework by representing high-level concepts like rooms and walls, linking them to geometric elements like planes through an optimizable factor graph. Several efforts have tackled this issue with add-hoc solutions for each concept generation and with manually-defined factors.
  This paper proposes a novel method for metric-semantic factor graph generation which includes defining a semantic scene graph, integrating geometric information, and learning the interconnecting factors, all based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). An edge classification network (G-GNN) sorts the edges between planes into same room, same wall or none types. The resulting relations are clustered, generating a room or wall for each cluster. A second family of networks (F-GNN) infers the geometrical origin of the new nodes. The definition of the factors employs the same F-GNN used for the metric attribute of the generated nodes. Furthermore, share the new factor graph with the S-Graphs+ algorithm, extending its graph expressiveness and scene representation with the ultimate goal of improving the SLAM performance. The complexity of the environments is increased to N-plane rooms by training the networks on L-shaped rooms. The framework is evaluated in synthetic and simulated scenarios as no real datasets of the required complex layouts are available.</description>

Abstract: Recently, an increasing number of news organizations have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflows, leading to a further influx of AI technologists and data workers into the news industry. This has initiated cross-functional collaborations between these professionals and journalists. While prior research has explored the impact of AI-related roles entering the news industry, there is a lack of studies on how cross-functional collaboration unfolds between AI professionals and journalists. Through interviews with 17 journalists, 6 AI technologists, and 3 AI workers with cross-functional experience from leading news organizations, we investigate the current practices, challenges, and opportunities for cross-functional collaboration around AI in today's news industry. We first study how journalists and AI professionals perceive existing cross-collaboration strategies. We further explore the challenges of cross-functional collaboration and provide recommendations for enhancing future cross-functional collaboration around AI in the news industry.</description>

      <title>All-in-one foundational models learning across quantum chemical levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) potentials typically target a single quantum chemical (QC) level while the ML models developed for multi-fidelity learning have not been shown to provide scalable solutions for foundational models. Here we introduce the all-in-one (AIO) ANI model architecture based on multimodal learning which can learn an arbitrary number of QC levels. Our all-in-one learning approach offers a more general and easier-to-use alternative to transfer learning. We use it to train the AIO-ANI-UIP foundational model with the generalization capability comparable to semi-empirical GFN2-xTB and DFT with a double-zeta basis set for organic molecules. We show that the AIO-ANI model can learn across different QC levels ranging from semi-empirical to density functional theory to coupled cluster. We also use AIO models to design the foundational model {\Delta}-AIO-ANI based on {\Delta}-learning with increased accuracy and robustness compared to AIO-ANI-UIP. The code and the foundational models are available at https://github.com/dralgroup/aio-ani; they will be integrated into the universal and updatable AI-enhanced QM (UAIQM) library and made available in the MLatom package so that they can be used online at the XACS cloud computing platform (see https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom for updates).</description>

      <title>Promise and Peril of Collaborative Code Generation Models: Balancing Effectiveness and Memorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of machine learning, training models with datasets from various locations and organizations presents significant challenges due to privacy and legal concerns. The exploration of effective collaborative training settings capable of leveraging valuable knowledge from distributed and isolated datasets is increasingly crucial. This study investigates key factors that impact the effectiveness of collaborative training methods in code next-token prediction, as well as the correctness and utility of the generated code, demonstrating the promise of such methods. Additionally, we evaluate the memorization of different participant training data across various collaborative training settings, including centralized, federated, and incremental training, highlighting their potential risks in leaking data. Our findings indicate that the size and diversity of code datasets are pivotal factors influencing the success of collaboratively trained code models. We show that federated learning achieves competitive performance compared to centralized training while offering better data protection, as evidenced by lower memorization ratios in the generated code. However, federated learning can still produce verbatim code snippets from hidden training data, potentially violating privacy or copyright. Our study further explores effectiveness and memorization patterns in incremental learning, emphasizing the sequence in which individual participant datasets are introduced. We also identify cross-organizational clones as a prevalent challenge in both centralized and federated learning scenarios. Our findings highlight the persistent risk of data leakage during inference, even when training data remains unseen. We conclude with recommendations for practitioners and researchers to optimize multisource datasets, propelling cross-organizational collaboration forward.</description>

      <title>On Vision Transformers for Classification Tasks in Side-Scan Sonar Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Side-scan sonar (SSS) imagery presents unique challenges in the classification of man-made objects on the seafloor due to the complex and varied underwater environments. Historically, experts have manually interpreted SSS images, relying on conventional machine learning techniques with hand-crafted features. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) significantly advanced automated classification in this domain, they often fall short when dealing with diverse seafloor textures, such as rocky or ripple sand bottoms, where false positive rates may increase. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown potential in addressing these limitations by utilizing a self-attention mechanism to capture global information in image patches, offering more flexibility in processing spatial hierarchies. This paper rigorously compares the performance of ViT models alongside commonly used CNN architectures, such as ResNet and ConvNext, for binary classification tasks in SSS imagery. The dataset encompasses diverse geographical seafloor types and is balanced between the presence and absence of man-made objects. ViT-based models exhibit superior classification performance across f1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy metrics, although at the cost of greater computational resources. CNNs, with their inductive biases, demonstrate better computational efficiency, making them suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments like underwater vehicles. Future research directions include exploring self-supervised learning for ViTs and multi-modal fusion to further enhance performance in challenging underwater environments.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Effects of the Baidu-ULTR Logging Policy on Two-Tower Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of the two-tower model for unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) tasks, recent work suggests that it suffers from a major limitation that could lead to its collapse in industry applications: the problem of logging policy confounding. Several potential solutions have even been proposed; however, the evaluation of these methods was mostly conducted using semi-synthetic simulation experiments. This paper bridges the gap between theory and practice by investigating the confounding problem on the largest real-world dataset, Baidu-ULTR. Our main contributions are threefold: 1) we show that the conditions for the confounding problem are given on Baidu-ULTR, 2) the confounding problem bears no significant effect on the two-tower model, and 3) we point to a potential mismatch between expert annotations, the golden standard in ULTR, and user click behavior.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to employ the language of Cartan moving frames to study the geometry of the data manifolds and its Riemannian structure, via the data information metric and its curvature at data points. Using this framework and through experiments, explanations on the response of a neural network are given by pointing out the output classes that are easily reachable from a given input. This emphasizes how the proposed mathematical relationship between the output of the network and the geometry of its inputs can be exploited as an explainable artificial intelligence tool.</description>

      <title>Dual-Layer Training and Decoding of Large Language Model with Simultaneously Thinking and Speaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TadE.</description>

      <title>Fitting Multilevel Factor Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of an invertible PSD MLR matrix is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the recursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities, yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is accompanied by an open-source package that implements the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally, the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly, while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.</description>

      <title>Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient multilingual candidate retrieval</title>

Abstract: Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Qwen2.5-Math Technical Report: Toward Mathematical Expert Model via Self-Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we present a series of math-specific large language models: Qwen2.5-Math and Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. The core innovation of the Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model, it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct. (3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling, optimizing the model's performance.
  Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math competition problems.</description>

      <title>GRIN: GRadient-INformed MoE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale more effectively than dense models due to sparse computation through expert routing, selectively activating only a small subset of expert modules. However, sparse computation challenges traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard backpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN (GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping. Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2 16$\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters, outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy, achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.</description>

      <title>Decoding Style: Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Image-Guided Outfit Recommendation with Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized outfit recommendation remains a complex challenge, demanding both fashion compatibility understanding and trend awareness. This paper presents a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of large language models (LLMs) for this task, mitigating their "black box" and static nature through fine-tuning and direct feedback integration. We bridge the item visual-textual gap in items descriptions by employing image captioning with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This enables the LLM to extract style and color characteristics from human-curated fashion images, forming the basis for personalized recommendations. The LLM is efficiently fine-tuned on the open-source Polyvore dataset of curated fashion images, optimizing its ability to recommend stylish outfits. A direct preference mechanism using negative examples is employed to enhance the LLM's decision-making process. This creates a self-enhancing AI feedback loop that continuously refines recommendations in line with seasonal fashion trends. Our framework is evaluated on the Polyvore dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in two key tasks: fill-in-the-blank, and complementary item retrieval. These evaluations underline the framework's ability to generate stylish, trend-aligned outfit suggestions, continuously improving through direct feedback. The evaluation results demonstrated that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the base LLM, creating more cohesive outfits. The improved performance in these tasks underscores the proposed framework's potential to enhance the shopping experience with accurate suggestions, proving its effectiveness over the vanilla LLM based outfit generation.</description>

      <title>The Unreliability of Acoustic Systems in Alzheimer's Speech Datasets with Heterogeneous Recording Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated speech analysis is a thriving approach to detect early markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, recording conditions in most AD datasets are heterogeneous, with patients and controls often evaluated in different acoustic settings. While this is not a problem for analyses based on speech transcription or features obtained from manual alignment, it does cast serious doubts on the validity of acoustic features, which are strongly influenced by acquisition conditions. We examined this issue in the ADreSSo dataset, derived from the widely used Pitt corpus. We show that systems based on two acoustic features, MFCCs and Wav2vec 2.0 embeddings, can discriminate AD patients from controls with above-chance performance when using only the non-speech part of the audio signals. We replicated this finding in a separate dataset of Spanish speakers. Thus, in these datasets, the class can be partly predicted by recording conditions. Our results are a warning against the use of acoustic systems for identifying patients based on non-standardized recordings. We propose that acoustically heterogeneous datasets for dementia studies should be either (a) analyzed using only transcripts or other features derived from manual annotations, or (b) replaced by datasets collected with strictly controlled acoustic conditions.</description>

      <title>Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result, end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim answers.</description>

      <title>A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation, utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases, models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI development.</description>

      <title>To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.</description>

      <title>Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion. Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to 16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different metrics and in a user study. Code is available at https://github.com/felixbmuller/SAST.</description>

      <title>DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions. Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP, and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best viewed at https://dynamo-ssl.github.io</description>

      <title>FedVeca: Federated Vectorized Averaging on Non-IID Data with Adaptive Bi-directional Global Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework to alleviate the data silos, where decentralized clients collaboratively learn a global model without sharing their private data. However, the clients' Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data negatively affect the trained model, and clients with different numbers of local updates may cause significant gaps to the local gradients in each communication round. In this paper, we propose a Federated Vectorized Averaging (FedVeca) method to address the above problem on Non-IID data. Specifically, we set a novel objective for the global model which is related to the local gradients. The local gradient is defined as a bi-directional vector with step size and direction, where the step size is the number of local updates and the direction is divided into positive and negative according to our definition. In FedVeca, the direction is influenced by the step size, thus we average the bi-directional vectors to reduce the effect of different step sizes. Then, we theoretically analyze the relationship between the step sizes and the global objective, and obtain upper bounds on the step sizes per communication round. Based on the upper bounds, we design an algorithm for the server and the client to adaptively adjusts the step sizes that make the objective close to the optimum. Finally, we conduct experiments on different datasets, models and scenarios by building a prototype system, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the FedVeca method.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Complexity of Estimation and Testing under Privacy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge of producing accurate statistics while respecting the privacy of the individuals in a sample is an important area of research. We study minimax lower bounds for classes of differentially private estimators. In particular, we show how to characterize the power of a statistical test under differential privacy in a plug-and-play fashion by solving an appropriate transport problem. With specific coupling constructions, this observation allows us to derive Le Cam-type and Fano-type inequalities not only for regular definitions of differential privacy but also for  those based on Renyi divergence. We then proceed to illustrate our results on three simple, fully worked out examples. In particular, we show that the problem class has a huge importance on the provable degradation of utility due to privacy. In certain scenarios, we show that maintaining privacy results in a noticeable reduction in performance only when the level of privacy protection is very high. Conversely, for other problems, even a modest level of privacy protection can lead to a significant decrease in performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the DP-SGLD algorithm, a private convex solver, can be employed for maximum likelihood estimation with a high degree of confidence, as it provides near-optimal results with respect to both the size of the sample and the level of privacy protection. This algorithm is applicable to a broad range of parametric estimation procedures, including exponential families.</description>

      <title>A geometric view on probabilistically robust learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks have achieved super-human performance on many classification tasks, they often exhibit a worrying lack of robustness towards adversarially generated examples. Thus, considerable effort has been invested into reformulating standard Risk Minimization (RM) into an adversarially robust framework. Recently, attention has shifted towards approaches which interpolate between the robustness offered by adversarial training and the higher clean accuracy and faster training times of RM. In this paper, we take a fresh and geometric view on one such method -- Probabilistically Robust Learning (PRL). We propose a mathematical framework for understanding PRL, which allows us to identify geometric pathologies in its original formulation and to introduce a family of probabilistic nonlocal perimeter functionals to rectify them. We prove existence of solutions to the original and modified problems using novel relaxation methods and also study properties, as well as local limits, of the introduced perimeters. We also clarify, through a suitable $\Gamma$-convergence analysis, the way in which the original and modified PRL models interpolate between risk minimization and adversarial training.</description>

      <title>Initial Guessing Bias: How Untrained Networks Favor Some Classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00809v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling biasing effects in neural networks is crucial for ensuring accurate and fair model performance. In the context of classification problems, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that the structure of a deep neural network (DNN) can condition the model to assign all predictions to the same class, even before the beginning of training, and in the absence of explicit biases. We prove that, besides dataset properties, the presence of this phenomenon, which we call \textit{Initial Guessing Bias} (IGB), is influenced by model choices including dataset preprocessing methods, and architectural decisions, such as activation functions, max-pooling layers, and network depth. Our analysis of IGB provides information for architecture selection and model initialization. We also highlight theoretical consequences, such as the breakdown of node-permutation symmetry, the violation of self-averaging and the non-trivial effects that depth has on the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A Single-Loop Deep Actor-Critic Algorithm for Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Provable Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Actor-Critic algorithms, which combine Actor-Critic with deep neural network (DNN), have been among the most prevalent reinforcement learning algorithms for decision-making problems in simulated environments. However, the existing deep Actor-Critic algorithms are still not mature to solve realistic problems with non-convex stochastic constraints and high cost to interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a single-loop deep Actor-Critic (SLDAC) algorithmic framework for general constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) problems. In the actor step, the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method is applied to handle the non-convex stochastic objective and constraints. In the critic step, the critic DNNs are only updated once or a few finite times for each iteration, which simplifies the algorithm to a single-loop framework (the existing works require a sufficient number of updates for the critic step to ensure a good enough convergence of the inner loop for each iteration). Moreover, the variance of the policy gradient estimation is reduced by reusing observations from the old policy. The single-loop design and the observation reuse effectively reduce the agent-environment interaction cost and computational complexity. In spite of the biased policy gradient estimation incurred by the single-loop design and observation reuse, we prove that the SLDAC with a feasible initial point can converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tuker (KKT) point of the original problem almost surely. Simulations show that the SLDAC algorithm can achieve superior performance with much lower interaction cost.</description>

      <title>Fairness Under Demographic Scarce Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing works on fairness assume the model has full access to demographic information. However, there exist scenarios where demographic information is partially available because a record was not maintained throughout data collection or for privacy reasons. This setting is known as demographic scarce regime. Prior research has shown that training an attribute classifier to replace the missing sensitive attributes (proxy) can still improve fairness. However, using proxy-sensitive attributes worsens fairness-accuracy tradeoffs compared to true sensitive attributes. To address this limitation, we propose a framework to build attribute classifiers that achieve better fairness-accuracy tradeoffs. Our method introduces uncertainty awareness in the attribute classifier and enforces fairness on samples with demographic information inferred with the lowest uncertainty. We show empirically that enforcing fairness constraints on samples with uncertain sensitive attributes can negatively impact the fairness-accuracy tradeoff. Our experiments on five datasets showed that the proposed framework yields models with significantly better fairness-accuracy tradeoffs than classic attribute classifiers. Surprisingly, our framework can outperform models trained with fairness constraints on the true sensitive attributes in most benchmarks. We also show that these findings are consistent with other uncertainty measures such as conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Conditioning of Score-Based Diffusion Models by Neuro-Symbolic Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have emerged as effective approaches for both conditional and unconditional generation. Still conditional generation is based on either a specific training of a conditional model or classifier guidance, which requires training a noise-dependent classifier, even when a classifier for uncorrupted data is given. We propose a method that, given a pre-trained unconditional score-based generative model, samples from the conditional distribution under arbitrary logical constraints, without requiring additional training. Differently from other zero-shot techniques, that rather aim at generating valid conditional samples, our method is designed for approximating the true conditional distribution. Firstly, we show how to manipulate the learned score in order to sample from an un-normalized distribution conditional on a user-defined constraint. Then, we define a flexible and numerically stable neuro-symbolic framework for encoding soft logical constraints. Combining these two ingredients we obtain a general, but approximate, conditional sampling algorithm. We further developed effective heuristics aimed at improving the approximation. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our approach in approximating conditional distributions for various types of constraints and data: tabular data, images and time series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study reveals new theoretical insights into over-smoothing and feature over-correlation in graph neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that with increased depth, node representations become dominated by a low-dimensional subspace that depends on the aggregation function but not on the feature transformations. For all aggregation functions, the rank of the node representations collapses, resulting in over-smoothing for particular aggregation functions. Our study emphasizes the importance for future research to focus on rank collapse rather than over-smoothing. Guided by our theory, we propose a sum of Kronecker products as a beneficial property that provably prevents over-smoothing, over-correlation, and rank collapse. We empirically demonstrate the shortcomings of existing models in fitting target functions of node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Image Hijacks: Adversarial Images can Control Generative Models at Runtime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Are foundation models secure against malicious actors? In this work, we focus on the image input to a vision-language model (VLM). We discover image hijacks, adversarial images that control the behaviour of VLMs at inference time, and introduce the general Behaviour Matching algorithm for training image hijacks. From this, we derive the Prompt Matching method, allowing us to train hijacks matching the behaviour of an arbitrary user-defined text prompt (e.g. 'the Eiffel Tower is now located in Rome') using a generic, off-the-shelf dataset unrelated to our choice of prompt. We use Behaviour Matching to craft hijacks for four types of attack, forcing VLMs to generate outputs of the adversary's choice, leak information from their context window, override their safety training, and believe false statements. We study these attacks against LLaVA, a state-of-the-art VLM based on CLIP and LLaMA-2, and find that all attack types achieve a success rate of over 80%. Moreover, our attacks are automated and require only small image perturbations.</description>

      <title>Memory Gym: Towards Endless Tasks to Benchmark Memory Capabilities of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17207v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memory Gym presents a suite of 2D partially observable environments, namely Mortar Mayhem, Mystery Path, and Searing Spotlights, designed to benchmark memory capabilities in decision-making agents. These environments, originally with finite tasks, are expanded into innovative, endless formats, mirroring the escalating challenges of cumulative memory games such as ``I packed my bag''. This progression in task design shifts the focus from merely assessing sample efficiency to also probing the levels of memory effectiveness in dynamic, prolonged scenarios. To address the gap in available memory-based Deep Reinforcement Learning baselines, we introduce an implementation that integrates Transformer-XL (TrXL) with Proximal Policy Optimization. This approach utilizes TrXL as a form of episodic memory, employing a sliding window technique. Our comparative study between the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and TrXL reveals varied performances across different settings. TrXL, on the finite environments, demonstrates superior sample efficiency in Mystery Path and outperforms in Mortar Mayhem. However, GRU is more efficient on Searing Spotlights. Most notably, in all endless tasks, GRU makes a remarkable resurgence, consistently outperforming TrXL by significant margins.

      <title>mLoRA: Fine-Tuning LoRA Adapters via Highly-Efficient Pipeline Parallelism in Multiple GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across diverse domains, particularly in the emerging {\em pretrain-then-finetune} paradigm. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, is commonly used to adapt a base LLM to multiple downstream tasks. Further, LLM platforms enable developers to fine-tune multiple models and develop various domain-specific applications simultaneously. However, existing model parallelism schemes suffer from high communication overhead and inefficient GPU utilization when training multiple LoRA tasks across GPUs and machines.
  In this paper, we present mLoRA, a parallelism-efficient fine-tuning system designed for training multiple LoRA across GPUs and machines. mLoRA introduces a novel LoRA-aware pipeline parallelism scheme that efficiently pipelines independent LoRA adapters and their distinct fine-tuning stages across GPUs and machines, along with a new LoRA-efficient operator to enhance GPU utilization during pipelined LoRA training. Our extensive evaluation shows that mLoRA can significantly reduce average fine-tuning task completion time, e.g., by 30\%, compared to state-of-the-art methods like FSDP. More importantly, mLoRA enables simultaneous fine-tuning of larger models, e.g., two Llama-2-13B models on four NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB GPUs, which is not feasible for FSDP due to high memory requirements. Hence, mLoRA not only increases fine-tuning efficiency but also makes it more accessible on cost-effective GPUs. mLoRA has been deployed in AntGroup's production environment.</description>

      <title>Shapley-PC: Constraint-based Causal Structure Learning with Shapley Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal Structure Learning (CSL), also referred to as causal discovery, amounts to extracting causal relations among variables in data. CSL enables the estimation of causal effects from observational data alone, avoiding the need to perform real life experiments. Constraint-based CSL leverages conditional independence tests to perform causal discovery. We propose Shapley-PC, a novel method to improve constraint-based CSL algorithms by using Shapley values over the possible conditioning sets, to decide which variables are responsible for the observed conditional (in)dependences. We prove soundness, completeness and asymptotic consistency of Shapley-PC and run a simulation study showing that our proposed algorithm is superior to existing versions of PC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), recent years have witnessed a significant surge in the application of machine learning (ML). Despite this growth, the field grapples with a lack of unified guidelines and systematic approaches for effectively implementing these ML techniques and comprehensive analysis regarding industrial open-source data across varied scenarios. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review of ML approaches for diagnostics and prognostics of industrial systems using open-source datasets from PHM Data Challenge Competitions held between 2018 and 2023 by PHM Society and IEEE Reliability Society and summarizes a unified ML framework. This review systematically categorizes and scrutinizes the problems, challenges, methodologies, and advancements demonstrated in these competitions, highlighting the evolving role of both conventional machine learning and deep learning in tackling complex industrial tasks related to detection, diagnosis, assessment, and prognosis. Moreover, this paper delves into the common challenges in PHM data challenge competitions by emphasizing data-related and model-related issues and evaluating the limitations of these competitions. The potential solutions to address these challenges are also summarized. Finally, we identify key themes and potential directions for future research, providing opportunities and prospects for next-generation ML-PHM development in PHM domain.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning in the Cognitive Domain: Alzheimer's Disease Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, primarily affecting the elderly population and leading to significant cognitive decline. This decline manifests in various mental faculties such as attention, memory, and higher-order cognitive functions, severely impacting an individual's ability to comprehend information, acquire new knowledge, and communicate effectively. One of the tasks influenced by cognitive impairments is handwriting. By analyzing specific features of handwriting, including pressure, velocity, and spatial organization, researchers can detect subtle changes that may indicate early-stage cognitive impairments, particularly AD. Recent developments in classical artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise in detecting AD through handwriting analysis. However, as the dataset size increases, these AI approaches demand greater computational resources, and diagnoses are often affected by limited classical vector spaces and feature correlations. Recent studies have shown that quantum computing technologies, developed by harnessing the unique properties of quantum particles such as superposition and entanglement, can not only address the aforementioned problems but also accelerate complex data analysis and enable more efficient processing of large datasets. In this study, we propose a variational quantum classifier with fewer circuit elements to facilitate early AD diagnosis based on handwriting data. Our model has demonstrated comparable classification performance to classical methods and underscores the potential of quantum computing models in addressing cognitive problems, paving the way for future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network Benchmarks for Selective Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing deployment of machine learning models in many socially sensitive tasks, there is a growing demand for reliable and trustworthy predictions. One way to accomplish these requirements is to allow a model to abstain from making a prediction when there is a high risk of making an error. This requires adding a selection mechanism to the model, which selects those examples for which the model will provide a prediction. The selective classification framework aims to design a mechanism that balances the fraction of rejected predictions (i.e., the proportion of examples for which the model does not make a prediction) versus the improvement in predictive performance on the selected predictions. Multiple selective classification frameworks exist, most of which rely on deep neural network architectures. However, the empirical evaluation of the existing approaches is still limited to partial comparisons among methods and settings, providing practitioners with little insight into their relative merits. We fill this gap by benchmarking 18 baselines on a diverse set of 44 datasets that includes both image and tabular data. Moreover, there is a mix of binary and multiclass tasks. We evaluate these approaches using several criteria, including selective error rate, empirical coverage, distribution of rejected instance's classes, and performance on out-of-distribution instances. The results indicate that there is not a single clear winner among the surveyed baselines, and the best method depends on the users' objectives.</description>

      <title>Interpretable classifiers for tabular data via discretization and feature selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method for computing immediately human interpretable yet accurate classifiers from tabular data. The classifiers obtained are short Boolean formulas, computed via first discretizing the original data and then using feature selection coupled with a very fast algorithm for producing the best possible Boolean classifier for the setting. We demonstrate the approach via 12 experiments, obtaining results with accuracies comparable to ones obtained via random forests, XGBoost, and existing results for the same datasets in the literature. In most cases, the accuracy of our method is in fact similar to that of the reference methods, even though the main objective of our study is the immediate interpretability of our classifiers. We also prove a new result on the probability that the classifier we obtain from real-life data corresponds to the ideally best classifier with respect to the background distribution the data comes from.</description>

      <title>Neural Graph Generator: Feature-Conditioned Graph Generation using Latent Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph generation has emerged as a crucial task in machine learning, with significant challenges in generating graphs that accurately reflect specific properties. Existing methods often fall short in efficiently addressing this need as they struggle with the high-dimensional complexity and varied nature of graph properties. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Graph Generator (NGG), a novel approach which utilizes conditioned latent diffusion models for graph generation. NGG demonstrates a remarkable capacity to model complex graph patterns, offering control over the graph generation process. NGG employs a variational graph autoencoder for graph compression and a diffusion process in the latent vector space, guided by vectors summarizing graph statistics. We demonstrate NGG's versatility across various graph generation tasks, showing its capability to capture desired graph properties and generalize to unseen graphs. We also compare our generator to the graph generation capabilities of different LLMs. This work signifies a shift in graph generation methodologies, offering a more practical and efficient solution for generating diverse graphs with specific characteristics.</description>

      <title>EHRFL: Federated Learning Framework for Institution-Specific Model Construction using Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing volume of electronic health records (EHRs) across healthcare institutions presents the opportunity to enhance model accuracy and robustness in clinical prediction tasks. Federated learning enables training on data from multiple institutions while preserving patient privacy and complying to regulatory constraints. However, most federated learning research focuses on constructing a global model for multiple clients, overlooking the practical need for institution-specific models. In this work, we introduce EHRFL, a federated learning framework using EHRs designed to develop a model tailored to a single healthcare institution. Our framework addresses two key challenges: (1) enabling federated learning across institutions with heterogeneous EHR systems using text-based EHR modeling, and (2) reducing the costs associated with federated learning by selecting suitable participating clients using averaged patient embeddings, which enables optimizing the number of participants without compromising model performance for the institution. Our experiment results on multiple open-source EHR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EHRFL in addressing the two challenges, establishing it as a practical solution for institution-specific model development in federated learning.</description>

      <title>Calibration Error for Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calibration allows predictions to be reliably interpreted as probabilities by decision makers. We propose a decision-theoretic calibration error, the Calibration Decision Loss (CDL), defined as the maximum improvement in decision payoff obtained by calibrating the predictions, where the maximum is over all payoff-bounded decision tasks. Vanishing CDL guarantees the payoff loss from miscalibration vanishes simultaneously for all downstream decision tasks. We show separations between CDL and existing calibration error metrics, including the most well-studied metric Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Our main technical contribution is a new efficient algorithm for online calibration that achieves near-optimal $O(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}})$ expected CDL, bypassing the $\Omega(T^{-0.472})$ lower bound for ECE by Qiao and Valiant (2021).</description>

      <title>Hybrid Top-Down Global Causal Discovery with Local Search for Linear and Nonlinear Additive Noise Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning the unique directed acyclic graph corresponding to an unknown causal model is a challenging task. Methods based on functional causal models can identify a unique graph, but either suffer from the curse of dimensionality or impose strong parametric assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid approach for global causal discovery in observational data that leverages local causal substructures. We first present a topological sorting algorithm that leverages ancestral relationships in linear structural equation models to establish a compact top-down hierarchical ordering, encoding more causal information than linear orderings produced by existing methods. We demonstrate that this approach generalizes to nonlinear settings with arbitrary noise. We then introduce a nonparametric constraint-based algorithm that prunes spurious edges by searching for local conditioning sets, achieving greater accuracy than current methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for correctness and worst-case polynomial time complexities, with empirical validation on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>On Fairness of Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation of large models, particularly LoRA, has gained traction due to its computational efficiency. This efficiency, contrasted with the prohibitive costs of full-model fine-tuning, means that practitioners often turn to LoRA and sometimes without a complete understanding of its ramifications. In this study, we focus on fairness and ask whether LoRA has an unexamined impact on utility, calibration, and resistance to membership inference across different subgroups (e.g., genders, races, religions) compared to a full-model fine-tuning baseline. We present extensive experiments across vision and language domains and across classification and generation tasks using ViT-Base, Swin-v2-Large, Llama-2 7B, and Mistral 7B. Intriguingly, experiments suggest that while one can isolate cases where LoRA exacerbates model bias across subgroups, the pattern is inconsistent -- in many cases, LoRA has equivalent or even improved fairness compared to the base model or its full fine-tuning baseline. We also examine the complications of evaluating fine-tuning fairness relating to task design and model token bias, calling for more careful fairness evaluations in future work.</description>

      <title>Explore-Go: Leveraging Exploration for Generalisation in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the remaining challenges in reinforcement learning is to develop agents that can generalise to novel scenarios they might encounter once deployed. This challenge is often framed in a multi-task setting where agents train on a fixed set of tasks and have to generalise to new tasks. Recent work has shown that in this setting increased exploration during training can be leveraged to increase the generalisation performance of the agent. This makes sense when the states encountered during testing can actually be explored during training. In this paper, we provide intuition why exploration can also benefit generalisation to states that cannot be explicitly encountered during training. Additionally, we propose a novel method Explore-Go that exploits this intuition by increasing the number of states on which the agent trains. Explore-Go effectively increases the starting state distribution of the agent and as a result can be used in conjunction with most existing on-policy or off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. We show empirically that our method can increase generalisation performance in an illustrative environment and on the Procgen benchmark.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Kaplan and Chinchilla Scaling Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kaplan et al. [2020] (`Kaplan') and Hoffmann et al. [2022] (`Chinchilla') studied the scaling behavior of transformers trained on next-token language prediction. These studies produced different estimates for how the number of parameters ($N$) and training tokens ($D$) should be set to achieve the lowest possible loss for a given compute budget ($C$). Kaplan: $N_\text{optimal} \propto C^{0.73}$, Chinchilla: $N_\text{optimal} \propto C^{0.50}$. This paper finds that much of this discrepancy can be attributed to Kaplan counting non-embedding rather than total parameters, combined with their analysis being performed at small scale. Simulating the Chinchilla study under these conditions produces biased scaling coefficients close to Kaplan's. Hence, this paper reaffirms Chinchilla's scaling coefficients, by explaining the primary cause of Kaplan's original overestimation. As a second contribution, the paper explains differences in the reported relationships between loss and compute. These findings lead us to recommend that future scaling studies use total parameters and compute.</description>

      <title>Navigating High-Degree Heterogeneity: Federated Learning in Aerial and Space Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning offers a compelling solution to the challenges of networking and data privacy within aerial and space networks by utilizing vast private edge data and computing capabilities accessible through drones, balloons, and satellites. While current research has focused on optimizing the learning process, computing efficiency, and minimizing communication overhead, the heterogeneity issue and class imbalance remain a significant barrier to rapid model convergence. In this paper, we explore the influence of heterogeneity on class imbalance, which diminishes performance in Aerial and Space Networks (ASNs)-based federated learning. We illustrate the correlation between heterogeneity and class imbalance within grouped data and show how constraints such as battery life exacerbate the class imbalance challenge. Our findings indicate that ASNs-based FL faces heightened class imbalance issues even with similar levels of heterogeneity compared to other scenarios. Finally, we analyze the impact of varying degrees of heterogeneity on FL training and evaluate the efficacy of current state-of-the-art algorithms under these conditions. Our results reveal that the heterogeneity challenge is more pronounced in ASNs-based federated learning and that prevailing algorithms often fail to effectively address high levels of heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Probability Passing for Graph Neural Networks: Graph Structure and Representations Joint Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved notable success in the analysis of non-Euclidean data across a wide range of domains. However, their applicability is constrained by the dependence on the observed graph structure. To solve this problem, Latent Graph Inference (LGI) is proposed to infer a task-specific latent structure by computing similarity or edge probability of node features and then apply a GNN to produce predictions. Even so, existing approaches neglect the noise from node features, which affects generated graph structure and performance. In this work, we introduce a novel method called Probability Passing to refine the generated graph structure by aggregating edge probabilities of neighboring nodes based on observed graph. Furthermore, we continue to utilize the LGI framework, inputting the refined graph structure and node features into GNNs to obtain predictions. We name the proposed scheme as Probability Passing-based Graph Neural Network (PPGNN). Moreover, the anchor-based technique is employed to reduce complexity and improve efficiency.

      <title>Characterizing Dynamical Stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Overparameterized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For overparameterized optimization tasks, such as the ones found in modern machine learning, global minima are generally not unique. In order to understand generalization in these settings, it is vital to study to which minimum an optimization algorithm converges. The possibility of having minima that are unstable under the dynamics imposed by the optimization algorithm limits the potential minima that the algorithm can find. In this paper, we characterize the global minima that are dynamically stable/unstable for both deterministic and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, we introduce a characteristic Lyapunov exponent which depends on the local dynamics around a global minimum and rigorously prove that the sign of this Lyapunov exponent determines whether SGD can accumulate at the respective global minimum.</description>

      <title>UKAN: Unbound Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Accompanied with Accelerated Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a GPU-accelerated library for the underlying components of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), along with an algorithm to eliminate bounded grids in KANs. The GPU-accelerated library reduces the computational complexity of Basis Spline (B-spline) evaluation by a factor of $\mathcal{O}$(grid size) compared to existing codes, enabling batch computation for large-scale learning. To overcome the limitations of traditional KANs, we introduce Unbounded KANs (UKANs), which eliminate the need for a bounded grid and a fixed number of B-spline coefficients. To do so, we replace the KAN parameters (B-spline coefficients) with a coefficient generator (CG) model. The inputs to the CG model are designed based on the idea of an infinite symmetric grid extending from negative infinity to positive infinity. The positional encoding of grid group, a sequential collection of B-spline grid indexes, is fed into the CG model, and coefficients are consumed by the efficient implementation (matrix representations) of B-spline functions to generate outputs. We perform several experiments on regression, classification, and generative tasks, which are promising. In particular, UKAN does not require data normalization or a bounded domain for evaluation. Additionally, our benchmarking results indicate the superior memory and computational efficiency of our library compared to existing codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has become a popular tool across many scientific fields, including the study of differential equations, particularly partial differential equations. This work introduces the basic principles of deep learning and the Deep Galerkin method, which uses deep neural networks to solve differential equations. This primer aims to provide technical and practical insights into the Deep Galerkin method and its implementation. We demonstrate how to solve the one-dimensional heat equation step-by-step. We also show how to apply the Deep Galerkin method to solve systems of ordinary differential equations and integral equations, such as the Fredholm of the second kind. Additionally, we provide code snippets within the text and the complete source code on Github. The examples are designed so that one can run them on a simple computer without needing a GPU.</description>

      <title>Mask-Encoded Sparsification: Mitigating Biased Gradients in Communication-Efficient Split Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework designed to achieve a high compression ratio in Split Learning (SL) scenarios where resource-constrained devices are involved in large-scale model training. Our investigations demonstrate that compressing feature maps within SL leads to biased gradients that can negatively impact the convergence rates and diminish the generalization capabilities of the resulting models. Our theoretical analysis provides insights into how compression errors critically hinder SL performance, which previous methodologies underestimate. To address these challenges, we employ a narrow bit-width encoded mask to compensate for the sparsification error without increasing the order of time complexity. Supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, our framework significantly reduces compression errors and accelerates the convergence. Extensive experiments also verify that our method outperforms existing solutions regarding training efficiency and communication complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have completely transformed the domain of computational pathology (CPath). More specifically, it has altered the diagnostic workflow of pathologists by integrating foundation models (FMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in their assessment and decision-making process. The limitations of existing deep learning approaches in CPath can be overcome by FMs through learning a representation space that can be adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks without explicit supervision. Deploying VLMs allow pathology reports written in natural language be used as rich semantic information sources to improve existing models as well as generate predictions in natural language form. In this survey, a holistic and systematic overview of recent innovations in FMs and VLMs in CPath is presented. Furthermore, the tools, datasets and training schemes for these models are summarized in addition to categorizing them into distinct groups. This extensive survey highlights the current trends in CPath and its possible revolution through the use of FMs and VLMs in the future.</description>

      <title>Retrofitting Temporal Graph Neural Networks with Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) outperform regular GNNs by incorporating time information into graph-based operations. However, TGNNs adopt specialized models (e.g., TGN, TGAT, and APAN ) and require tailored training frameworks (e.g., TGL and ETC). In this paper, we propose TF-TGN, which uses Transformer decoder as the backbone model for TGNN to enjoy Transformer's codebase for efficient training. In particular, Transformer achieves tremendous success for language modeling, and thus the community developed high-performance kernels (e.g., flash-attention and memory-efficient attention) and efficient distributed training schemes (e.g., PyTorch FSDP, DeepSpeed, and Megatron-LM). We observe that TGNN resembles language modeling, i.e., the message aggregation operation between chronologically occurring nodes and their temporal neighbors in TGNNs can be structured as sequence modeling. Beside this similarity, we also incorporate a series of algorithm designs including suffix infilling, temporal graph attention with self-loop, and causal masking self-attention to make TF-TGN work. During training, existing systems are slow in transforming the graph topology and conducting graph sampling. As such, we propose methods to parallelize the CSR format conversion and graph sampling. We also adapt Transformer codebase to train TF-TGN efficiently with multiple GPUs. We experiment with 9 graphs and compare with 2 state-of-the-art TGNN training frameworks. The results show that TF-TGN can accelerate training by over 2.20 while providing comparable or even superior accuracy to existing SOTA TGNNs. TF-TGN is available at https://github.com/qianghuangwhu/TF-TGN.</description>

      <title>Improving Conditional Level Generation using Automated Validation in Match-3 Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models for level generation have shown great potential in game production. However, they often provide limited control over the generation, and the validity of the generated levels is unreliable. Despite this fact, only a few approaches that learn from existing data provide the users with ways of controlling the generation, simultaneously addressing the generation of unsolvable levels. %One of the main challenges it faces is that levels generated through automation may not be solvable thus requiring validation. are not always engaging, challenging, or even solvable. This paper proposes Avalon, a novel method to improve models that learn from existing level designs using difficulty statistics extracted from gameplay. In particular, we use a conditional variational autoencoder to generate layouts for match-3 levels, conditioning the model on pre-collected statistics such as game mechanics like difficulty and relevant visual features like size and symmetry. Our method is general enough that multiple approaches could potentially be used to generate these statistics. We quantitatively evaluate our approach by comparing it to an ablated model without difficulty conditioning. Additionally, we analyze both quantitatively and qualitatively whether the style of the dataset is preserved in the generated levels. Our approach generates more valid levels than the same method without difficulty conditioning.</description>

      <title>Operational Wind Speed Forecasts for Chile's Electric Power Sector Using a Hybrid ML Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Chile's electric power sector advances toward a future powered by renewable energy, accurate forecasting of renewable generation is essential for managing grid operations. The integration of renewable energy sources is particularly challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing their power generation, which is highly variable compared to fossil fuel sources, delaying the availability of clean energy. To mitigate this, we quantify the impact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermal power plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodology which combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based on TiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is based on a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days. Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecasts and can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping, curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile.</description>

Abstract: Synthetic opioids are the most common drugs involved in drug-involved overdose mortalities in the U.S. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2018, about 70% of all drug overdose deaths involved opioids and 67% of all opioid-involved deaths were accounted for by synthetic opioids. In this study, we investigated the spread of synthetic opioids between 2013 and 2020 in the U.S. We analyzed the relationship between the spatiotemporal pattern of synthetic opioid-involved deaths and another key opioid, heroin, and compared patterns of deaths involving these two types of drugs during this period. Spatial connections and human mobility between counties were incorporated into a graph convolutional neural network model to represent and analyze the spread of synthetic opioid-involved deaths in the context of previous heroin-involved death patterns.</description>

      <title>RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference latency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to access 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.</description>

      <title>ROOT-SGD: Sharp Nonasymptotics and Near-Optimal Asymptotics in a Single Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.12690v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of solving strongly convex and smooth unconstrained optimization problems using stochastic first-order algorithms. We devise a novel algorithm, referred to as Recursive One-Over-T SGD (ROOT-SGD), based on an easily implementable, recursive averaging of past stochastic gradients. We prove that it simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance in both a finite-sample, nonasymptotic sense and an asymptotic sense. On the non-asymptotic side, we prove risk bounds on the last iterate of ROOT-SGD with leading-order terms that match the optimal statistical risk with a unity pre-factor, along with a higher-order term that scales at the sharp rate of $O(n^{-3/2})$ under the Lipschitz condition on the Hessian matrix. On the asymptotic side, we show that when a mild, one-point Hessian continuity condition is imposed, the rescaled last iterate of (multi-epoch) ROOT-SGD converges asymptotically to a Gaussian limit with the Cram\'er-Rao optimal asymptotic covariance, for a broad range of step-size choices.</description>

Abstract: The ``sample amplification'' problem formalizes the following question: Given $n$ i.i.d. samples drawn from an unknown distribution $P$, when is it possible to produce a larger set of $n+m$ samples which cannot be distinguished from $n+m$ i.i.d. samples drawn from $P$? In this work, we provide a firm statistical foundation for this problem by deriving generally applicable amplification procedures, lower bound techniques and connections to existing statistical notions. Our techniques apply to a large class of distributions including the exponential family, and establish a rigorous connection between sample amplification and distribution learning.</description>

      <title>Adversarial attacks on neural networks through canonical Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial learning is therefore becoming a crucial task. We propose a new vision on neural network robustness using Riemannian geometry and foliation theory. The idea is illustrated by creating a new adversarial attack that takes into account the curvature of the data space. This new adversarial attack, called the two-step spectral attack is a piece-wise linear approximation of a geodesic in the data space. The data space is treated as a (degenerate) Riemannian manifold equipped with the pullback of the Fisher Information Metric (FIM) of the neural network. In most cases, this metric is only semi-definite and its kernel becomes a central object to study. A canonical foliation is derived from this kernel. The curvature of transverse leaves gives the appropriate correction to get a two-step approximation of the geodesic and hence a new efficient adversarial attack. The method is first illustrated on a 2D toy example in order to visualize the neural network foliation and the corresponding attacks. Next, we report numerical results on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets with the proposed technique and state of the art attacks presented in Zhao et al. (2019) (OSSA) and Croce et al. (2020) (AutoAttack). The result show that the proposed attack is more efficient at all levels of available budget for the attack (norm of the attack), confirming that the curvature of the transverse neural network FIM foliation plays an important role in the robustness of neural networks. The main objective and interest of this study is to provide a mathematical understanding of the geometrical issues at play in the data space when constructing efficient attacks on neural networks.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Horizon Reach-Avoid Zero-Sum Games via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the infinite-horizon reach-avoid zero-sum game problem, where the goal is to find a set in the state space, referred to as the reach-avoid set, such that the system starting at a state therein could be controlled to reach a given target set without violating constraints under the worst-case disturbance. We address this problem by designing a new value function with a contracting Bellman backup, where the super-zero level set, i.e., the set of states where the value function is evaluated to be non-negative, recovers the reach-avoid set. Building upon this, we prove that the proposed method can be adapted to compute the viability kernel, or the set of states which could be controlled to satisfy given constraints, and the backward reachable set, or the set of states that could be driven towards a given target set. Finally, we propose to alleviate the curse of dimensionality issue in high-dimensional problems by extending Conservative Q-Learning, a deep reinforcement learning technique, to learn a value function such that the super-zero level set of the learned value function serves as a (conservative) approximation to the reach-avoid set. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that the proposed method could learn reliably the reach-avoid set and the optimal control policy even with neural network approximation.</description>

      <title>Bagged Polynomial Regression and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Series and polynomial regression are able to approximate the same function classes as neural networks. However, these methods are rarely used in practice, although they offer more interpretability than neural networks. In this paper, we show that a potential reason for this is the slow convergence rate of polynomial regression estimators and propose the use of \textit{bagged} polynomial regression (BPR) as an attractive alternative to neural networks. Theoretically, we derive new finite sample and asymptotic $L^2$ convergence rates for series estimators. We show that the rates can be improved in smooth settings by splitting the feature space and generating polynomial features separately for each partition. Empirically, we show that our proposed estimator, the BPR, can perform as well as more complex models with more parameters. Our estimator also performs close to state-of-the-art prediction methods in the benchmark MNIST handwritten digit dataset. We demonstrate that BPR performs as well as neural networks in crop classification using satellite data, a setting where prediction accuracy is critical and interpretability is often required for addressing research questions.</description>

      <title>The Bayan Algorithm: Detecting Communities in Networks Through Exact and Approximate Optimization of Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04562v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a classic network problem with extensive applications in various fields. Its most common method is using modularity maximization heuristics which rarely return an optimal partition or anything similar. Partitions with globally optimal modularity are difficult to compute, and therefore have been underexplored. Using structurally diverse networks, we compare 30 community detection methods including our proposed algorithm that offers optimality and approximation guarantees: the Bayan algorithm. Unlike existing methods, Bayan globally maximizes modularity or approximates it within a factor. Our results show the distinctive accuracy and stability of maximum-modularity partitions in retrieving planted partitions at rates higher than most alternatives for a wide range of parameter settings in two standard benchmarks. Compared to the partitions from 29 other algorithms, maximum-modularity partitions have the best medians for description length, coverage, performance, average conductance, and well clusteredness. These advantages come at the cost of additional computations which Bayan makes possible for small networks (networks that have up to 3000 edges in their largest connected component). Bayan is several times faster than using open-source and commercial solvers for modularity maximization, making it capable of finding optimal partitions for instances that cannot be optimized by any other existing method. Our results point to a few well performing algorithms, among which Bayan stands out as the most reliable method for small networks. A Python implementation of the Bayan algorithm (bayanpy) is publicly available through the package installer for Python (pip).</description>

      <title>Residual Back Projection With Untrained Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background and Objective: The success of neural networks in a number of image processing tasks has motivated their application in image reconstruction problems in computed tomography (CT). While progress has been made in this area, the lack of stability and theoretical guarantees for accuracy, together with the scarcity of high-quality training data for specific imaging domains pose challenges for many CT applications. In this paper, we present a framework for iterative reconstruction (IR) in CT that leverages the hierarchical structure of neural networks, without the need for training. Our framework incorporates this structural information as a deep image prior (DIP), and uses a novel residual back projection (RBP) connection that forms the basis for our iterations.
  Methods: We propose using an untrained U-net in conjunction with a novel residual back projection to minimize an objective function and achieve high-accuracy reconstruction. In each iteration, the weights of the untrained U-net are optimized, and the output of the U-net in the current iteration is used to update the input of the U-net in the next iteration through the aforementioned RBP connection.
  Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the RBP-DIP framework offers improvements over other state-of-the-art conventional IR methods, as well as pre-trained and untrained models with similar network structures under multiple conditions. These improvements are particularly significant in the few-view, limited-angle, and low-dose imaging configurations.
  Conclusions: Applying to both parallel and fan beam X-ray imaging, our framework shows significant improvement under multiple conditions. Furthermore, the proposed framework requires no training data and can be adjusted on-demand to adapt to different conditions (e.g. noise level, geometry, and imaged object).</description>

      <title>NN-Copula-CD: A Copula-Guided Interpretable Neural Network for Change Detection in Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Change detection (CD) in heterogeneous remote sensing images has been widely used for disaster monitoring and land-use management. In the past decade, the heterogeneous CD problem has significantly benefited from the development of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the purely data-driven DNNs perform like a black box where the lack of interpretability limits the trustworthiness and controllability of DNNs in most practical CD applications. As a powerful knowledge-driven tool, copula theory performs well in modeling relationships among random variables. To enhance the interpretability of existing neural networks for CD, we propose a knowledge-data-driven heterogeneous CD method based on a copula-guided neural network, named NN-Copula-CD. In our NN-Copula-CD, the mathematical characteristics of copula are employed as the loss functions to supervise a neural network to learn the dependence between bi-temporal heterogeneous superpixel pairs, and then the changed regions are identified via binary classification based on the degrees of dependence of all the superpixel pairs in the bi-temporal images. We conduct in-depth experiments on three datasets with heterogeneous images, including optical, synthetic aperture radar, multispectral, and near-infrared images, where both quantitative and visual results demonstrate both the effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed NN-Copula-CD method.</description>

      <title>PlaSma: Making Small Language Models Better Procedural Knowledge Models for (Counterfactual) Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Procedural planning, which entails decomposing a high-level goal into a sequence of temporally ordered steps, is an important yet intricate task for machines. It involves integrating common-sense knowledge to reason about complex and often contextualized situations, e.g. ``scheduling a doctor's appointment without a phone''. While current approaches show encouraging results using large language models (LLMs), they are hindered by drawbacks such as costly API calls and reproducibility issues. In this paper, we advocate planning using smaller language models. We present PlaSma, a novel two-pronged approach to endow small language models with procedural knowledge and (constrained) language planning capabilities. More concretely, we develop symbolic procedural knowledge distillation to enhance the commonsense knowledge in small language models and an inference-time algorithm to facilitate more structured and accurate reasoning. In addition, we introduce a new related task, Replanning, that requires a revision of a plan to cope with a constrained situation. In both the planning and replanning settings, we show that orders-of-magnitude smaller models (770M-11B parameters) can compete and often surpass their larger teacher models' capabilities. Finally, we showcase successful application of PlaSma in an embodied environment, VirtualHome.</description>

      <title>Designing Observables for Measurements with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many analyses in particle and nuclear physics use simulations to infer fundamental, effective, or phenomenological parameters of the underlying physics models. When the inference is performed with unfolded cross sections, the observables are designed using physics intuition and heuristics. We propose to design targeted observables with machine learning. Unfolded, differential cross sections in a neural network output contain the most information about parameters of interest and can be well-measured by construction. The networks are trained using a custom loss function that rewards outputs that are sensitive to the parameter(s) of interest while simultaneously penalizing outputs that are different between particle-level and detector-level (to minimize detector distortions). We demonstrate this idea in simulation using two physics models for inclusive measurements in deep inelastic scattering. We find that the new approach is more sensitive than classical observables at distinguishing the two models and also has a reduced unfolding uncertainty due to the reduced detector distortions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Step Sizes for Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive step sizes in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by utilizing quantities that we have identified as numerically traceable -- the Lipschitz constant for gradients and a concept of the local variance in search directions. Our findings yield a nearly hyperparameter-free algorithm for stochastic optimization, which has provable convergence properties and exhibits truly problem adaptive behavior on classical image classification tasks. Our framework is set in a general Hilbert space and thus enables the potential inclusion of a preconditioner through the choice of the inner product.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning: Forget-free Winning Subnetworks for Video Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11973v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), which highlights the existence of efficient subnetworks within larger, dense networks, a high-performing Winning Subnetwork (WSN) in terms of task performance under appropriate sparsity conditions is considered for various continual learning tasks. It leverages pre-existing weights from dense networks to achieve efficient learning in Task Incremental Learning (TIL) and Task-agnostic Incremental Learning (TaIL) scenarios. In Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL), a variation of WSN referred to as the Soft subnetwork (SoftNet) is designed to prevent overfitting when the data samples are scarce. Furthermore, the sparse reuse of WSN weights is considered for Video Incremental Learning (VIL). The use of Fourier Subneural Operator (FSO) within WSN is considered. It enables compact encoding of videos and identifies reusable subnetworks across varying bandwidths. We have integrated FSO into different architectural frameworks for continual learning, including VIL, TIL, and FSCIL. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate FSO's effectiveness, significantly improving task performance at various convolutional representational levels. Specifically, FSO enhances higher-layer performance in TIL and FSCIL and lower-layer performance in VIL.</description>

      <title>Hyper-STTN: Social Group-aware Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for Human Trajectory Prediction with Hypergraph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting crowded intents and trajectories is crucial in varouls real-world applications, including service robots and autonomous vehicles. Understanding environmental dynamics is challenging, not only due to the complexities of modeling pair-wise spatial and temporal interactions but also the diverse influence of group-wise interactions. To decode the comprehensive pair-wise and group-wise interactions in crowded scenarios, we introduce Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. In Hyper-STTN, crowded group-wise correlations are constructed using a set of multi-scale hypergraphs with varying group sizes, captured through random-walk robability-based hypergraph spectral convolution. Additionally, a spatial-temporal transformer is adapted to capture pedestrians' pair-wise latent interactions in spatial-temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous group-wise and pair-wise are then fused and aligned though a multimodal transformer network. Hyper-STTN outperformes other state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models on 5 real-world pedestrian motion datasets.</description>

      <title>Tracking-Assisted Object Detection with Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-based object detection has recently garnered attention in the computer vision community due to the exceptional properties of event cameras, such as high dynamic range and no motion blur. However, feature asynchronism and sparsity cause invisible objects due to no relative motion to the camera, posing a significant challenge in the task. Prior works have studied various implicit-learned memories to retain as many temporal cues as possible. However, implicit memories still struggle to preserve long-term features effectively. In this paper, we consider those invisible objects as pseudo-occluded objects and aim to detect them by tracking through occlusions. Firstly, we introduce the visibility attribute of objects and contribute an auto-labeling algorithm to not only clean the existing event camera dataset but also append additional visibility labels to it. Secondly, we exploit tracking strategies for pseudo-occluded objects to maintain their permanence and retain their bounding boxes, even when features have not been available for a very long time. These strategies can be treated as an explicit-learned memory guided by the tracking objective to record the displacements of objects across frames. Lastly, we propose a spatio-temporal feature aggregation module to enrich the latent features and a consistency loss to increase the robustness of the overall pipeline. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify our method's effectiveness where still objects are retained, but real occluded objects are discarded. The results demonstrate that (1) the additional visibility labels can assist in supervised training, and (2) our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a significant improvement of 7.9% absolute mAP.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Transformer and Attention Based Recurrent Neural Network for Robust and Interpretable Sentiment Analysis of Tweets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00297v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding public opinion and consumer behavior. Existing models face challenges with linguistic diversity, generalizability, and explainability. We propose TRABSA, a hybrid framework integrating transformer-based architectures, attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM networks to address this. Leveraging RoBERTa-trained on 124M tweets, we bridge gaps in sentiment analysis benchmarks, ensuring state-of-the-art accuracy. Augmenting datasets with tweets from 32 countries and US states, we compare six word-embedding techniques and three lexicon-based labeling techniques, selecting the best for optimal sentiment analysis. TRABSA outperforms traditional ML and deep learning models with 94% accuracy and significant precision, recall, and F1-score gains. Evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates consistent superiority and generalizability. SHAP and LIME analyses enhance interpretability, improving confidence in predictions. Our study facilitates pandemic resource management, aiding resource planning, policy formation, and vaccination tactics.</description>

      <title>Model-free quantification of completeness, uncertainties, and outliers in atomistic machine learning using information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An accurate description of information is relevant for a range of problems in atomistic machine learning (ML), such as crafting training sets, performing uncertainty quantification (UQ), or extracting physical insights from large datasets. However, atomistic ML often relies on unsupervised learning or model predictions to analyze information contents from simulation or training data. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that provides a rigorous, model-free tool to quantify information contents in atomistic simulations. We demonstrate that the information entropy of a distribution of atom-centered environments explains known heuristics in ML potential developments, from training set sizes to dataset optimality. Using this tool, we propose a model-free UQ method that reliably predicts epistemic uncertainty and detects out-of-distribution samples, including rare events in systems such as nucleation. This method provides a general tool for data-driven atomistic modeling and combines efforts in ML, simulations, and physical explainability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are revolutionizing several areas, including artificial creativity. However, the process of generation in machines profoundly diverges from that observed in humans. In particular, machine generation is characterized by a lack of intentionality and an underlying creative process. We propose a method called Creative Beam Search that uses Diverse Beam Search and LLM-as-a-Judge to perform response generation and response validation. The results of a qualitative experiment show how our approach can provide better output than standard sampling techniques. We also show that the response validation step is a necessary complement to the response generation step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new approach to bridge the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based perception. Our formulation is designed for dynamic scenes, consisting of small moving objects or human actions. We propose an extension of K-Planes Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), wherein our algorithm stores a set of tiered feature vectors. The tiered feature vectors are generated to effectively model conceptual information about a scene as well as an image decoder that transforms output feature maps into RGB images. Our technique leverages the information amongst both static and dynamic objects within a scene and is able to capture salient scene attributes of high altitude videos. We evaluate its performance on challenging datasets, including Okutama Action and UG2, and observe considerable improvement in accuracy over state of the art neural rendering methods.</description>

      <title>A Robust Autoencoder Ensemble-Based Approach for Anomaly Detection in Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a fast growing and popular domain among established applications like vision and time series. We observe a rich literature for these applications, but anomaly detection in text is only starting to blossom. Recently, self-supervised methods with self-attention mechanism have been the most popular choice. While recent works have proposed a working ground for building and benchmarking state of the art approaches, we propose two principal contributions in this paper: contextual anomaly contamination and a novel ensemble-based approach. Our method, Textual Anomaly Contamination (TAC), allows to contaminate inlier classes with either independent or contextual anomalies. In the literature, it appears that this distinction is not performed. For finding contextual anomalies, we propose RoSAE, a Robust Subspace Local Recovery Autoencoder Ensemble. All autoencoders of the ensemble present a different latent representation through local manifold learning. Benchmark shows that our approach outperforms recent works on both independent and contextual anomalies, while being more robust. We also provide 8 dataset comparison instead of only relying to Reuters and 20 Newsgroups corpora.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient flows play a substantial role in addressing many machine learning problems. We examine the convergence in continuous-time of a \textit{Fisher-Rao} (Mean-Field Birth-Death) gradient flow in the context of solving convex-concave min-max games with entropy regularization. We propose appropriate Lyapunov functions to demonstrate convergence with explicit rates to the unique mixed Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>MEMO-QCD: Quantum Density Estimation through Memetic Optimisation for Quantum Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a strategy for efficient quantum circuit design for density estimation. The strategy is based on a quantum-inspired algorithm for density estimation and a circuit optimisation routine based on memetic algorithms. The model maps a training dataset to a quantum state represented by a density matrix through a quantum feature map. This training state encodes the probability distribution of the dataset in a quantum state, such that the density of a new sample can be estimated by projecting its corresponding quantum state onto the training state. We propose the application of a memetic algorithm to find the architecture and parameters of a variational quantum circuit that implements the quantum feature map, along with a variational learning strategy to prepare the training state. Demonstrations of the proposed strategy show an accurate approximation of the Gaussian kernel density estimation method through shallow quantum circuits illustrating the feasibility of the algorithm for near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Specify What? Enhancing Neural Specification Synthesis by Symbolic Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how combinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic analyses can be used to synthesise specifications of C programs. The LLM prompts are augmented with outputs from two formal methods tools in the Frama-C ecosystem, Pathcrawler and EVA, to produce C program annotations in the specification language ACSL. We demonstrate how the addition of symbolic analysis to the workflow impacts the quality of annotations: information about input/output examples from Pathcrawler produce more context-aware annotations, while the inclusion of EVA reports yields annotations more attuned to runtime errors. In addition, we show that the method infers rather the programs intent than its behaviour, by generating specifications for buggy programs and observing robustness of the result against bugs.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic clean-label backdoor mitigation in cybersecurity environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training phase of machine learning models is a delicate step, especially in cybersecurity contexts. Recent research has surfaced a series of insidious training-time attacks that inject backdoors in models designed for security classification tasks without altering the training labels. With this work, we propose new techniques that leverage insights in cybersecurity threat models to effectively mitigate these clean-label poisoning attacks, while preserving the model utility. By performing density-based clustering on a carefully chosen feature subspace, and progressively isolating the suspicious clusters through a novel iterative scoring procedure, our defensive mechanism can mitigate the attacks without requiring many of the common assumptions in the existing backdoor defense literature. To show the generality of our proposed mitigation, we evaluate it on two clean-label model-agnostic attacks on two different classic cybersecurity data modalities: network flows classification and malware classification, using gradient boosting and neural network models.</description>

      <title>Training Foundation Models as Data Compression: On Information, Model Weights and Copyright Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training process of foundation models as for other classes of deep learning systems is based on minimizing the reconstruction error over a training set. For this reason, they are susceptible to the memorization and subsequent reproduction of training samples. In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights could be considered a reproduction or a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers. We demonstrate that adopting an information-centric approach to the problem presents a promising pathway for tackling these emerging complex legal issues.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Worldwide Image Geolocation by Ensembling Satellite-Based Ground-Level Attribute Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the challenge of estimating the location of a single ground-level image in the absence of GPS or other location metadata. Currently, geolocation systems are evaluated by measuring the Great Circle Distance between the predicted location and ground truth. Because this measurement only uses a single point, it cannot assess the distribution of predictions by geolocation systems. Evaluation of a distribution of potential locations (areas) is required when there are follow-on procedures to further narrow down or verify the location. This is especially important in poorly-sampled regions e.g. rural and wilderness areas.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, Recall vs Area (RvA), which measures the accuracy of estimated distributions of locations. RvA treats image geolocation results similarly to document retrieval, measuring recall as a function of area: For a ranked list of (possibly discontiguous) predicted regions, we measure the area required for accumulated regions to contain the ground truth coordinate. This produces a curve similar to a precision-recall curve, where "precision" is replaced by square kilometers area, enabling evaluation for different downstream search area budgets.
  Following from this view of the problem, we then examine an ensembling approach to global-scale image geolocation, which incorporates information from multiple sources, and can readily incorporate multiple models, attribute predictors, and data sources. We study its effectiveness by combining the geolocation models GeoEstimation and the current state-of-the-art, GeoCLIP, with attribute predictors based on Oak Ridge National Laboratory LandScan and European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover. We find significant improvements in image geolocation for areas that are under-represented in the training set, particularly non-urban areas, on both Im2GPS3k and Street View images.</description>

      <title>Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation to develop empirically effective algorithms for image restoration. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments over multiple datasets across several restoration tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Changepoint Detection: Penalty Learning through Deep Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changepoint detection, a technique for identifying significant shifts within data sequences, is crucial in various fields such as finance, genomics, medicine, etc. Dynamic programming changepoint detection algorithms are employed to identify the locations of changepoints within a sequence, which rely on a penalty parameter to regulate the number of changepoints. To estimate this penalty parameter, previous work uses simple models such as linear or tree-based models. This study introduces a novel deep learning method for predicting penalty parameters, leading to demonstrably improved changepoint detection accuracy on large benchmark supervised labeled datasets compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Combined Sewer Systems for Urban Sustainability: An Empirical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change poses complex challenges, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to model. Examples include the dynamics of Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overburdened CSS during heavy rainfall will overflow untreated wastewater into surface water bodies. Classical approaches to modeling the impact of extreme rainfall events rely on physical simulations, which are particularly challenging to create for large urban infrastructures. Deep Learning (DL) models offer a cost-effective alternative for modeling the complex dynamics of sewer systems. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art DL time series models for predicting sewer system dynamics in a large urban infrastructure, utilizing three years of measurement data. We especially investigate the potential of DL models to maintain predictive precision during network outages by comparing global models, which have access to all variables within the sewer system, and local models, which are limited to data from a restricted set of local sensors. Our findings demonstrate that DL models can accurately predict the dynamics of sewer system load, even under network outage conditions. These results suggest that DL models can effectively aid in balancing the load redistribution in CSS, thereby enhancing the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructures.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotically Optimal Coordinate Descent Algorithm for Learning Bayesian Networks from Gaussian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning Bayesian networks from continuous observational data, generated according to a linear Gaussian structural equation model. We consider an $\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator for this problem which is known to have favorable statistical properties but is computationally challenging to solve, especially for medium-sized Bayesian networks. We propose a new coordinate descent algorithm to approximate this estimator and prove several remarkable properties of our procedure: the algorithm converges to a coordinate-wise minimum, and despite the non-convexity of the loss function, as the sample size tends to infinity, the objective value of the coordinate descent solution converges to the optimal objective value of the $\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator. Finite-sample statistical consistency guarantees are also established. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first coordinate descent procedure endowed with optimality and statistical guarantees in the context of learning Bayesian networks. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that our coordinate descent method can obtain near-optimal solutions while being scalable.</description>

      <title>MMLU-Pro+: Evaluating Higher-Order Reasoning and Shortcut Learning in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) increasingly struggle to differentiate between top-performing models, underscoring the need for more challenging evaluation frameworks. We introduce MMLU-Pro+, an enhanced benchmark building upon MMLU-Pro to assess shortcut learning and higher-order reasoning in LLMs. By incorporating questions with multiple correct answers across diverse domains, MMLU-Pro+ tests LLMs' ability to engage in complex reasoning and resist simplistic problem-solving strategies. Our results show that MMLU-Pro+ maintains MMLU-Pro's difficulty while providing a more rigorous test of model discrimination, particularly in multi-correct answer scenarios. We introduce novel metrics like shortcut selection ratio and correct pair identification ratio, offering deeper insights into model behavior and anchoring bias. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting variations in reasoning abilities and bias susceptibility. We release the dataset and evaluation codes at \url{https://github.com/asgsaeid/mmlu-pro-plus}.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Solving Rare MIP Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) has been extensively applied in areas requiring mathematical solvers to address complex instances within tight time constraints. However, as the problem scale increases, the complexity of model formulation and finding feasible solutions escalates significantly. In contrast, the model-building cost for end-to-end models, such as large language models (LLMs), remains largely unaffected by problem scale due to their pattern recognition capabilities. While LLMs, like GPT-4, without fine-tuning, can handle some traditional medium-scale MIP problems, they struggle with uncommon or highly specialized MIP scenarios. Fine-tuning LLMs can yield some feasible solutions for medium-scale MIP instances, but these models typically fail to explore diverse solutions when constrained by a low and constant temperature, limiting their performance. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a recursively dynamic temperature method integrated with a chain-of-thought approach. Our findings show that starting with a high temperature and gradually lowering it leads to better feasible solutions compared to other dynamic temperature strategies. Additionally, by comparing results generated by the LLM with those from Gurobi, we demonstrate that the LLM can produce solutions that complement traditional solvers by accelerating the pruning process and improving overall efficiency.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Imitation under Mismatched Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human demonstrations as prompts are a powerful way to program robots to do long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, translating these demonstrations into robot-executable actions presents significant challenges due to execution mismatches in movement styles and physical capabilities. Existing methods either depend on robot-demonstrator paired data, which is infeasible to scale, or rely too heavily on frame-level visual similarities that often break down in practice. To address these challenges, we propose RHyME, a novel framework that automatically aligns robot and demonstrator task executions using optimal transport costs. Given long-horizon robot demonstrations, RHyME synthesizes semantically equivalent demonstrator videos by retrieving and composing short-horizon demonstrator clips. This approach facilitates effective policy training without the need for paired data. We demonstrate that RHyME outperforms a range of baselines across cross-embodiment datasets, showing a 52% increase in task recall over prior cross-embodiment learning methods. We release our code and datasets at https://portal-cornell.github.io/rhyme/.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations.</description>

      <title>SIG: A Synthetic Identity Generation Pipeline for Generating Evaluation Datasets for Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence applications expand, the evaluation of models faces heightened scrutiny. Ensuring public readiness requires evaluation datasets, which differ from training data by being disjoint and ethically sourced in compliance with privacy regulations. The performance and fairness of face recognition systems depend significantly on the quality and representativeness of these evaluation datasets. This data is sometimes scraped from the internet without user's consent, causing ethical concerns that can prohibit its use without proper releases. In rare cases, data is collected in a controlled environment with consent, however, this process is time-consuming, expensive, and logistically difficult to execute. This creates a barrier for those unable to conjure the immense resources required to gather ethically sourced evaluation datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synthetic Identity Generation pipeline, or SIG, that allows for the targeted creation of ethical, balanced datasets for face recognition evaluation. Our proposed and demonstrated pipeline generates high-quality images of synthetic identities with controllable pose, facial features, and demographic attributes, such as race, gender, and age. We also release an open-source evaluation dataset named ControlFace10k, consisting of 10,008 face images of 3,336 unique synthetic identities balanced across race, gender, and age, generated using the proposed SIG pipeline. We analyze ControlFace10k along with a non-synthetic BUPT dataset using state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness as an evaluation tool. This analysis highlights the dataset's characteristics and its utility in assessing algorithmic bias across different demographic groups.</description>

      <title>Multi-Microphone and Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition in Reverberant Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-modal Emotion Recognition (MER) system designed to enhance emotion recognition accuracy in challenging acoustic conditions. Our approach combines a modified and extended Hierarchical Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT) for multi-channel audio processing with an R(2+1)D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model for video analysis. We evaluate our proposed method on a reverberated version of the Ryerson audio-visual database of emotional speech and song (RAVDESS) dataset using synthetic and real-world Room Impulse Responsess (RIRs). Our results demonstrate that integrating audio and video modalities yields superior performance compared to uni-modal approaches, especially in challenging acoustic conditions. Moreover, we show that the multimodal (audiovisual) approach that utilizes multiple microphones outperforms its single-microphone counterpart.</description>

      <title>ReflectDiffu:Reflect between Emotion-intent Contagion and Mimicry for Empathetic Response Generation via a RL-Diffusion Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional and intentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions. Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect the mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation for Automated Structured Data Extraction from Diagnostic Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate an automated system for extracting structured clinical information from unstructured radiology and pathology reports using open-weights large language models (LMs) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and to assess the effects of model configuration variables on extraction performance. Methods and Materials: The study utilized two datasets: 7,294 radiology reports annotated for Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) scores and 2,154 pathology reports annotated for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. An automated pipeline was developed to benchmark the performance of various LMs and RAG configurations. The impact of model size, quantization, prompting strategies, output formatting, and inference parameters was systematically evaluated. Results: The best performing models achieved over 98% accuracy in extracting BT-RADS scores from radiology reports and over 90% for IDH mutation status extraction from pathology reports. The top model being medical fine-tuned llama3. Larger, newer, and domain fine-tuned models consistently outperformed older and smaller models. Model quantization had minimal impact on performance. Few-shot prompting significantly improved accuracy. RAG improved performance for complex pathology reports but not for shorter radiology reports. Conclusions: Open LMs demonstrate significant potential for automated extraction of structured clinical data from unstructured clinical reports with local privacy-preserving application. Careful model selection, prompt engineering, and semi-automated optimization using annotated data are critical for optimal performance. These approaches could be reliable enough for practical use in research workflows, highlighting the potential for human-machine collaboration in healthcare data extraction.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fine-tuned Generative Models for Keyphrase Selection: A Case Study for Russian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Keyphrase selection plays a pivotal role within the domain of scholarly texts, facilitating efficient information retrieval, summarization, and indexing. In this work, we explored how to apply fine-tuned generative transformer-based models to the specific task of keyphrase selection within Russian scientific texts. We experimented with four distinct generative models, such as ruT5, ruGPT, mT5, and mBART, and evaluated their performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. The experiments were conducted on the texts of Russian scientific abstracts from four domains: mathematics &amp; computer science, history, medicine, and linguistics. The use of generative models, namely mBART, led to gains in in-domain performance (up to 4.9% in BERTScore, 9.0% in ROUGE-1, and 12.2% in F1-score) over three keyphrase extraction baselines for the Russian language. Although the results for cross-domain usage were significantly lower, they still demonstrated the capability to surpass baseline performances in several cases, underscoring the promising potential for further exploration and refinement in this research field.</description>

      <title>Active learning for energy-based antibody optimization and enhanced screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction and optimization of protein-protein binding affinity is crucial for therapeutic antibody development. Although machine learning-based prediction methods $\Delta\Delta G$ are suitable for large-scale mutant screening, they struggle to predict the effects of multiple mutations for targets without existing binders. Energy function-based methods, though more accurate, are time consuming and not ideal for large-scale screening. To address this, we propose an active learning workflow that efficiently trains a deep learning model to learn energy functions for specific targets, combining the advantages of both approaches. Our method integrates the RDE-Network deep learning model with Rosetta's energy function-based Flex ddG to efficiently explore mutants. In a case study targeting HER2-binding Trastuzumab mutants, our approach significantly improved the screening performance over random selection and demonstrated the ability to identify mutants with better binding properties without experimental $\Delta\Delta G$ data. This workflow advances computational antibody design by combining machine learning, physics-based computations, and active learning to achieve more efficient antibody development.</description>

      <title>OneEncoder: A Lightweight Framework for Progressive Alignment of Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal alignment Learning integrates information from different modalities like text, image, audio and video to create unified models. This approach develops shared representations and learns correlations between modalities, enabling applications such as visual question answering and audiovisual content analysis. Current techniques rely on large modality-specific encoders, necessitating fine-tuning or training from scratch on vast aligned datasets (e.g., text-image, text-audio, image-audio). This approach has limitations: (i) it is very expensive due to the need for training large encoders on extensive datasets, (ii) acquiring aligned large paired datasets is challenging, and (iii) adding new modalities requires retraining the entire framework to incorporate these modalities. To address these issues, we propose OneEncoder, a lightweight framework that progressively represents and aligns four modalities (image, text, audio, video). Initially, we train a lightweight Universal Projection module (UP) to align image and text modalities. Then, we freeze the pretrained UP and progressively align future modalities to those already aligned. OneEncoder operates efficiently and cost-effectively, even in scenarios where vast aligned datasets are unavailable, due to its lightweight design. Trained on small paired datasets, it shows strong performance in tasks like classification, querying, and visual question answering, surpassing methods that rely on large datasets and specialized encoders.</description>

      <title>LOLA -- An Open-Source Massively Multilingual Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents LOLA, a massively multilingual large language model trained on more than 160 languages using a sparse Mixture-of-Experts Transformer architecture. Our architectural and implementation choices address the challenge of harnessing linguistic diversity while maintaining efficiency and avoiding the common pitfalls of multilinguality. Our analysis of the evaluation results shows competitive performance in natural language generation and understanding tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how the learned expert-routing mechanism exploits implicit phylogenetic linguistic patterns to potentially alleviate the curse of multilinguality. We provide an in-depth look at the training process, an analysis of the datasets, and a balanced exploration of the model's strengths and limitations. As an open-source model, LOLA promotes reproducibility and serves as a robust foundation for future research. Our findings enable the development of compute-efficient multilingual models with strong, scalable performance across languages.</description>
