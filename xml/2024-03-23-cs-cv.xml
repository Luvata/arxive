      <title>Measuring Diversity in Co-creative Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality and diversity have been proposed as reasonable heuristics for assessing content generated by co-creative systems, but to date there has been little agreement around what constitutes the latter or how to measure it. Proposed approaches for assessing generative models in terms of diversity have limitations in that they compare the model's outputs to a ground truth that in the era of large pre-trained generative models might not be available, or entail an impractical number of computations. We propose an alternative based on entropy of neural network encodings for comparing diversity between sets of images that does not require ground-truth knowledge and is easy to compute. We also compare two pre-trained networks and show how the choice relates to the notion of diversity that we want to evaluate. We conclude with a discussion of the potential applications of these measures for ideation in interactive systems, model evaluation, and more broadly within computational creativity.</description>

      <title>ExMap: Leveraging Explainability Heatmaps for Unsupervised Group Robustness to Spurious Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group robustness strategies aim to mitigate learned biases in deep learning models that arise from spurious correlations present in their training datasets. However, most existing methods rely on the access to the label distribution of the groups, which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. As a result, unsupervised group robustness strategies are sought. Based on the insight that a trained model's classification strategies can be inferred accurately based on explainability heatmaps, we introduce ExMap, an unsupervised two stage mechanism designed to enhance group robustness in traditional classifiers. ExMap utilizes a clustering module to infer pseudo-labels based on a model's explainability heatmaps, which are then used during training in lieu of actual labels. Our empirical studies validate the efficacy of ExMap - We demonstrate that it bridges the performance gap with its supervised counterparts and outperforms existing partially supervised and unsupervised methods. Additionally, ExMap can be seamlessly integrated with existing group robustness learning strategies. Finally, we demonstrate its potential in tackling the emerging issue of multiple shortcut mitigation\footnote{Code available at \url{https://github.com/rwchakra/exmap}}.</description>

      <title>CoMo: Controllable Motion Generation through Language Guided Pose Code Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-motion models excel at efficient human motion generation, but existing approaches lack fine-grained controllability over the generation process. Consequently, modifying subtle postures within a motion or inserting new actions at specific moments remains a challenge, limiting the applicability of these methods in diverse scenarios. In light of these challenges, we introduce CoMo, a Controllable Motion generation model, adept at accurately generating and editing motions by leveraging the knowledge priors of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, CoMo decomposes motions into discrete and semantically meaningful pose codes, with each code encapsulating the semantics of a body part, representing elementary information such as "left knee slightly bent". Given textual inputs, CoMo autoregressively generates sequences of pose codes, which are then decoded into 3D motions. Leveraging pose codes as interpretable representations, an LLM can directly intervene in motion editing by adjusting the pose codes according to editing instructions. Experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves competitive performance in motion generation compared to state-of-the-art models while, in human studies, CoMo substantially surpasses previous work in motion editing abilities.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fingerprint Image Synthesis with GANs, Diffusion Models, and Style Transfer Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel approaches involving generative adversarial networks and diffusion models in order to synthesize high quality, live and spoof fingerprint images while preserving features such as uniqueness and diversity. We generate live fingerprints from noise with a variety of methods, and we use image translation techniques to translate live fingerprint images to spoof. To generate different types of spoof images based on limited training data we incorporate style transfer techniques through a cycle autoencoder equipped with a Wasserstein metric along with Gradient Penalty (CycleWGAN-GP) in order to avoid mode collapse and instability. We find that when the spoof training data includes distinct spoof characteristics, it leads to improved live-to-spoof translation. We assess the diversity and realism of the generated live fingerprint images mainly through the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and the False Acceptance Rate (FAR). Our best diffusion model achieved a FID of 15.78. The comparable WGAN-GP model achieved slightly higher FID while performing better in the uniqueness assessment due to a slightly lower FAR when matched against the training data, indicating better creativity. Moreover, we give example images showing that a DDPM model clearly can generate realistic fingerprint images.</description>

      <title>ACDG-VTON: Accurate and Contained Diffusion Generation for Virtual Try-On</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Try-on (VTON) involves generating images of a person wearing selected garments. Diffusion-based methods, in particular, can create high-quality images, but they struggle to maintain the identities of the input garments. We identified this problem stems from the specifics in the training formulation for diffusion. To address this, we propose a unique training scheme that limits the scope in which diffusion is trained. We use a control image that perfectly aligns with the target image during training. In turn, this accurately preserves garment details during inference. We demonstrate our method not only effectively conserves garment details but also allows for layering, styling, and shoe try-on. Our method runs multi-garment try-on in a single inference cycle and can support high-quality zoomed-in generations without training in higher resolutions. Finally, we show our method surpasses prior methods in accuracy and quality.</description>

      <title>ConGeo: Robust Cross-view Geo-localization across Ground View Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at localizing a ground-level query image by matching it to its corresponding geo-referenced aerial view. In real-world scenarios, the task requires accommodating diverse ground images captured by users with varying orientations and reduced field of views (FoVs). However, existing learning pipelines are orientation-specific or FoV-specific, demanding separate model training for different ground view variations. Such models heavily depend on the North-aligned spatial correspondence and predefined FoVs in the training data, compromising their robustness across different settings. To tackle this challenge, we propose ConGeo, a single- and cross-modal Contrastive method for Geo-localization: it enhances robustness and consistency in feature representations to improve a model's invariance to orientation and its resilience to FoV variations, by enforcing proximity between ground view variations of the same location. As a generic learning objective for cross-view geo-localization, when integrated into state-of-the-art pipelines, ConGeo significantly boosts the performance of three base models on four geo-localization benchmarks for diverse ground view variations and outperforms competing methods that train separate models for each ground view variation.</description>

      <title>SeFFeC: Semantic Facial Feature Control for Fine-grained Face Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Semantic Facial Feature Control (SeFFeC) - a novel method for fine-grained face shape editing. Our method enables the manipulation of human-understandable, semantic face features, such as nose length or mouth width, which are defined by different groups of facial landmarks. In contrast to existing methods, the use of facial landmarks enables precise measurement of the facial features, which then enables training SeFFeC without any manually annotated labels. SeFFeC consists of a transformer-based encoder network that takes a latent vector of a pre-trained generative model and a facial feature embedding as input, and learns to modify the latent vector to perform the desired face edit operation. To ensure that the desired feature measurement is changed towards the target value without altering uncorrelated features, we introduced a novel semantic face feature loss. Qualitative and quantitative results show that SeFFeC enables precise and fine-grained control of 23 facial features, some of which could not previously be controlled by other methods, without requiring manual annotations. Unlike existing methods, SeFFeC also provides deterministic control over the exact values of the facial features and more localised and disentangled face edits.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Driven Active Learning for Image Segmentation in Underwater Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning aims to select the minimum amount of data to train a model that performs similarly to a model trained with the entire dataset. We study the potential of active learning for image segmentation in underwater infrastructure inspection tasks, where large amounts of data are typically collected. The pipeline inspection images are usually semantically repetitive but with great variations in quality. We use mutual information as the acquisition function, calculated using Monte Carlo dropout. To assess the effectiveness of the framework, DenseNet and HyperSeg are trained with the CamVid dataset using active learning. In addition, HyperSeg is trained with a pipeline inspection dataset of over 50,000 images. For the pipeline dataset, HyperSeg with active learning achieved 67.5% meanIoU using 12.5% of the data, and 61.4% with the same amount of randomly selected images. This shows that using active learning for segmentation models in underwater inspection tasks can lower the cost significantly.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Hallucination Control by Visual Information Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are prone to generate plausible-sounding textual answers that, however, are not always grounded in the input image. We investigate this phenomenon, usually referred to as "hallucination" and show that it stems from an excessive reliance on the language prior. In particular, we show that as more tokens are generated, the reliance on the visual prompt decreases, and this behavior strongly correlates with the emergence of hallucinations. To reduce hallucinations, we introduce Multi-Modal Mutual-Information Decoding (M3ID), a new sampling method for prompt amplification. M3ID amplifies the influence of the reference image over the language prior, hence favoring the generation of tokens with higher mutual information with the visual prompt. M3ID can be applied to any pre-trained autoregressive VLM at inference time without necessitating further training and with minimal computational overhead. If training is an option, we show that M3ID can be paired with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve the model's reliance on the prompt image without requiring any labels. Our empirical findings show that our algorithms maintain the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs while reducing hallucinations by mitigating visually ungrounded answers. Specifically, for the LLaVA 13B model, M3ID and M3ID+DPO reduce the percentage of hallucinated objects in captioning tasks by 25% and 28%, respectively, and improve the accuracy on VQA benchmarks such as POPE by 21% and 24%.</description>

      <title>EcoSense: Energy-Efficient Intelligent Sensing for In-Shore Ship Detection through Edge-Cloud Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting marine objects inshore presents challenges owing to algorithmic intricacies and complexities in system deployment. We propose a difficulty-aware edge-cloud collaborative sensing system that splits the task into object localization and fine-grained classification. Objects are classified either at the edge or within the cloud, based on their estimated difficulty. The framework comprises a low-power device-tailored front-end model for object localization, classification, and difficulty estimation, along with a transformer-graph convolutional network-based back-end model for fine-grained classification. Our system demonstrates superior performance (mAP@0.5 +4.3%}) on widely used marine object detection datasets, significantly reducing both data transmission volume (by 95.43%) and energy consumption (by 72.7%}) at the system level. We validate the proposed system across various embedded system platforms and in real-world scenarios involving drone deployment.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Thermal Modality to Enhance Reconstruction in Low-Light Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) accomplishes photo-realistic novel view synthesis by learning the implicit volumetric representation of a scene from multi-view images, which faithfully convey the colorimetric information. However, sensor noises will contaminate low-value pixel signals, and the lossy camera image signal processor will further remove near-zero intensities in extremely dark situations, deteriorating the synthesis performance. Existing approaches reconstruct low-light scenes from raw images but struggle to recover texture and boundary details in dark regions. Additionally, they are unsuitable for high-speed models relying on explicit representations. To address these issues, we present Thermal-NeRF, which takes thermal and visible raw images as inputs, considering the thermal camera is robust to the illumination variation and raw images preserve any possible clues in the dark, to accomplish visible and thermal view synthesis simultaneously. Also, the first multi-view thermal and visible dataset (MVTV) is established to support the research on multimodal NeRF. Thermal-NeRF achieves the best trade-off between detail preservation and noise smoothing and provides better synthesis performance than previous work. Finally, we demonstrate that both modalities are beneficial to each other in 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Semantics from Space: Satellite-Guided Thermal Semantic Segmentation Annotation for Aerial Field Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to automatically generate semantic segmentation annotations for thermal imagery captured from an aerial vehicle by utilizing satellite-derived data products alongside onboard global positioning and attitude estimates. This new capability overcomes the challenge of developing thermal semantic perception algorithms for field robots due to the lack of annotated thermal field datasets and the time and costs of manual annotation, enabling precise and rapid annotation of thermal data from field collection efforts at a massively-parallelizable scale. By incorporating a thermal-conditioned refinement step with visual foundation models, our approach can produce highly-precise semantic segmentation labels using low-resolution satellite land cover data for little-to-no cost. It achieves 98.5% of the performance from using costly high-resolution options and demonstrates between 70-160% improvement over popular zero-shot semantic segmentation methods based on large vision-language models currently used for generating annotations for RGB imagery. Code will be available at: https://github.com/connorlee77/aerial-auto-segment.</description>

      <title>EventDance: Unsupervised Source-free Cross-modal Adaptation for Event-based Object Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we make the first attempt at achieving the cross-modal (i.e., image-to-events) adaptation for event-based object recognition without accessing any labeled source image data owning to privacy and commercial issues. Tackling this novel problem is non-trivial due to the novelty of event cameras and the distinct modality gap between images and events. In particular, as only the source model is available, a hurdle is how to extract the knowledge from the source model by only using the unlabeled target event data while achieving knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose a novel framework, dubbed EventDance for this unsupervised source-free cross-modal adaptation problem. Importantly, inspired by event-to-video reconstruction methods, we propose a reconstruction-based modality bridging (RMB) module, which reconstructs intensity frames from events in a self-supervised manner. This makes it possible to build up the surrogate images to extract the knowledge (i.e., labels) from the source model. We then propose a multi-representation knowledge adaptation (MKA) module that transfers the knowledge to target models learning events with multiple representation types for fully exploring the spatiotemporal information of events. The two modules connecting the source and target models are mutually updated so as to achieve the best performance. Experiments on three benchmark datasets with two adaption settings show that EventDance is on par with prior methods utilizing the source data.</description>

      <title>Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds via Grid-based Intersection Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface reconstruction from point clouds is a crucial task in the fields of computer vision and computer graphics. SDF-based methods excel at reconstructing smooth meshes with minimal error and artifacts but struggle with representing open surfaces. On the other hand, UDF-based methods can effectively represent open surfaces but often introduce noise near the surface, leading to artifacts in the mesh. In this work, we propose a novel approach that directly predicts the intersection points between sampled line segments of point pairs and implicit surfaces. This method not only preserves the ability to represent open surfaces but also eliminates artifacts in the mesh. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three datasets: ShapeNet, MGN, and ScanNet. The code will be made available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Intrinsic Image Decomposition with LiDAR Intensity Enhanced Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is the process of separating a natural image into albedo and shade without these ground truths. A recent model employing light detection and ranging (LiDAR) intensity demonstrated impressive performance, though the necessity of LiDAR intensity during inference restricts its practicality. Thus, IID models employing only a single image during inference while keeping as high IID quality as the one with an image plus LiDAR intensity are highly desired. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that utilizes only an image during inference while utilizing an image and LiDAR intensity during training. Specifically, we introduce a partially-shared model that accepts an image and LiDAR intensity individually using a different specific encoder but processes them together in specific components to learn shared representations. In addition, to enhance IID quality, we propose albedo-alignment loss and image-LiDAR conversion (ILC) paths. Albedo-alignment loss aligns the gray-scale albedo from an image to that inferred from LiDAR intensity, thereby reducing cast shadows in albedo from an image due to the absence of cast shadows in LiDAR intensity. Furthermore, to translate the input image into albedo and shade style while keeping the image contents, the input image is separated into style code and content code by encoders. The ILC path mutually translates the image and LiDAR intensity, which share content but differ in style, contributing to the distinct differentiation of style from content. Consequently, LIET achieves comparable IID quality to the existing model with LiDAR intensity, while utilizing only an image without LiDAR intensity during inference.</description>

Abstract: The expanding role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in diverse engineering domains highlights the challenges associated with deploying AI models in new operational environments, involving substantial investments in data collection and model training. Rapid application of AI necessitates evaluating the feasibility of utilizing pre-trained models in unobserved operational settings with minimal or no additional data. However, interpreting the opaque nature of AI's black-box models remains a persistent challenge. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes a science-based certification methodology to assess the viability of employing pre-trained data-driven models in untrained operational environments. The methodology advocates a profound integration of domain knowledge, leveraging theoretical and analytical models from physics and related disciplines, with data-driven AI models. This novel approach introduces tools to facilitate the development of secure engineering systems, providing decision-makers with confidence in the trustworthiness and safety of AI-based models across diverse environments characterized by limited training data and dynamic, uncertain conditions. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of this methodology in real-world safety-critical scenarios, particularly in the context of traffic state estimation. Through simulation results, the study illustrates how the proposed methodology efficiently quantifies physical inconsistencies exhibited by pre-trained AI models. By utilizing analytical models, the methodology offers a means to gauge the applicability of pre-trained AI models in new operational environments. This research contributes to advancing the understanding and deployment of AI models, offering a robust certification framework that enhances confidence in their reliability and safety across a spectrum of operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Text-Enhanced Data-free Approach for Federated Class-Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) is an underexplored yet pivotal issue, involving the dynamic addition of new classes in the context of federated learning. In this field, Data-Free Knowledge Transfer (DFKT) plays a crucial role in addressing catastrophic forgetting and data privacy problems. However, prior approaches lack the crucial synergy between DFKT and the model training phases, causing DFKT to encounter difficulties in generating high-quality data from a non-anchored latent space of the old task model. In this paper, we introduce LANDER (Label Text Centered Data-Free Knowledge Transfer) to address this issue by utilizing label text embeddings (LTE) produced by pretrained language models. Specifically, during the model training phase, our approach treats LTE as anchor points and constrains the feature embeddings of corresponding training samples around them, enriching the surrounding area with more meaningful information. In the DFKT phase, by using these LTE anchors, LANDER can synthesize more meaningful samples, thereby effectively addressing the forgetting problem. Additionally, instead of tightly constraining embeddings toward the anchor, the Bounding Loss is introduced to encourage sample embeddings to remain flexible within a defined radius. This approach preserves the natural differences in sample embeddings and mitigates the embedding overlap caused by heterogeneous federated settings. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet demonstrate that LANDER significantly outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in FCIL.

      <title>MaskSAM: Towards Auto-prompt SAM with Mask Classification for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model~(SAM), a prompt-driven foundation model for natural image segmentation, has demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance. However, SAM does not work when directly applied to medical image segmentation tasks, since SAM lacks the functionality to predict semantic labels for predicted masks and needs to provide extra prompts, such as points or boxes, to segment target regions. Meanwhile, there is a huge gap between 2D natural images and 3D medical images, so the performance of SAM is imperfect for medical image segmentation tasks. Following the above issues, we propose MaskSAM, a novel mask classification prompt-free SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation. We design a prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate a set of auxiliary classifier tokens, auxiliary binary masks, and auxiliary bounding boxes. Each pair of auxiliary mask and box prompts, which can solve the requirements of extra prompts, is associated with class label predictions by the sum of the auxiliary classifier token and the learnable global classifier tokens in the mask decoder of SAM to solve the predictions of semantic labels. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-convolution adapter for image embeddings and a 3D depth-MLP adapter for prompt embeddings. We inject one of them into each transformer block in the image encoder and mask decoder to enable pre-trained 2D SAM models to extract 3D information and adapt to 3D medical images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AMOS2022, 90.52% Dice, which improved by 2.7% compared to nnUNet. Our method surpasses nnUNet by 1.7% on ACDC and 1.0% on Synapse datasets.</description>

      <title>Existence Is Chaos: Enhancing 3D Human Motion Prediction with Uncertainty Consideration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion prediction is consisting in forecasting future body poses from historically observed sequences. It is a longstanding challenge due to motion's complex dynamics and uncertainty. Existing methods focus on building up complicated neural networks to model the motion dynamics. The predicted results are required to be strictly similar to the training samples with L2 loss in current training pipeline. However, little attention has been paid to the uncertainty property which is crucial to the prediction task. We argue that the recorded motion in training data could be an observation of possible future, rather than a predetermined result. In addition, existing works calculate the predicted error on each future frame equally during training, while recent work indicated that different frames could play different roles. In this work, a novel computationally efficient encoder-decoder model with uncertainty consideration is proposed, which could learn proper characteristics for future frames by a dynamic function. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our uncertainty consideration approach has obvious advantages both in quantity and quality. Moreover, the proposed method could produce motion sequences with much better quality that avoids the intractable shaking artefacts. We believe our work could provide a novel perspective to consider the uncertainty quality for the general motion prediction task and encourage the studies in this field. The code will be available in https://github.com/Motionpre/Adaptive-Salient-Loss-SAGGB.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Proximity-Aware Dual-Path Model for Panoramic Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panoramic Activity Recognition (PAR) seeks to identify diverse human activities across different scales, from individual actions to social group and global activities in crowded panoramic scenes. PAR presents two major challenges: 1) recognizing the nuanced interactions among numerous individuals and 2) understanding multi-granular human activities. To address these, we propose Social Proximity-aware Dual-Path Network (SPDP-Net) based on two key design principles. First, while previous works often focus on spatial distance among individuals within an image, we argue to consider the spatio-temporal proximity. It is crucial for individual relation encoding to correctly understand social dynamics. Secondly, deviating from existing hierarchical approaches (individual-to-social-to-global activity), we introduce a dual-path architecture for multi-granular activity recognition. This architecture comprises individual-to-global and individual-to-social paths, mutually reinforcing each other's task with global-local context through multiple layers. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the spatio-temporal proximity among individuals and the dual-path architecture in PAR. Furthermore, SPDP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 46.5\% of overall F1 score on JRDB-PAR dataset.</description>

      <title>Test-time Similarity Modification for Person Re-identification toward Temporal Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Person re-identification (re-id), which aims to retrieve images of the same person in a given image from a database, is one of the most practical image recognition applications. In the real world, however, the environments that the images are taken from change over time. This causes a distribution shift between training and testing and degrades the performance of re-id. To maintain re-id performance, models should continue adapting to the test environment's temporal changes. Test-time adaptation (TTA), which aims to adapt models to the test environment with only unlabeled test data, is a promising way to handle this problem because TTA can adapt models instantly in the test environment. However, the previous TTA methods are designed for classification and cannot be directly applied to re-id. This is because the set of people's identities in the dataset differs between training and testing in re-id, whereas the set of classes is fixed in the current TTA methods designed for classification. To improve re-id performance in changing test environments, we propose TEst-time similarity Modification for Person re-identification (TEMP), a novel TTA method for re-id. TEMP is the first fully TTA method for re-id, which does not require any modification to pre-training. Inspired by TTA methods that refine the prediction uncertainty in classification, we aim to refine the uncertainty in re-id. However, the uncertainty cannot be computed in the same way as classification in re-id since it is an open-set task, which does not share person labels between training and testing. Hence, we propose re-id entropy, an alternative uncertainty measure for re-id computed based on the similarity between the feature vectors. Experiments show that the re-id entropy can measure the uncertainty on re-id and TEMP improves the performance of re-id in online settings where the distribution changes over time.</description>

      <title>Training point-based deep learning networks for forest segmentation with synthetic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing through unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has been increasing in forestry in recent years, along with using machine learning for data processing. Deep learning architectures, extensively applied in natural language and image processing, have recently been extended to the point cloud domain. However, the availability of point cloud datasets for training and testing remains limited. Creating forested environment point cloud datasets is expensive, requires high-precision sensors, and is time-consuming as manual point classification is required. Moreover, forest areas could be inaccessible or dangerous for humans, further complicating data collection. Then, a question arises whether it is possible to use synthetic data to train deep learning networks without the need to rely on large volumes of real forest data. To answer this question, we developed a realistic simulator that procedurally generates synthetic forest scenes. Thanks to this, we have conducted a comparative study of different state-of-the-art point-based deep learning networks for forest segmentation. Using created datasets, we determined the feasibility of using synthetic data to train deep learning networks to classify point clouds from real forest datasets. Both the simulator and the datasets are released as part of this work.</description>

      <title>C-TPT: Calibrated Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models via Text Feature Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In deep learning, test-time adaptation has gained attention as a method for model fine-tuning without the need for labeled data. A prime exemplification is the recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to improve accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration-a crucial aspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration methods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical for test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during test-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through a series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects the calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature dispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average Text Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration error and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT), for optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show that C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning without needing labeled data.</description>

      <title>External Knowledge Enhanced 3D Scene Generation from Sketch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating realistic 3D scenes is challenging due to the complexity of room layouts and object geometries.We propose a sketch based knowledge enhanced diffusion architecture (SEK) for generating customized, diverse, and plausible 3D scenes. SEK conditions the denoising process with a hand-drawn sketch of the target scene and cues from an object relationship knowledge base. We first construct an external knowledge base containing object relationships and then leverage knowledge enhanced graph reasoning to assist our model in understanding hand-drawn sketches. A scene is represented as a combination of 3D objects and their relationships, and then incrementally diffused to reach a Gaussian distribution.We propose a 3D denoising scene transformer that learns to reverse the diffusion process, conditioned by a hand-drawn sketch along with knowledge cues, to regressively generate the scene including the 3D object instances as well as their layout. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that our model improves FID, CKL by 17.41%, 37.18% in 3D scene generation and FID, KID by 19.12%, 20.06% in 3D scene completion compared to the nearest competitor DiffuScene.</description>

      <title>Soft Masked Transformer for Point Cloud Processing with Skip Attention-Based Upsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud processing methods leverage local and global point features %at the feature level to cater to downstream tasks, yet they often overlook the task-level context inherent in point clouds during the encoding stage. We argue that integrating task-level information into the encoding stage significantly enhances performance. To that end, we propose SMTransformer which incorporates task-level information into a vector-based transformer by utilizing a soft mask generated from task-level queries and keys to learn the attention weights. Additionally, to facilitate effective communication between features from the encoding and decoding layers in high-level tasks such as segmentation, we introduce a skip-attention-based up-sampling block. This block dynamically fuses features from various resolution points across the encoding and decoding layers. To mitigate the increase in network parameters and training time resulting from the complexity of the aforementioned blocks, we propose a novel shared position encoding strategy. This strategy allows various transformer blocks to share the same position information over the same resolution points, thereby reducing network parameters and training time without compromising accuracy.Experimental comparisons with existing methods on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficacy of SMTransformer and skip-attention-based up-sampling for point cloud processing tasks, including semantic segmentation and classification. In particular, we achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation results of 73.4% mIoU on S3DIS Area 5 and 62.4% mIoU on SWAN dataset</description>

      <title>3D Object Detection from Point Cloud via Voting Step Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D object detection is a fundamental task in scene understanding. Numerous research efforts have been dedicated to better incorporate Hough voting into the 3D object detection pipeline. However, due to the noisy, cluttered, and partial nature of real 3D scans, existing voting-based methods often receive votes from the partial surfaces of individual objects together with severe noises, leading to sub-optimal detection performance. In this work, we focus on the distributional properties of point clouds and formulate the voting process as generating new points in the high-density region of the distribution of object centers. To achieve this, we propose a new method to move random 3D points toward the high-density region of the distribution by estimating the score function of the distribution with a noise conditioned score network. Specifically, we first generate a set of object center proposals to coarsely identify the high-density region of the object center distribution. To estimate the score function, we perturb the generated object center proposals by adding normalized Gaussian noise, and then jointly estimate the score function of all perturbed distributions. Finally, we generate new votes by moving random 3D points to the high-density region of the object center distribution according to the estimated score function. Extensive experiments on two large scale indoor 3D scene datasets, SUN RGB-D and ScanNet V2, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. The code will be released at https://github.com/HHrEtvP/DiffVote.</description>

      <title>Improving Image Classification Accuracy through Complementary Intra-Class and Inter-Class Mixup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MixUp and its variants, such as Manifold MixUp, have two key limitations in image classification tasks. First, they often neglect mixing within the same class (intra-class mixup), leading to an underutilization of the relationships among samples within the same class. Second, although these methods effectively enhance inter-class separability by mixing between different classes (inter-class mixup), they fall short in improving intra-class cohesion through their mixing operations, limiting their classification performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel mixup method and a comprehensive integrated solution.Our mixup approach specifically targets intra-class mixup, an aspect commonly overlooked, to strengthen intra-class cohesion-a feature not provided by current mixup techniques.For each mini-batch, our method utilizes feature representations of unaugmented original images from each class within the mini-batch to generate a single synthesized feature representation through random linear interpolation. All synthesized representations for this mini-batch are then fed into the classification and loss layers to calculate an average classification loss that can markedly enhance intra-class cohesion. Moreover, our integrated solution seamlessly combines our intra-class mixup method with an existing mixup approach such as MixUp or Manifold MixUp. This comprehensive solution incorporates inter- and intra-class mixup in a balanced manner while concurrently improving intra-class cohesion and inter-class separability. Experimental results on six public datasets demonstrate that our integrated solution achieves a 0.1% to 3.43% higher accuracy than the best of either MixUp or our intra-class mixup method, averaging a 1.16% gain. It also outperforms the better performer of either Manifold MixUp or our intra-class mixup method by 0.12% to 5.16%, with an average gain of 1.11%.</description>

      <title>Learning Decomposable and Debiased Representations via Attribute-Centric Information Bottlenecks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biased attributes, spuriously correlated with target labels in a dataset, can problematically lead to neural networks that learn improper shortcuts for classifications and limit their capabilities for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Although many debiasing approaches have been proposed to ensure correct predictions from biased datasets, few studies have considered learning latent embedding consisting of intrinsic and biased attributes that contribute to improved performance and explain how the model pays attention to attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel debiasing framework, Debiasing Global Workspace, introducing attention-based information bottlenecks for learning compositional representations of attributes without defining specific bias types. Based on our observation that learning shape-centric representation helps robust performance on OOD datasets, we adopt those abilities to learn robust and generalizable representations of decomposable latent embeddings corresponding to intrinsic and biasing attributes. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on biased datasets, along with both quantitative and qualitative analyses, to showcase our approach's efficacy in attribute-centric representation learning and its ability to differentiate between intrinsic and bias-related features.</description>

      <title>Empowering Segmentation Ability to Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can understand image-language prompts and demonstrate impressive reasoning ability. In this paper, we extend MLLMs' output by empowering MLLMs with the segmentation ability. The extended MLLMs can both output language responses to the image-language prompts and segment the regions that the complex question or query in the language prompts focuses on. To this end, the existing work, LISA, enlarges the original word embeddings with an additional segment token and fine-tunes dialogue generation and query-focused segmentation together, where the feature of the segment token is used to prompt the segment-anything model. Although they achieve superior segmentation performance, we observe that the dialogue ability decreases by a large margin compared to the original MLLMs. To maintain the original MLLMs' dialogue ability, we propose a novel MLLMs framework, coined as LLaVASeg, which leverages a chain-of-thought prompting strategy to instruct the MLLMs to segment the target region queried by the user. The MLLMs are first prompted to reason about the simple description of the target region from the complicated user query, then extract the visual attributes of the target region according to the understanding of MLLMs to the image. These visual attributes, such as color and relative locations, are utilized to prompt the downstream segmentation model. Experiments show that the proposed method keeps the original dialogue ability and equips the MLLMs' model with strong reasoning segmentation ability.

      <title>Efficient Video Diffusion Models via Content-Frame Motion-Latent Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently made great progress in generation quality, but are still limited by the high memory and computational requirements. This is because current video diffusion models often attempt to process high-dimensional videos directly. To tackle this issue, we propose content-motion latent diffusion model (CMD), a novel efficient extension of pretrained image diffusion models for video generation. Specifically, we propose an autoencoder that succinctly encodes a video as a combination of a content frame (like an image) and a low-dimensional motion latent representation. The former represents the common content, and the latter represents the underlying motion in the video, respectively. We generate the content frame by fine-tuning a pretrained image diffusion model, and we generate the motion latent representation by training a new lightweight diffusion model. A key innovation here is the design of a compact latent space that can directly utilizes a pretrained image diffusion model, which has not been done in previous latent video diffusion models. This leads to considerably better quality generation and reduced computational costs. For instance, CMD can sample a video 7.7$\times$ faster than prior approaches by generating a video of 512$\times$1024 resolution and length 16 in 3.1 seconds. Moreover, CMD achieves an FVD score of 212.7 on WebVid-10M, 27.3% better than the previous state-of-the-art of 292.4.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing Visual and Textual Embeddings for Zero-Shot Text-to-Image Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a surge of text-to-image (T2I) models and their customization methods that generate new images of a user-provided subject, current works focus on alleviating the costs incurred by a lengthy per-subject optimization. These zero-shot customization methods encode the image of a specified subject into a visual embedding which is then utilized alongside the textual embedding for diffusion guidance. The visual embedding incorporates intrinsic information about the subject, while the textual embedding provides a new, transient context. However, the existing methods often 1) are significantly affected by the input images, eg., generating images with the same pose, and 2) exhibit deterioration in the subject's identity. We first pin down the problem and show that redundant pose information in the visual embedding interferes with the textual embedding containing the desired pose information. To address this issue, we propose orthogonal visual embedding which effectively harmonizes with the given textual embedding. We also adopt the visual-only embedding and inject the subject's clear features utilizing a self-attention swap. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, which offers highly flexible zero-shot generation while effectively maintaining the subject's identity.</description>

      <title>Volumetric Environment Representation for Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires an agent to navigate through an 3D environment based on visual observations and natural language instructions. It is clear that the pivotal factor for successful navigation lies in the comprehensive scene understanding. Previous VLN agents employ monocular frameworks to extract 2D features of perspective views directly. Though straightforward, they struggle for capturing 3D geometry and semantics, leading to a partial and incomplete environment representation. To achieve a comprehensive 3D representation with fine-grained details, we introduce a Volumetric Environment Representation (VER), which voxelizes the physical world into structured 3D cells. For each cell, VER aggregates multi-view 2D features into such a unified 3D space via 2D-3D sampling. Through coarse-to-fine feature extraction and multi-task learning for VER, our agent predicts 3D occupancy, 3D room layout, and 3D bounding boxes jointly. Based on online collected VERs, our agent performs volume state estimation and builds episodic memory for predicting the next step. Experimental results show our environment representations from multi-task learning lead to evident performance gains on VLN. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across VLN benchmarks (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R).</description>

      <title>Mini-Splatting: Representing Scenes with a Constrained Number of Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the challenge of efficiently representing scenes with a constrained number of Gaussians. Our analysis shifts from traditional graphics and 2D computer vision to the perspective of point clouds, highlighting the inefficient spatial distribution of Gaussian representation as a key limitation in model performance. To address this, we introduce strategies for densification including blur split and depth reinitialization, and simplification through Gaussian binarization and sampling. These techniques reorganize the spatial positions of the Gaussians, resulting in significant improvements across various datasets and benchmarks in terms of rendering quality, resource consumption, and storage compression. Our proposed Mini-Splatting method integrates seamlessly with the original rasterization pipeline, providing a strong baseline for future research in Gaussian-Splatting-based works.</description>

      <title>Unified Static and Dynamic Network: Efficient Temporal Filtering for Video Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the activity-silent and persistent activity mechanisms in human visual perception biology, we design a Unified Static and Dynamic Network (UniSDNet), to learn the semantic association between the video and text/audio queries in a cross-modal environment for efficient video grounding. For static modeling, we devise a novel residual structure (ResMLP) to boost the global comprehensive interaction between the video segments and queries, achieving more effective semantic enhancement/supplement. For dynamic modeling, we effectively exploit three characteristics of the persistent activity mechanism in our network design for a better video context comprehension. Specifically, we construct a diffusely connected video clip graph on the basis of 2D sparse temporal masking to reflect the "short-term effect" relationship. We innovatively consider the temporal distance and relevance as the joint "auxiliary evidence clues" and design a multi-kernel Temporal Gaussian Filter to expand the context clue into high-dimensional space, simulating the "complex visual perception", and then conduct element level filtering convolution operations on neighbour clip nodes in message passing stage for finally generating and ranking the candidate proposals. Our UniSDNet is applicable to both Natural Language Video Grounding (NLVG) and Spoken Language Video Grounding (SLVG) tasks. Our UniSDNet achieves SOTA performance on three widely used datasets for NLVG, as well as three datasets for SLVG, e.g., reporting new records at 38.88% R@1,IoU@0.7 on ActivityNet Captions and 40.26% R@1,IoU@0.5 on TACoS. To facilitate this field, we collect two new datasets (Charades-STA Speech and TACoS Speech) for SLVG task. Meanwhile, the inference speed of our UniSDNet is 1.56$\times$ faster than the strong multi-query benchmark. Code is available at: https://github.com/xian-sh/UniSDNet.</description>

      <title>OTSeg: Multi-prompt Sinkhorn Attention for Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent success of CLIP has demonstrated promising results in zero-shot semantic segmentation by transferring muiltimodal knowledge to pixel-level classification. However, leveraging pre-trained CLIP knowledge to closely align text embeddings with pixel embeddings still has limitations in existing approaches. To address this issue, we propose OTSeg, a novel multimodal attention mechanism aimed at enhancing the potential of multiple text prompts for matching associated pixel embeddings. We first propose Multi-Prompts Sinkhorn (MPS) based on the Optimal Transport (OT) algorithm, which leads multiple text prompts to selectively focus on various semantic features within image pixels. Moreover, inspired by the success of Sinkformers in unimodal settings, we introduce the extension of MPS, called Multi-Prompts Sinkhorn Attention (MPSA), which effectively replaces cross-attention mechanisms within Transformer framework in multimodal settings. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that OTSeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant gains on Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation (ZS3) tasks across three benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>StyleCineGAN: Landscape Cinemagraph Generation using a Pre-trained StyleGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method that can generate cinemagraphs automatically from a still landscape image using a pre-trained StyleGAN. Inspired by the success of recent unconditional video generation, we leverage a powerful pre-trained image generator to synthesize high-quality cinemagraphs. Unlike previous approaches that mainly utilize the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN, our approach utilizes its deep feature space for both GAN inversion and cinemagraph generation. Specifically, we propose multi-scale deep feature warping (MSDFW), which warps the intermediate features of a pre-trained StyleGAN at different resolutions. By using MSDFW, the generated cinemagraphs are of high resolution and exhibit plausible looping animation. We demonstrate the superiority of our method through user studies and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art cinemagraph generation methods and a video generation method that uses a pre-trained StyleGAN.</description>

      <title>PECI-Net: Bolus segmentation from video fluoroscopic swallowing study images using preprocessing ensemble and cascaded inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bolus segmentation is crucial for the automated detection of swallowing disorders in videofluoroscopic swallowing studies (VFSS). However, it is difficult for the model to accurately segment a bolus region in a VFSS image because VFSS images are translucent, have low contrast and unclear region boundaries, and lack color information. To overcome these challenges, we propose PECI-Net, a network architecture for VFSS image analysis that combines two novel techniques: the preprocessing ensemble network (PEN) and the cascaded inference network (CIN). PEN enhances the sharpness and contrast of the VFSS image by combining multiple preprocessing algorithms in a learnable way. CIN reduces ambiguity in bolus segmentation by using context from other regions through cascaded inference. Moreover, CIN prevents undesirable side effects from unreliably segmented regions by referring to the context in an asymmetric way. In experiments, PECI-Net exhibited higher performance than four recently developed baseline models, outperforming TernausNet, the best among the baseline models, by 4.54\% and the widely used UNet by 10.83\%. The results of the ablation studies confirm that CIN and PEN are effective in improving bolus segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Unlabeled Data: A Paradigm for Cross-View Geo-Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effective utilization of unlabeled data for large-area cross-view geo-localization (CVGL), encompassing both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. Common approaches to CVGL rely on ground-satellite image pairs and employ label-driven supervised training. However, the cost of collecting precise cross-view image pairs hinders the deployment of CVGL in real-life scenarios. Without the pairs, CVGL will be more challenging to handle the significant imaging and spatial gaps between ground and satellite images. To this end, we propose an unsupervised framework including a cross-view projection to guide the model for retrieving initial pseudo-labels and a fast re-ranking mechanism to refine the pseudo-labels by leveraging the fact that ``the perfectly paired ground-satellite image is located in a unique and identical scene". The framework exhibits competitive performance compared with supervised works on three open-source benchmarks. Our code and models will be released on https://github.com/liguopeng0923/UCVGL.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Audio-Visual Segmentation with Modality Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to identify, at the pixel level, the object in a visual scene that produces a given sound. Current AVS methods rely on costly fine-grained annotations of mask-audio pairs, making them impractical for scalability. To address this, we introduce unsupervised AVS, eliminating the need for such expensive annotation. To tackle this more challenging problem, we propose an unsupervised learning method, named Modality Correspondence Alignment (MoCA), which seamlessly integrates off-the-shelf foundation models like DINO, SAM, and ImageBind. This approach leverages their knowledge complementarity and optimizes their joint usage for multi-modality association. Initially, we estimate positive and negative image pairs in the feature space. For pixel-level association, we introduce an audio-visual adapter and a novel pixel matching aggregation strategy within the image-level contrastive learning framework. This allows for a flexible connection between object appearance and audio signal at the pixel level, with tolerance to imaging variations such as translation and rotation. Extensive experiments on the AVSBench (single and multi-object splits) and AVSS datasets demonstrate that our MoCA outperforms strongly designed baseline methods and approaches supervised counterparts, particularly in complex scenarios with multiple auditory objects. Notably when comparing mIoU, MoCA achieves a substantial improvement over baselines in both the AVSBench (S4: +17.24%; MS3: +67.64%) and AVSS (+19.23%) audio-visual segmentation challenges.</description>

      <title>Toward Multi-class Anomaly Detection: Exploring Class-aware Unified Model against Inter-class Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of high usability in single-class anomaly detection models, recent academic research has become concerned about the more complex multi-class anomaly detection. Although several papers have designed unified models for this task, they often overlook the utility of class labels, a potent tool for mitigating inter-class interference. To address this issue, we introduce a Multi-class Implicit Neural representation Transformer for unified Anomaly Detection (MINT-AD), which leverages the fine-grained category information in the training stage. By learning the multi-class distributions, the model generates class-aware query embeddings for the transformer decoder, mitigating inter-class interference within the reconstruction model. Utilizing such an implicit neural representation network, MINT-AD can project category and position information into a feature embedding space, further supervised by classification and prior probability loss functions. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that MINT-AD outperforms existing unified training models.</description>

      <title>SoftPatch: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) algorithms perform well in academic datasets, their performance is limited in practical application due to the ideal experimental setting of clean training data. Training with noisy data is an inevitable problem in real-world anomaly detection but is seldom discussed. This paper considers label-level noise in image sensory anomaly detection for the first time. To solve this problem, we proposed a memory-based unsupervised AD method, SoftPatch, which efficiently denoises the data at the patch level. Noise discriminators are utilized to generate outlier scores for patch-level noise elimination before coreset construction. The scores are then stored in the memory bank to soften the anomaly detection boundary. Compared with existing methods, SoftPatch maintains a strong modeling ability of normal data and alleviates the overconfidence problem in coreset. Comprehensive experiments in various noise scenes demonstrate that SoftPatch outperforms the state-of-the-art AD methods on the MVTecAD and BTAD benchmarks and is comparable to those methods under the setting without noise.</description>

      <title>Weak Supervision with Arbitrary Single Frame for Micro- and Macro-expression Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frame-level micro- and macro-expression spotting methods require time-consuming frame-by-frame observation during annotation. Meanwhile, video-level spotting lacks sufficient information about the location and number of expressions during training, resulting in significantly inferior performance compared with fully-supervised spotting. To bridge this gap, we propose a point-level weakly-supervised expression spotting (PWES) framework, where each expression requires to be annotated with only one random frame (i.e., a point). To mitigate the issue of sparse label distribution, the prevailing solution is pseudo-label mining, which, however, introduces new problems: localizing contextual background snippets results in inaccurate boundaries and discarding foreground snippets leads to fragmentary predictions. Therefore, we design the strategies of multi-refined pseudo label generation (MPLG) and distribution-guided feature contrastive learning (DFCL) to address these problems. Specifically, MPLG generates more reliable pseudo labels by merging class-specific probabilities, attention scores, fused features, and point-level labels. DFCL is utilized to enhance feature similarity for the same categories and feature variability for different categories while capturing global representations across the entire datasets. Extensive experiments on the CAS(ME)^2, CAS(ME)^3, and SAMM-LV datasets demonstrate PWES achieves promising performance comparable to that of recent fully-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3D Gaussian splatting method has drawn a lot of attention, thanks to its high performance in training and high quality of the rendered image. However, it uses anisotropic Gaussian kernels to represent the scene. Although such anisotropic kernels have advantages in representing the geometry, they lead to difficulties in terms of computation, such as splitting or merging two kernels. In this paper, we propose to use isotropic Gaussian kernels to avoid such difficulties in the computation, leading to a higher performance method. The experiments confirm that the proposed method is about {\bf 100X} faster without losing the geometry representation accuracy. The proposed method can be applied in a large range applications where the radiance field is needed, such as 3D reconstruction, view synthesis, and dynamic object modeling.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Portrait Stylization with Skin-Tone Awareness and Nudity Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portrait stylization is a challenging task involving the transformation of an input portrait image into a specific style while preserving its inherent characteristics. The recent introduction of Stable Diffusion (SD) has significantly improved the quality of outcomes in this field. However, a practical stylization framework that can effectively filter harmful input content and preserve the distinct characteristics of an input, such as skin-tone, while maintaining the quality of stylization remains lacking. These challenges have hindered the wide deployment of such a framework. To address these issues, this study proposes a portrait stylization framework that incorporates a nudity content identification module (NCIM) and a skin-tone-aware portrait stylization module (STAPSM). In experiments, NCIM showed good performance in enhancing explicit content filtering, and STAPSM accurately represented a diverse range of skin tones. Our proposed framework has been successfully deployed in practice, and it has effectively satisfied critical requirements of real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Scene-Graph ViT: End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Visual Relationship Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual relationship detection aims to identify objects and their relationships in images. Prior methods approach this task by adding separate relationship modules or decoders to existing object detection architectures. This separation increases complexity and hinders end-to-end training, which limits performance. We propose a simple and highly efficient decoder-free architecture for open-vocabulary visual relationship detection. Our model consists of a Transformer-based image encoder that represents objects as tokens and models their relationships implicitly. To extract relationship information, we introduce an attention mechanism that selects object pairs likely to form a relationship. We provide a single-stage recipe to train this model on a mixture of object and relationship detection data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art relationship detection performance on Visual Genome and on the large-vocabulary GQA benchmark at real-time inference speeds. We provide analyses of zero-shot performance, ablations, and real-world qualitative examples.</description>

      <title>Zero123-6D: Zero-shot Novel View Synthesis for RGB Category-level 6D Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the pose of objects through vision is essential to make robotic platforms interact with the environment. Yet, it presents many challenges, often related to the lack of flexibility and generalizability of state-of-the-art solutions. Diffusion models are a cutting-edge neural architecture transforming 2D and 3D computer vision, outlining remarkable performances in zero-shot novel-view synthesis. Such a use case is particularly intriguing for reconstructing 3D objects. However, localizing objects in unstructured environments is rather unexplored. To this end, this work presents Zero123-6D to demonstrate the utility of Diffusion Model-based novel-view-synthesizers in enhancing RGB 6D pose estimation at category-level by integrating them with feature extraction techniques. The outlined method exploits such a novel view synthesizer to expand a sparse set of RGB-only reference views for the zero-shot 6D pose estimation task. Experiments are quantitatively analyzed on the CO3D dataset, showcasing increased performance over baselines, a substantial reduction in data requirements, and the removal of the necessity of depth information.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Historical Image Retrieval with Compositional Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analyzing vast amounts of digitally stored historical image data, existing content-based retrieval methods often overlook significant non-semantic information, limiting their effectiveness for flexible exploration across varied themes. To broaden the applicability of image retrieval methods for diverse purposes and uncover more general patterns, we innovatively introduce a crucial factor from computational aesthetics, namely image composition, into this topic. By explicitly integrating composition-related information extracted by CNN into the designed retrieval model, our method considers both the image's composition rules and semantic information. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the image retrieval network guided by composition information outperforms those relying solely on content information, facilitating the identification of images in databases closer to the target image in human perception.

      <title>Open-Vocabulary Attention Maps with Token Optimization for Semantic Segmentation in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models represent a new paradigm in text-to-image generation. Beyond generating high-quality images from text prompts, models such as Stable Diffusion have been successfully extended to the joint generation of semantic segmentation pseudo-masks. However, current extensions primarily rely on extracting attentions linked to prompt words used for image synthesis. This approach limits the generation of segmentation masks derived from word tokens not contained in the text prompt. In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Attention Maps (OVAM)-a training-free method for text-to-image diffusion models that enables the generation of attention maps for any word. In addition, we propose a lightweight optimization process based on OVAM for finding tokens that generate accurate attention maps for an object class with a single annotation. We evaluate these tokens within existing state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion extensions. The best-performing model improves its mIoU from 52.1 to 86.6 for the synthetic images' pseudo-masks, demonstrating that our optimized tokens are an efficient way to improve the performance of existing methods without architectural changes or retraining.</description>

      <title>HySim: An Efficient Hybrid Similarity Measure for Patch Matching in Image Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inpainting, for filling missing image regions, is a crucial task in various applications, such as medical imaging and remote sensing. Trending data-driven approaches efficiency, for image inpainting, often requires extensive data preprocessing. In this sense, there is still a need for model-driven approaches in case of application constrained with data availability and quality, especially for those related for time series forecasting using image inpainting techniques. This paper proposes an improved modeldriven approach relying on patch-based techniques. Our approach deviates from the standard Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) similarity measure by introducing a Hybrid Similarity (HySim), which combines both strengths of Chebychev and Minkowski distances. This hybridization enhances patch selection, leading to high-quality inpainting results with reduced mismatch errors. Experimental results proved the effectiveness of our approach against other model-driven techniques, such as diffusion or patch-based approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving visually pleasing restorations.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Attention-based Deep Network via Multi-Scale Feature Fusion for Multi-View Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their variations have shown effectiveness in facial expression recognition (FER). However, they face challenges when dealing with high computational complexity and multi-view head poses in real-world scenarios. We introduce a lightweight attentional network incorporating multi-scale feature fusion (LANMSFF) to tackle these issues. For the first challenge, we have carefully designed a lightweight fully convolutional network (FCN). We address the second challenge by presenting two novel components, namely mass attention (MassAtt) and point wise feature selection (PWFS) blocks. The MassAtt block simultaneously generates channel and spatial attention maps to recalibrate feature maps by emphasizing important features while suppressing irrelevant ones. On the other hand, the PWFS block employs a feature selection mechanism that discards less meaningful features prior to the fusion process. This mechanism distinguishes it from previous methods that directly fuse multi-scale features. Our proposed approach achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art methods in terms of parameter counts and robustness to pose variation, with accuracy rates of 90.77% on KDEF, 70.44% on FER-2013, and 86.96% on FERPlus datasets. The code for LANMSFF is available at https://github.com/AE-1129/LANMSFF.</description>

      <title>CFPL-FAS: Class Free Prompt Learning for Generalizable Face Anti-spoofing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) based Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) aims to improve the model's performance on unseen domains. Existing methods either rely on domain labels to align domain-invariant feature spaces, or disentangle generalizable features from the whole sample, which inevitably lead to the distortion of semantic feature structures and achieve limited generalization. In this work, we make use of large-scale VLMs like CLIP and leverage the textual feature to dynamically adjust the classifier's weights for exploring generalizable visual features. Specifically, we propose a novel Class Free Prompt Learning (CFPL) paradigm for DG FAS, which utilizes two lightweight transformers, namely Content Q-Former (CQF) and Style Q-Former (SQF), to learn the different semantic prompts conditioned on content and style features by using a set of learnable query vectors, respectively. Thus, the generalizable prompt can be learned by two improvements: (1) A Prompt-Text Matched (PTM) supervision is introduced to ensure CQF learns visual representation that is most informative of the content description. (2) A Diversified Style Prompt (DSP) technology is proposed to diversify the learning of style prompts by mixing feature statistics between instance-specific styles. Finally, the learned text features modulate visual features to generalization through the designed Prompt Modulation (PM). Extensive experiments show that the CFPL is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several cross-domain datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving model robustness in case of corrupted images is among the key challenges to enable robust vision systems on smart devices, such as robotic agents. Particularly, robust test-time performance is imperative for most of the applications. This paper presents a novel approach to improve robustness of any classification model, especially on severely corrupted images. Our method (FROST) employs high-frequency features to detect input image corruption type, and select layer-wise feature normalization statistics. FROST provides the state-of-the-art results for different models and datasets, outperforming competitors on ImageNet-C by up to 37.1% relative gain, improving baseline of 40.9% mCE on severe corruptions.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Information Fusion: Concentric Dual Fusion Attention Based Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of digital pathology, multi-magnification Multiple Instance Learning (multi-mag MIL) has proven effective in leveraging the hierarchical structure of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to reduce information loss and redundant data. However, current methods fall short in bridging the domain gap between pretrained models and medical imaging, and often fail to account for spatial relationships across different magnifications. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Concentric Dual Fusion Attention-MIL (CDFA-MIL) framework,which innovatively combines point-to-area feature-colum attention and point-to-point concentric-row attention using concentric patch. This approach is designed to effectively fuse correlated information, enhancing feature representation and providing stronger correlation guidance for WSI analysis. CDFA-MIL distinguishes itself by offering a robust fusion strategy that leads to superior WSI recognition. Its application has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly surpassing existing MIL methods in accuracy and F1 scores on prominent datasets like Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC. Specifically, CDFA-MIL achieved an average accuracy and F1-score of 93.7\% and 94.1\% respectively on these datasets, marking a notable advancement over traditional MIL approaches.</description>

      <title>On the Concept Trustworthiness in Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which break down the reasoning process into the input-to-concept mapping and the concept-to-label prediction, have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable interpretability achieved by the interpretable concept bottleneck. However, despite the transparency of the concept-to-label prediction, the mapping from the input to the intermediate concept remains a black box, giving rise to concerns about the trustworthiness of the learned concepts (i.e., these concepts may be predicted based on spurious cues). The issue of concept untrustworthiness greatly hampers the interpretability of CBMs, thereby hindering their further advancement. To conduct a comprehensive analysis on this issue, in this study we establish a benchmark to assess the trustworthiness of concepts in CBMs. A pioneering metric, referred to as concept trustworthiness score, is proposed to gauge whether the concepts are derived from relevant regions. Additionally, an enhanced CBM is introduced, enabling concept predictions to be made specifically from distinct parts of the feature map, thereby facilitating the exploration of their related regions. Besides, we introduce three modules, namely the cross-layer alignment (CLA) module, the cross-image alignment (CIA) module, and the prediction alignment (PA) module, to further enhance the concept trustworthiness within the elaborated CBM. The experiments on five datasets across ten architectures demonstrate that without using any concept localization annotations during training, our model improves the concept trustworthiness by a large margin, meanwhile achieving superior accuracy to the state-of-the-arts. Our code is available at https://github.com/hqhQAQ/ProtoCBM.</description>

      <title>Annotation-Efficient Polyp Segmentation via Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques have proven effective in polyp segmentation tasks when provided with sufficient pixel-wise labeled data. However, the high cost of manual annotation has created a bottleneck for model generalization. To minimize annotation costs, we propose a deep active learning framework for annotation-efficient polyp segmentation. In practice, we measure the uncertainty of each sample by examining the similarity between features masked by the prediction map of the polyp and the background area. Since the segmentation model tends to perform weak in samples with indistinguishable features of foreground and background areas, uncertainty sampling facilitates the fitting of under-learning data. Furthermore, clustering image-level features weighted by uncertainty identify samples that are both uncertain and representative. To enhance the selectivity of the active selection strategy, we propose a novel unsupervised feature discrepancy learning mechanism. The selection strategy and feature optimization work in tandem to achieve optimal performance with a limited annotation budget. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance compared to other competitors on both a public dataset and a large-scale in-house dataset.</description>

      <title>LDTR: Transformer-based Lane Detection with Anchor-chain Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in lane detection methods, scenarios with limited- or no-visual-clue of lanes due to factors such as lighting conditions and occlusion remain challenging and crucial for automated driving. Moreover, current lane representations require complex post-processing and struggle with specific instances. Inspired by the DETR architecture, we propose LDTR, a transformer-based model to address these issues. Lanes are modeled with a novel anchor-chain, regarding a lane as a whole from the beginning, which enables LDTR to handle special lanes inherently. To enhance lane instance perception, LDTR incorporates a novel multi-referenced deformable attention module to distribute attention around the object. Additionally, LDTR incorporates two line IoU algorithms to improve convergence efficiency and employs a Gaussian heatmap auxiliary branch to enhance model representation capability during training. To evaluate lane detection models, we rely on Frechet distance, parameterized F1-score, and additional synthetic metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that LDTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on well-known datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral (HS) imagery in agriculture is becoming increasingly common. These images have the advantage of higher spectral resolution. Advanced spectral processing techniques are required to unlock the information potential in these HS images. The present paper introduces a method rooted in multivariate statistics designed to detect parasitic Varroa destructor mites on the body of western honey bee Apis mellifera, enabling easier and continuous monitoring of the bee hives. The methodology explores unsupervised (K-means++) and recently developed supervised (Kernel Flows - Partial Least-Squares, KF-PLS) methods for parasitic identification. Additionally, in light of the emergence of custom-band multispectral cameras, the present research outlines a strategy for identifying the specific wavelengths necessary for effective bee-mite separation, suitable for implementation in a custom-band camera. Illustrated with a real-case dataset, our findings demonstrate that as few as four spectral bands are sufficient for accurate parasite identification.</description>

      <title>Less but Better: Enabling Generalized Zero-shot Learning Towards Unseen Domains by Intrinsic Learning from Redundant LLM Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) focuses on recognizing seen and unseen classes against domain shift problem (DSP) where data of unseen classes may be misclassified as seen classes. However, existing GZSL is still limited to seen domains. In the current work, we pioneer cross-domain GZSL (CDGZSL) which addresses GZSL towards unseen domains. Different from existing GZSL methods which alleviate DSP by generating features of unseen classes with semantics, CDGZSL needs to construct a common feature space across domains and acquire the corresponding intrinsic semantics shared among domains to transfer from seen to unseen domains. Considering the information asymmetry problem caused by redundant class semantics annotated with large language models (LLMs), we present Meta Domain Alignment Semantic Refinement (MDASR). Technically, MDASR consists of two parts: Inter-class Similarity Alignment (ISA), which eliminates the non-intrinsic semantics not shared across all domains under the guidance of inter-class feature relationships, and Unseen-class Meta Generation (UMG), which preserves intrinsic semantics to maintain connectivity between seen and unseen classes by simulating feature generation. MDASR effectively aligns the redundant semantic space with the common feature space, mitigating the information asymmetry in CDGZSL. The effectiveness of MDASR is demonstrated on the Office-Home and Mini-DomainNet, and we have shared the LLM-based semantics for these datasets as the benchmark.</description>

      <title>SurroundSDF: Implicit 3D Scene Understanding Based on Signed Distance Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-centric 3D environment understanding is both vital and challenging for autonomous driving systems. Recently, object-free methods have attracted considerable attention. Such methods perceive the world by predicting the semantics of discrete voxel grids but fail to construct continuous and accurate obstacle surfaces. To this end, in this paper, we propose SurroundSDF to implicitly predict the signed distance field (SDF) and semantic field for the continuous perception from surround images. Specifically, we introduce a query-based approach and utilize SDF constrained by the Eikonal formulation to accurately describe the surfaces of obstacles. Furthermore, considering the absence of precise SDF ground truth, we propose a novel weakly supervised paradigm for SDF, referred to as the Sandwich Eikonal formulation, which emphasizes applying correct and dense constraints on both sides of the surface, thereby enhancing the perceptual accuracy of the surface. Experiments suggest that our method achieves SOTA for both occupancy prediction and 3D scene reconstruction tasks on the nuScenes dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a novel method for unsupervised controllable video generation. Once trained on a dataset of unannotated videos, at inference our model is capable of both composing scenes of predefined object parts and animating them in a plausible and controlled way. This is achieved by conditioning video generation on a randomly selected subset of local pre-trained self-supervised features during training. We call our model CAGE for visual Composition and Animation for video GEneration. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate capabilities of CAGE in various settings.

      <description>arXiv:2403.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for generating diverse visual content, including ambiguous images, panorama images, mesh textures, and Gaussian splat textures, by synchronizing multiple diffusion processes. We present exhaustive investigation into all possible scenarios for synchronizing multiple diffusion processes through a canonical space and analyze their characteristics across applications. In doing so, we reveal a previously unexplored case: averaging the outputs of Tweedie's formula while conducting denoising in multiple instance spaces. This case also provides the best quality with the widest applicability to downstream tasks. We name this case SyncTweedies. In our experiments generating visual content aforementioned, we demonstrate the superior quality of generation by SyncTweedies compared to other synchronization methods, optimization-based and iterative-update-based methods.</description>

      <title>InfNeRF: Towards Infinite Scale NeRF Rendering with O(log n) Space Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional mesh-based Level of Detail (LoD) technique, exemplified by applications such as Google Earth and many game engines, exhibits the capability to holistically represent a large scene even the Earth, and achieves rendering with a space complexity of O(log n). This constrained data requirement not only enhances rendering efficiency but also facilitates dynamic data fetching, thereby enabling a seamless 3D navigation experience for users. In this work, we extend this proven LoD technique to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by introducing an octree structure to represent the scenes in different scales. This innovative approach provides a mathematically simple and elegant representation with a rendering space complexity of O(log n), aligned with the efficiency of mesh-based LoD techniques. We also present a novel training strategy that maintains a complexity of O(n). This strategy allows for parallel training with minimal overhead, ensuring the scalability and efficiency of our proposed method.

      <title>Tensor network compressibility of convolutional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent one of the most widely used neural network architectures, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks. Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy, their size can be effectively reduced by "tensorization" while maintaining accuracy. Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with compact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or quantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly training the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards low-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the accuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution kernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we truncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50 pre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We found that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be truncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but not in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation compression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how information is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated models could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs of re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of convolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Our results can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively.</description>

      <title>A Bag of Tricks for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bag of tricks framework for few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL), which is a challenging form of continual learning that involves continuous adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. FSCIL requires both stability and adaptability, i.e., preserving proficiency in previously learned tasks while learning new ones. Our proposed bag of tricks brings together eight key and highly influential techniques that improve stability, adaptability, and overall performance under a unified framework for FSCIL. We organize these tricks into three categories: stability tricks, adaptability tricks, and training tricks. Stability tricks aim to mitigate the forgetting of previously learned classes by enhancing the separation between the embeddings of learned classes and minimizing interference when learning new ones. On the other hand, adaptability tricks focus on the effective learning of new classes. Finally, training tricks improve the overall performance without compromising stability or adaptability. We perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, CIFAR-100, CUB-200, and miniIMageNet, to evaluate the impact of our proposed framework. Our detailed analysis shows that our approach substantially improves both stability and adaptability, establishing a new state-of-the-art by outperforming prior works in the area. We believe our method provides a go-to solution and establishes a robust baseline for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Pensieve: Retrospect-then-Compare Mitigates Visual Hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable success across various vision-language tasks. However, they suffer from visual hallucination, where the generated responses diverge from the provided image. Are MLLMs completely oblivious to accurate visual cues when they hallucinate? Our investigation reveals that the visual branch may simultaneously advocate both accurate and non-existent content. To address this issue, we propose Pensieve, a training-free method inspired by our observation that analogous visual hallucinations can arise among images sharing common semantic and appearance characteristics. During inference, Pensieve enables MLLMs to retrospect relevant images as references and compare them with the test image. This paradigm assists MLLMs in downgrading hallucinatory content mistakenly supported by the visual input. Experiments on Whoops, MME, POPE, and LLaVA Bench demonstrate the efficacy of Pensieve in mitigating visual hallucination, surpassing other advanced decoding strategies. Additionally, Pensieve aids MLLMs in identifying details in the image and enhancing the specificity of image descriptions.</description>

      <title>GLC++: Source-Free Universal Domain Adaptation through Global-Local Clustering and Contrastive Affinity Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often exhibit sub-optimal performance under covariate and category shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) presents a promising solution to this dilemma, yet most SFDA approaches are restricted to closed-set scenarios. In this paper, we explore Source-Free Universal Domain Adaptation (SF-UniDA) aiming to accurately classify "known" data belonging to common categories and segregate them from target-private "unknown" data. We propose a novel Global and Local Clustering (GLC) technique, which comprises an adaptive one-vs-all global clustering algorithm to discern between target classes, complemented by a local k-NN clustering strategy to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the effectiveness, the inherent closed-set source architecture leads to uniform treatment of "unknown" data, impeding the identification of distinct "unknown" categories. To address this, we evolve GLC to GLC++, integrating a contrastive affinity learning strategy. We examine the superiority of GLC and GLC++ across multiple benchmarks and category shift scenarios. Remarkably, in the most challenging open-partial-set scenarios, GLC and GLC++ surpass GATE by 16.7% and 18.6% in H-score on VisDA, respectively. GLC++ enhances the novel category clustering accuracy of GLC by 4.3% in open-set scenarios on Office-Home. Furthermore, the introduced contrastive learning strategy not only enhances GLC but also significantly facilitates existing methodologies.</description>

      <title>CombiNeRF: A Combination of Regularization Techniques for Few-Shot Neural Radiance Field View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results for novel view synthesis when a sufficiently large amount of views are available. When dealing with few-shot settings, i.e. with a small set of input views, the training could overfit those views, leading to artifacts and geometric and chromatic inconsistencies in the resulting rendering. Regularization is a valid solution that helps NeRF generalization. On the other hand, each of the most recent NeRF regularization techniques aim to mitigate a specific rendering problem. Starting from this observation, in this paper we propose CombiNeRF, a framework that synergically combines several regularization techniques, some of them novel, in order to unify the benefits of each. In particular, we regularize single and neighboring rays distributions and we add a smoothness term to regularize near geometries. After these geometric approaches, we propose to exploit Lipschitz regularization to both NeRF density and color networks and to use encoding masks for input features regularization. We show that CombiNeRF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with few-shot settings in several publicly available datasets. We also present an ablation study on the LLFF and NeRF-Synthetic datasets that support the choices made. We release with this paper the open-source implementation of our framework.</description>

      <title>OA-CNNs: Omni-Adaptive Sparse CNNs for 3D Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The booming of 3D recognition in the 2020s began with the introduction of point cloud transformers. They quickly overwhelmed sparse CNNs and became state-of-the-art models, especially in 3D semantic segmentation. However, sparse CNNs are still valuable networks, due to their efficiency treasure, and ease of application. In this work, we reexamine the design distinctions and test the limits of what a sparse CNN can achieve. We discover that the key credit to the performance difference is adaptivity. Specifically, we propose two key components, i.e., adaptive receptive fields (spatially) and adaptive relation, to bridge the gap. This exploration led to the creation of Omni-Adaptive 3D CNNs (OA-CNNs), a family of networks that integrates a lightweight module to greatly enhance the adaptivity of sparse CNNs at minimal computational cost. Without any self-attention modules, OA-CNNs favorably surpass point transformers in terms of accuracy in both indoor and outdoor scenes, with much less latency and memory cost. Notably, it achieves 76.1%, 78.9%, and 70.6% mIoU on ScanNet v2, nuScenes, and SemanticKITTI validation benchmarks respectively, while maintaining at most 5x better speed than transformer counterparts. This revelation highlights the potential of pure sparse CNNs to outperform transformer-related networks.</description>

      <title>Style-Extracting Diffusion Models for Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based image generation has seen significant advancements with diffusion models, notably improving the quality of generated images. Despite these developments, generating images with unseen characteristics beneficial for downstream tasks has received limited attention. To bridge this gap, we propose Style-Extracting Diffusion Models, featuring two conditioning mechanisms. Specifically, we utilize 1) a style conditioning mechanism which allows to inject style information of previously unseen images during image generation and 2) a content conditioning which can be targeted to a downstream task, e.g., layout for segmentation. We introduce a trainable style encoder to extract style information from images, and an aggregation block that merges style information from multiple style inputs. This architecture enables the generation of images with unseen styles in a zero-shot manner, by leveraging styles from unseen images, resulting in more diverse generations. In this work, we use the image layout as target condition and first show the capability of our method on a natural image dataset as a proof-of-concept. We further demonstrate its versatility in histopathology, where we combine prior knowledge about tissue composition and unannotated data to create diverse synthetic images with known layouts. This allows us to generate additional synthetic data to train a segmentation network in a semi-supervised fashion. We verify the added value of the generated images by showing improved segmentation results and lower performance variability between patients when synthetic images are included during segmentation training. Our code will be made publicly available at [LINK].</description>

      <title>Ranking Distillation for Open-Ended Video Question Answering with Insufficient Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on open-ended video question answering, which aims to find the correct answers from a large answer set in response to a video-related question. This is essentially a multi-label classification task, since a question may have multiple answers. However, due to annotation costs, the labels in existing benchmarks are always extremely insufficient, typically one answer per question. As a result, existing works tend to directly treat all the unlabeled answers as negative labels, leading to limited ability for generalization. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective ranking distillation framework (RADI) to mitigate this problem without additional manual annotation. RADI employs a teacher model trained with incomplete labels to generate rankings for potential answers, which contain rich knowledge about label priority as well as label-associated visual cues, thereby enriching the insufficient labeling information. To avoid overconfidence in the imperfect teacher model, we further present two robust and parameter-free ranking distillation approaches: a pairwise approach which introduces adaptive soft margins to dynamically refine the optimization constraints on various pairwise rankings, and a listwise approach which adopts sampling-based partial listwise learning to resist the bias in teacher ranking. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks consistently show that both our pairwise and listwise RADIs outperform state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods on the insufficient labeling problem.</description>

      <title>Biased Binary Attribute Classifiers Ignore the Majority Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To visualize the regions of interest that classifiers base their decisions on, different Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods have been developed. However, all of these techniques target categorical classifiers only, though most real-world tasks are binary classification. In this paper, we extend gradient-based CAM techniques to work with binary classifiers and visualize the active regions for binary facial attribute classifiers. When training an unbalanced binary classifier on an imbalanced dataset, it is well-known that the majority class, i.e. the class with many training samples, is mostly predicted much better than minority class with few training instances. In our experiments on the CelebA dataset, we verify these results, when training an unbalanced classifier to extract 40 facial attributes simultaneously. One would expect that the biased classifier has learned to extract features mainly for the majority classes and that the proportional energy of the activations mainly reside in certain specific regions of the image where the attribute is located. However, we find very little regular activation for samples of majority classes, while the active regions for minority classes seem mostly reasonable and overlap with our expectations. These results suggest that biased classifiers mainly rely on bias activation for majority classes. When training a balanced classifier on the imbalanced data by employing attribute-specific class weights, majority and minority classes are classified similarly well and show expected activations for almost all attributes</description>

      <title>Raw Instinct: Trust Your Classifiers and Skip the Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using RAW-images in computer vision problems is surprisingly underexplored considering that converting from RAW to RGB does not introduce any new capture information. In this paper, we show that a sufficiently advanced classifier can yield equivalent results on RAW input compared to RGB and present a new public dataset consisting of RAW images and the corresponding converted RGB images. Classifying images directly from RAW is attractive, as it allows for skipping the conversion to RGB, lowering computation time significantly. Two CNN classifiers are used to classify the images in both formats, confirming that classification performance can indeed be preserved. We furthermore show that the total computation time from RAW image data to classification results for RAW images can be up to 8.46 times faster than RGB. These results contribute to the evidence found in related works, that using RAW images as direct input to computer vision algorithms looks very promising.</description>

      <title>RoDLA: Benchmarking the Robustness of Document Layout Analysis Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Before developing a Document Layout Analysis (DLA) model in real-world applications, conducting comprehensive robustness testing is essential. However, the robustness of DLA models remains underexplored in the literature. To address this, we are the first to introduce a robustness benchmark for DLA models, which includes 450K document images of three datasets. To cover realistic corruptions, we propose a perturbation taxonomy with 36 common document perturbations inspired by real-world document processing. Additionally, to better understand document perturbation impacts, we propose two metrics, Mean Perturbation Effect (mPE) for perturbation assessment and Mean Robustness Degradation (mRD) for robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce a self-titled model, i.e., Robust Document Layout Analyzer (RoDLA), which improves attention mechanisms to boost extraction of robust features. Experiments on the proposed benchmarks (PubLayNet-P, DocLayNet-P, and M$^6$Doc-P) demonstrate that RoDLA obtains state-of-the-art mRD scores of 115.7, 135.4, and 150.4, respectively. Compared to previous methods, RoDLA achieves notable improvements in mAP of +3.8%, +7.1% and +12.1%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring 3D Human Pose Estimation and Forecasting from the Robot's Perspective: The HARPER Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce HARPER, a novel dataset for 3D body pose estimation and forecast in dyadic interactions between users and \spot, the quadruped robot manufactured by Boston Dynamics. The key-novelty is the focus on the robot's perspective, i.e., on the data captured by the robot's sensors. These make 3D body pose analysis challenging because being close to the ground captures humans only partially. The scenario underlying HARPER includes 15 actions, of which 10 involve physical contact between the robot and users. The Corpus contains not only the recordings of the built-in stereo cameras of Spot, but also those of a 6-camera OptiTrack system (all recordings are synchronized). This leads to ground-truth skeletal representations with a precision lower than a millimeter. In addition, the Corpus includes reproducible benchmarks on 3D Human Pose Estimation, Human Pose Forecasting, and Collision Prediction, all based on publicly available baseline approaches. This enables future HARPER users to rigorously compare their results with those we provide in this work.</description>

      <title>AnyV2V: A Plug-and-Play Framework For Any Video-to-Video Editing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-to-video editing involves editing a source video along with additional control (such as text prompts, subjects, or styles) to generate a new video that aligns with the source video and the provided control. Traditional methods have been constrained to certain editing types, limiting their ability to meet the wide range of user demands. In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel training-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary steps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g. InstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an existing image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion and feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing image editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks. Beyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support novel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer, subject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by previous methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing image-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature injection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source video. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the previous best approach by 35\% on prompt alignment, and 25\% on human preference. On the three novel tasks, we show that AnyV2V also achieves a high success rate. We believe AnyV2V will continue to thrive due to its ability to seamlessly integrate the fast-evolving image editing methods. Such compatibility can help AnyV2V to increase its versatility to cater to diverse user demands.</description>

      <title>DesignEdit: Multi-Layered Latent Decomposition and Fusion for Unified &amp; Accurate Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, how to achieve precise image editing has attracted increasing attention, especially given the remarkable success of text-to-image generation models. To unify various spatial-aware image editing abilities into one framework, we adopt the concept of layers from the design domain to manipulate objects flexibly with various operations. The key insight is to transform the spatial-aware image editing task into a combination of two sub-tasks: multi-layered latent decomposition and multi-layered latent fusion. First, we segment the latent representations of the source images into multiple layers, which include several object layers and one incomplete background layer that necessitates reliable inpainting. To avoid extra tuning, we further explore the inner inpainting ability within the self-attention mechanism. We introduce a key-masking self-attention scheme that can propagate the surrounding context information into the masked region while mitigating its impact on the regions outside the mask. Second, we propose an instruction-guided latent fusion that pastes the multi-layered latent representations onto a canvas latent. We also introduce an artifact suppression scheme in the latent space to enhance the inpainting quality. Due to the inherent modular advantages of such multi-layered representations, we can achieve accurate image editing, and we demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses the latest spatial editing methods, including Self-Guidance and DiffEditor. Last, we show that our approach is a unified framework that supports various accurate image editing tasks on more than six different editing tasks.</description>

      <title>Adversary-Robust Graph-Based Learning of WSIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks is crucial, especially in critical domains like healthcare where significant financial interests heighten the risk of such attacks. Whole slide images (WSIs) are high-resolution, digitized versions of tissue samples mounted on glass slides, scanned using sophisticated imaging equipment. The digital analysis of WSIs presents unique challenges due to their gigapixel size and multi-resolution storage format. In this work, we aim at improving the robustness of cancer Gleason grading classification systems against adversarial attacks, addressing challenges at both the image and graph levels. As regards the proposed algorithm, we develop a novel and innovative graph-based model which utilizes GNN to extract features from the graph representation of WSIs. A denoising module, along with a pooling layer is incorporated to manage the impact of adversarial attacks on the WSIs. The process concludes with a transformer module that classifies various grades of prostate cancer based on the processed data. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a comparative analysis using two scenarios. Initially, we trained and tested the model without the denoiser using WSIs that had not been exposed to any attack. We then introduced a range of attacks at either the image or graph level and processed them through the proposed network. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of accuracy and kappa scores. The results from this comparison showed a significant improvement in cancer diagnosis accuracy, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method in handling adversarial challenges in the context of medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Learning to Project for Cross-Task Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional knowledge distillation (KD) relies on a proficient teacher trained on the target task, which is not always available. In this setting, cross-task distillation can be used, enabling the use of any teacher model trained on a different task. However, many KD methods prove ineffective when applied to this cross-task setting. To address this limitation, we propose a simple modification: the use of an inverted projection. We show that this drop-in replacement for a standard projector is effective by learning to disregard any task-specific features which might degrade the student's performance. We find that this simple modification is sufficient for extending many KD methods to the cross-task setting, where the teacher and student tasks can be very different. In doing so, we obtain up to a 1.9% improvement in the cross-task setting compared to the traditional projection, at no additional cost. Our method can obtain significant performance improvements (up to 7%) when using even a randomly-initialised teacher on various tasks such as depth estimation, image translation, and semantic segmentation, despite the lack of any learned knowledge to transfer. To provide conceptual and analytical insights into this result, we show that using an inverted projection allows the distillation loss to be decomposed into a knowledge transfer and a spectral regularisation component. Through this analysis we are additionally able to propose a novel regularisation loss that allows teacher-free distillation, enabling performance improvements of up to 8.57% on ImageNet with no additional training costs.</description>

      <title>MULDE: Multiscale Log-Density Estimation via Denoising Score Matching for Video Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to video anomaly detection: we treat feature vectors extracted from videos as realizations of a random variable with a fixed distribution and model this distribution with a neural network. This lets us estimate the likelihood of test videos and detect video anomalies by thresholding the likelihood estimates. We train our video anomaly detector using a modification of denoising score matching, a method that injects training data with noise to facilitate modeling its distribution. To eliminate hyperparameter selection, we model the distribution of noisy video features across a range of noise levels and introduce a regularizer that tends to align the models for different levels of noise. At test time, we combine anomaly indications at multiple noise scales with a Gaussian mixture model. Running our video anomaly detector induces minimal delays as inference requires merely extracting the features and forward-propagating them through a shallow neural network and a Gaussian mixture model. Our experiments on five popular video anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, both in the object-centric and in the frame-centric setup.</description>

      <title>View-decoupled Transformer for Person Re-identification under Aerial-ground Camera Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing person re-identification methods have achieved remarkable advances in appearance-based identity association across homogeneous cameras, such as ground-ground matching. However, as a more practical scenario, aerial-ground person re-identification (AGPReID) among heterogeneous cameras has received minimal attention. To alleviate the disruption of discriminative identity representation by dramatic view discrepancy as the most significant challenge in AGPReID, the view-decoupled transformer (VDT) is proposed as a simple yet effective framework. Two major components are designed in VDT to decouple view-related and view-unrelated features, namely hierarchical subtractive separation and orthogonal loss, where the former separates these two features inside the VDT, and the latter constrains these two to be independent. In addition, we contribute a large-scale AGPReID dataset called CARGO, consisting of five/eight aerial/ground cameras, 5,000 identities, and 108,563 images. Experiments on two datasets show that VDT is a feasible and effective solution for AGPReID, surpassing the previous method on mAP/Rank1 by up to 5.0%/2.7% on CARGO and 3.7%/5.2% on AG-ReID, keeping the same magnitude of computational complexity.

      <title>Cobra: Extending Mamba to Multi-Modal Large Language Model for Efficient Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the application of multimodal large language models (MLLM) in various fields has achieved remarkable success. However, as the foundation model for many downstream tasks, current MLLMs are composed of the well-known Transformer network, which has a less efficient quadratic computation complexity. To improve the efficiency of such basic models, we propose Cobra, a linear computational complexity MLLM. Specifically, Cobra integrates the efficient Mamba language model into the visual modality. Moreover, we explore and study various modal fusion schemes to create an effective multi-modal Mamba. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (1) Cobra achieves extremely competitive performance with current computationally efficient state-of-the-art methods, \textit{e.g.}, LLaVA-Phi, TinyLLaVA, and MobileVLM v2, and has faster speed due to Cobra's linear sequential modeling. (2) Interestingly, the results of closed-set challenging prediction benchmarks show that Cobra performs well in overcoming visual illusions and spatial relationship judgments. (3) Notably, Cobra even achieves comparable performance to LLaVA with about 43% of the number of parameters. We will make all codes of Cobra open-source and hope that the proposed method can facilitate future research on complexity problems in MLLM.

      <title>HAC: Hash-grid Assisted Context for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising framework for novel view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To address this, we make use of the relations between the unorganized anchors and the structured hash grid, leveraging their mutual information for context modeling, and propose a Hash-grid Assisted Context (HAC) framework for highly compact 3DGS representation. Our approach introduces a binary hash grid to establish continuous spatial consistencies, allowing us to unveil the inherent spatial relations of anchors through a carefully designed context model. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to accurately estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Importantly, our work is the pioneer to explore context-based compression for 3DGS representation, resulting in a remarkable size reduction of over $75\times$ compared to vanilla 3DGS, while simultaneously improving fidelity, and achieving over $11\times$ size reduction over SOTA 3DGS compression approach Scaffold-GS.

      <title>Transfer Learning for Cross-dataset Isolated Sign Language Recognition in Under-Resourced Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) has recently achieved a breakthrough in performance thanks to deep neural networks trained on large annotated sign datasets. Of the many different sign languages, these annotated datasets are only available for a select few. Since acquiring gloss-level labels on sign language videos is difficult, learning by transferring knowledge from existing annotated sources is useful for recognition in under-resourced sign languages. This study provides a publicly available cross-dataset transfer learning benchmark from two existing public Turkish SLR datasets. We use a temporal graph convolution-based sign language recognition approach to evaluate five supervised transfer learning approaches and experiment with closed-set and partial-set cross-dataset transfer learning. Experiments demonstrate that improvement over finetuning based transfer learning is possible with specialized supervised transfer learning methods.</description>

      <title>Object-Centric Domain Randomization for 3D Shape Reconstruction in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the biggest challenges in single-view 3D shape reconstruction in the wild is the scarcity of &lt;3D shape, 2D image&gt;-paired data from real-world environments. Inspired by remarkable achievements via domain randomization, we propose ObjectDR which synthesizes such paired data via a random simulation of visual variations in object appearances and backgrounds. Our data synthesis framework exploits a conditional generative model (e.g., ControlNet) to generate images conforming to spatial conditions such as 2.5D sketches, which are obtainable through a rendering process of 3D shapes from object collections (e.g., Objaverse-XL). To simulate diverse variations while preserving object silhouettes embedded in spatial conditions, we also introduce a disentangled framework which leverages an initial object guidance. After synthesizing a wide range of data, we pre-train a model on them so that it learns to capture a domain-invariant geometry prior which is consistent across various domains. We validate its effectiveness by substantially improving 3D shape reconstruction models on a real-world benchmark. In a scale-up evaluation, our pre-training achieves 23.6% superior results compared with the pre-training on high-quality computer graphics renderings.</description>

      <title>Estimating Physical Information Consistency of Channel Data Augmentation for Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of data augmentation for deep learning (DL) methods plays an important role in achieving state-of-the-art results in supervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised image classification. In particular, channel transformations (e.g., solarize, grayscale, brightness adjustments) are integrated into data augmentation pipelines for remote sensing (RS) image classification tasks. However, contradicting beliefs exist about their proper applications to RS images. A common point of critique is that the application of channel augmentation techniques may lead to physically inconsistent spectral data (i.e., pixel signatures). To shed light on the open debate, we propose an approach to estimate whether a channel augmentation technique affects the physical information of RS images. To this end, the proposed approach estimates a score that measures the alignment of a pixel signature within a time series that can be naturally subject to deviations caused by factors such as acquisition conditions or phenological states of vegetation. We compare the scores associated with original and augmented pixel signatures to evaluate the physical consistency. Experimental results on a multi-label image classification task show that channel augmentations yielding a score that exceeds the expected deviation of original pixel signatures can not improve the performance of a baseline model trained without augmentation.</description>

      <title>DINO-Tracker: Taming DINO for Self-Supervised Point Tracking in a Single Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DINO-Tracker -- a new framework for long-term dense tracking in video. The pillar of our approach is combining test-time training on a single video, with the powerful localized semantic features learned by a pre-trained DINO-ViT model. Specifically, our framework simultaneously adopts DINO's features to fit to the motion observations of the test video, while training a tracker that directly leverages the refined features. The entire framework is trained end-to-end using a combination of self-supervised losses, and regularization that allows us to retain and benefit from DINO's semantic prior. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on known benchmarks. DINO-tracker significantly outperforms self-supervised methods and is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised trackers, while outperforming them in challenging cases of tracking under long-term occlusions.</description>

      <title>Token Transformation Matters: Towards Faithful Post-hoc Explanation for Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Transformers have rapidly gained popularity in various computer vision applications, post-hoc explanations of their internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Vision Transformers extract visual information by representing image regions as transformed tokens and integrating them via attention weights. However, existing post-hoc explanation methods merely consider these attention weights, neglecting crucial information from the transformed tokens, which fails to accurately illustrate the rationales behind the models' predictions. To incorporate the influence of token transformation into interpretation, we propose TokenTM, a novel post-hoc explanation method that utilizes our introduced measurement of token transformation effects. Specifically, we quantify token transformation effects by measuring changes in token lengths and correlations in their directions pre- and post-transformation. Moreover, we develop initialization and aggregation rules to integrate both attention weights and token transformation effects across all layers, capturing holistic token contributions throughout the model. Experimental results on segmentation and perturbation tests demonstrate the superiority of our proposed TokenTM compared to state-of-the-art Vision Transformer explanation methods.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Frosting: Editable Complex Radiance Fields with Real-Time Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Gaussian Frosting, a novel mesh-based representation for high-quality rendering and editing of complex 3D effects in real-time. Our approach builds on the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, which optimizes a set of 3D Gaussians to approximate a radiance field from images. We propose first extracting a base mesh from Gaussians during optimization, then building and refining an adaptive layer of Gaussians with a variable thickness around the mesh to better capture the fine details and volumetric effects near the surface, such as hair or grass. We call this layer Gaussian Frosting, as it resembles a coating of frosting on a cake. The fuzzier the material, the thicker the frosting. We also introduce a parameterization of the Gaussians to enforce them to stay inside the frosting layer and automatically adjust their parameters when deforming, rescaling, editing or animating the mesh. Our representation allows for efficient rendering using Gaussian splatting, as well as editing and animation by modifying the base mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various synthetic and real scenes, and show that it outperforms existing surface-based approaches. We will release our code and a web-based viewer as additional contributions. Our project page is the following: https://anttwo.github.io/frosting/</description>

      <title>Visibility-Aware Keypoint Localization for 6DoF Object Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localizing predefined 3D keypoints in a 2D image is an effective way to establish 3D-2D correspondences for 6DoF object pose estimation. However, unreliable localization results of invisible keypoints degrade the quality of correspondences. In this paper, we address this issue by localizing the important keypoints in terms of visibility. Since keypoint visibility information is currently missing in dataset collection process, we propose an efficient way to generate binary visibility labels from available object-level annotations, for keypoints of both asymmetric objects and symmetric objects. We further derive real-valued visibility-aware importance from binary labels based on PageRank algorithm. Taking advantage of the flexibility of our visibility-aware importance, we construct VAPO (Visibility-Aware POse estimator) by integrating the visibility-aware importance with a state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithm, along with additional positional encoding. Extensive experiments are conducted on popular pose estimation benchmarks including Linemod, Linemod-Occlusion, and YCB-V. The results show that, VAPO improves both the keypoint correspondences and final estimated poses, and clearly achieves state-of-the-art performances.</description>

      <title>Implicit Style-Content Separation using B-LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image stylization involves manipulating the visual appearance and texture (style) of an image while preserving its underlying objects, structures, and concepts (content). The separation of style and content is essential for manipulating the image's style independently from its content, ensuring a harmonious and visually pleasing result. Achieving this separation requires a deep understanding of both the visual and semantic characteristics of images, often necessitating the training of specialized models or employing heavy optimization. In this paper, we introduce B-LoRA, a method that leverages LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to implicitly separate the style and content components of a single image, facilitating various image stylization tasks. By analyzing the architecture of SDXL combined with LoRA, we find that jointly learning the LoRA weights of two specific blocks (referred to as B-LoRAs) achieves style-content separation that cannot be achieved by training each B-LoRA independently. Consolidating the training into only two blocks and separating style and content allows for significantly improving style manipulation and overcoming overfitting issues often associated with model fine-tuning. Once trained, the two B-LoRAs can be used as independent components to allow various image stylization tasks, including image style transfer, text-based image stylization, consistent style generation, and style-content mixing.</description>

      <title>VXP: Voxel-Cross-Pixel Large-scale Image-LiDAR Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works on the global place recognition treat the task as a retrieval problem, where an off-the-shelf global descriptor is commonly designed in image-based and LiDAR-based modalities. However, it is non-trivial to perform accurate image-LiDAR global place recognition since extracting consistent and robust global descriptors from different domains (2D images and 3D point clouds) is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel Voxel-Cross-Pixel (VXP) approach, which establishes voxel and pixel correspondences in a self-supervised manner and brings them into a shared feature space. Specifically, VXP is trained in a two-stage manner that first explicitly exploits local feature correspondences and enforces similarity of global descriptors. Extensive experiments on the three benchmarks (Oxford RobotCar, ViViD++ and KITTI) demonstrate our method surpasses the state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval by a large margin.</description>

      <title>PSALM: Pixelwise SegmentAtion with Large Multi-Modal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSALM is a powerful extension of the Large Multi-modal Model (LMM) to address the segmentation task challenges. To overcome the limitation of the LMM being limited to textual output, PSALM incorporates a mask decoder and a well-designed input schema to handle a variety of segmentation tasks. This schema includes images, task instructions, conditional prompts, and mask tokens, which enable the model to generate and classify segmentation masks effectively. The flexible design of PSALM supports joint training across multiple datasets and tasks, leading to improved performance and task generalization. PSALM achieves superior results on several benchmarks, such as RefCOCO/RefCOCO+/RefCOCOg, COCO Panoptic Segmentation, and COCO-Interactive, and further exhibits zero-shot capabilities on unseen tasks, such as open-vocabulary segmentation, generalized referring expression segmentation and video object segmentation, making a significant step towards a GPT moment in computer vision.

      <title>MyVLM: Personalizing VLMs for User-Specific Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating textual descriptions for visual content. However, these models lack an understanding of user-specific concepts. In this work, we take a first step toward the personalization of VLMs, enabling them to learn and reason over user-provided concepts. For example, we explore whether these models can learn to recognize you in an image and communicate what you are doing, tailoring the model to reflect your personal experiences and relationships. To effectively recognize a variety of user-specific concepts, we augment the VLM with external concept heads that function as toggles for the model, enabling the VLM to identify the presence of specific target concepts in a given image. Having recognized the concept, we learn a new concept embedding in the intermediate feature space of the VLM. This embedding is tasked with guiding the language model to naturally integrate the target concept in its generated response. We apply our technique to BLIP-2 and LLaVA for personalized image captioning and further show its applicability for personalized visual question-answering. Our experiments demonstrate our ability to generalize to unseen images of learned concepts while preserving the model behavior on unrelated inputs.</description>

      <title>ReNoise: Real Image Inversion Through Iterative Noising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have unlocked powerful image manipulation capabilities. However, applying these methods to real images necessitates the inversion of the images into the domain of the pretrained diffusion model. Achieving faithful inversion remains a challenge, particularly for more recent models trained to generate images with a small number of denoising steps. In this work, we introduce an inversion method with a high quality-to-operation ratio, enhancing reconstruction accuracy without increasing the number of operations. Building on reversing the diffusion sampling process, our method employs an iterative renoising mechanism at each inversion sampling step. This mechanism refines the approximation of a predicted point along the forward diffusion trajectory, by iteratively applying the pretrained diffusion model, and averaging these predictions. We evaluate the performance of our ReNoise technique using various sampling algorithms and models, including recent accelerated diffusion models. Through comprehensive evaluations and comparisons, we show its effectiveness in terms of both accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we confirm that our method preserves editability by demonstrating text-driven image editing on real images.</description>

      <title>T-Rex2: Towards Generic Object Detection via Text-Visual Prompt Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present T-Rex2, a highly practical model for open-set object detection. Previous open-set object detection methods relying on text prompts effectively encapsulate the abstract concept of common objects, but struggle with rare or complex object representation due to data scarcity and descriptive limitations. Conversely, visual prompts excel in depicting novel objects through concrete visual examples, but fall short in conveying the abstract concept of objects as effectively as text prompts. Recognizing the complementary strengths and weaknesses of both text and visual prompts, we introduce T-Rex2 that synergizes both prompts within a single model through contrastive learning. T-Rex2 accepts inputs in diverse formats, including text prompts, visual prompts, and the combination of both, so that it can handle different scenarios by switching between the two prompt modalities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that T-Rex2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot object detection capabilities across a wide spectrum of scenarios. We show that text prompts and visual prompts can benefit from each other within the synergy, which is essential to cover massive and complicated real-world scenarios and pave the way towards generic object detection. Model API is now available at \url{https://github.com/IDEA-Research/T-Rex}.</description>

      <title>Explorative Inbetweening of Time and Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce bounded generation as a generalized task to control video generation to synthesize arbitrary camera and subject motion based only on a given start and end frame. Our objective is to fully leverage the inherent generalization capability of an image-to-video model without additional training or fine-tuning of the original model. This is achieved through the proposed new sampling strategy, which we call Time Reversal Fusion, that fuses the temporally forward and backward denoising paths conditioned on the start and end frame, respectively. The fused path results in a video that smoothly connects the two frames, generating inbetweening of faithful subject motion, novel views of static scenes, and seamless video looping when the two bounding frames are identical. We curate a diverse evaluation dataset of image pairs and compare against the closest existing methods. We find that Time Reversal Fusion outperforms related work on all subtasks, exhibiting the ability to generate complex motions and 3D-consistent views guided by bounded frames.

      <title>DreamReward: Text-to-3D Generation with Human Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D content creation from text prompts has shown remarkable success recently. However, current text-to-3D methods often generate 3D results that do not align well with human preferences. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework, coined DreamReward, to learn and improve text-to-3D models from human preference feedback. To begin with, we collect 25k expert comparisons based on a systematic annotation pipeline including rating and ranking. Then, we build Reward3D -- the first general-purpose text-to-3D human preference reward model to effectively encode human preferences. Building upon the 3D reward model, we finally perform theoretical analysis and present the Reward3D Feedback Learning (DreamFL), a direct tuning algorithm to optimize the multi-view diffusion models with a redefined scorer. Grounded by theoretical proof and extensive experiment comparisons, our DreamReward successfully generates high-fidelity and 3D consistent results with significant boosts in prompt alignment with human intention. Our results demonstrate the great potential for learning from human feedback to improve text-to-3D models.</description>

      <title>AdaIR: Adaptive All-in-One Image Restoration via Frequency Mining and Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the image acquisition process, various forms of degradation, including noise, haze, and rain, are frequently introduced. These degradations typically arise from the inherent limitations of cameras or unfavorable ambient conditions. To recover clean images from degraded versions, numerous specialized restoration methods have been developed, each targeting a specific type of degradation. Recently, all-in-one algorithms have garnered significant attention by addressing different types of degradations within a single model without requiring prior information of the input degradation type. However, these methods purely operate in the spatial domain and do not delve into the distinct frequency variations inherent to different degradation types. To address this gap, we propose an adaptive all-in-one image restoration network based on frequency mining and modulation. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different degradation types impact the image content on different frequency subbands, thereby requiring different treatments for each restoration task. Specifically, we first mine low- and high-frequency information from the input features, guided by the adaptively decoupled spectra of the degraded image. The extracted features are then modulated by a bidirectional operator to facilitate interactions between different frequency components. Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original input for a progressively guided restoration. With this approach, the model achieves adaptive reconstruction by accentuating the informative frequency subbands according to different input degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different image restoration tasks, including denoising, dehazing, deraining, motion deblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

      <title>Hierarchical Text-to-Vision Self Supervised Alignment for Improved Histopathology Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has been highly promising for histopathology image analysis with numerous approaches leveraging their patient-slide-patch hierarchy to learn better representations. In this paper, we explore how the combination of domain specific natural language information with such hierarchical visual representations can benefit rich representation learning for medical image tasks. Building on automated language description generation for features visible in histopathology images, we present a novel language-tied self-supervised learning framework, Hierarchical Language-tied Self-Supervision (HLSS) for histopathology images. We explore contrastive objectives and granular language description based text alignment at multiple hierarchies to inject language modality information into the visual representations. Our resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two medical imaging benchmarks, OpenSRH and TCGA datasets. Our framework also provides better interpretability with our language aligned representation space. Code is available at https://github.com/Hasindri/HLSS.</description>

      <title>Videoshop: Localized Semantic Video Editing with Noise-Extrapolated Diffusion Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Videoshop, a training-free video editing algorithm for localized semantic edits. Videoshop allows users to use any editing software, including Photoshop and generative inpainting, to modify the first frame; it automatically propagates those changes, with semantic, spatial, and temporally consistent motion, to the remaining frames. Unlike existing methods that enable edits only through imprecise textual instructions, Videoshop allows users to add or remove objects, semantically change objects, insert stock photos into videos, etc. with fine-grained control over locations and appearance. We achieve this through image-based video editing by inverting latents with noise extrapolation, from which we generate videos conditioned on the edited image. Videoshop produces higher quality edits against 6 baselines on 2 editing benchmarks using 10 evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>ClusteringSDF: Self-Organized Neural Implicit Surfaces for 3D Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D decomposition/segmentation still remains a challenge as large-scale 3D annotated data is not readily available. Contemporary approaches typically leverage 2D machine-generated segments, integrating them for 3D consistency. While the majority of these methods are based on NeRFs, they face a potential weakness that the instance/semantic embedding features derive from independent MLPs, thus preventing the segmentation network from learning the geometric details of the objects directly through radiance and density. In this paper, we propose ClusteringSDF, a novel approach to achieve both segmentation and reconstruction in 3D via the neural implicit surface representation, specifically Signal Distance Function (SDF), where the segmentation rendering is directly integrated with the volume rendering of neural implicit surfaces. Although based on ObjectSDF++, ClusteringSDF no longer requires the ground-truth segments for supervision while maintaining the capability of reconstructing individual object surfaces, but purely with the noisy and inconsistent labels from pre-trained models.As the core of ClusteringSDF, we introduce a high-efficient clustering mechanism for lifting the 2D labels to 3D and the experimental results on the challenging scenes from ScanNet and Replica datasets show that ClusteringSDF can achieve competitive performance compared against the state-of-the-art with significantly reduced training time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GRM, a large-scale reconstructor capable of recovering a 3D asset from sparse-view images in around 0.1s. GRM is a feed-forward transformer-based model that efficiently incorporates multi-view information to translate the input pixels into pixel-aligned Gaussians, which are unprojected to create a set of densely distributed 3D Gaussians representing a scene. Together, our transformer architecture and the use of 3D Gaussians unlock a scalable and efficient reconstruction framework. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over alternatives regarding both reconstruction quality and efficiency. We also showcase the potential of GRM in generative tasks, i.e., text-to-3D and image-to-3D, by integrating it with existing multi-view diffusion models.

      <description>arXiv:2403.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language has become a prominent modality in computer vision with the rise of multi-modal LLMs. Despite supporting long context-lengths, their effectiveness in handling long-term information gradually declines with input length. This becomes critical, especially in applications such as long-form video understanding. In this paper, we introduce a Language Repository (LangRepo) for LLMs, that maintains concise and structured information as an interpretable (i.e., all-textual) representation. Our repository is updated iteratively based on multi-scale video chunks. We introduce write and read operations that focus on pruning redundancies in text, and extracting information at various temporal scales. The proposed framework is evaluated on zero-shot visual question-answering benchmarks including EgoSchema, NExT-QA, IntentQA and NExT-GQA, showing state-of-the-art performance at its scale.

      <title>MathVerse: Does Your Multi-modal LLM Truly See the Diagrams in Visual Math Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable progress of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has garnered unparalleled attention, due to their superior performance in visual contexts. However, their capabilities in visual math problem-solving remain insufficiently evaluated and understood. We investigate current benchmarks to incorporate excessive visual content within textual questions, which potentially assist MLLMs in deducing answers without truly interpreting the input diagrams. To this end, we introduce MathVerse, an all-around visual math benchmark designed for an equitable and in-depth evaluation of MLLMs. We meticulously collect 2,612 high-quality, multi-subject math problems with diagrams from publicly available sources. Each problem is then transformed by human annotators into six distinct versions, each offering varying degrees of information content in multi-modality, contributing to 15K test samples in total. This approach allows MathVerse to comprehensively assess whether and how much MLLMs can truly understand the visual diagrams for mathematical reasoning. In addition, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy for a fine-grained assessment of the output answers. Rather than naively judging True or False, we employ GPT-4(V) to adaptively extract crucial reasoning steps, and then score each step with detailed error analysis, which can reveal the intermediate CoT reasoning quality by MLLMs. We hope the MathVerse benchmark may provide unique insights to guide the future development of MLLMs. Project page: https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io</description>

      <title>LiFT: A Surprisingly Simple Lightweight Feature Transform for Dense ViT Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple self-supervised method to enhance the performance of ViT features for dense downstream tasks. Our Lightweight Feature Transform (LiFT) is a straightforward and compact postprocessing network that can be applied to enhance the features of any pre-trained ViT backbone. LiFT is fast and easy to train with a self-supervised objective, and it boosts the density of ViT features for minimal extra inference cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LiFT can be applied with approaches that use additional task-specific downstream modules, as we integrate LiFT with ViTDet for COCO detection and segmentation. Despite the simplicity of LiFT, we find that it is not simply learning a more complex version of bilinear interpolation. Instead, our LiFT training protocol leads to several desirable emergent properties that benefit ViT features in dense downstream tasks. This includes greater scale invariance for features, and better object boundary maps. By simply training LiFT for a few epochs, we show improved performance on keypoint correspondence, detection, segmentation, and object discovery tasks. Overall, LiFT provides an easy way to unlock the benefits of denser feature arrays for a fraction of the computational cost.

      <title>MVSplat: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Multi-View Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose MVSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting model learned from sparse multi-view images. To accurately localize the Gaussian centers, we propose to build a cost volume representation via plane sweeping in the 3D space, where the cross-view feature similarities stored in the cost volume can provide valuable geometry cues to the estimation of depth. We learn the Gaussian primitives' opacities, covariances, and spherical harmonics coefficients jointly with the Gaussian centers while only relying on photometric supervision. We demonstrate the importance of the cost volume representation in learning feed-forward Gaussian Splatting models via extensive experimental evaluations. On the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID benchmarks, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with the fastest feed-forward inference speed (22 fps). Compared to the latest state-of-the-art method pixelSplat, our model uses $10\times $ fewer parameters and infers more than $2\times$ faster while providing higher appearance and geometry quality as well as better cross-dataset generalization.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Multi-Object Shape Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 3D shape completion method that recovers the complete geometry of multiple objects in complex scenes from a single RGB-D image. Despite notable advancements in single object 3D shape completion, high-quality reconstructions in highly cluttered real-world multi-object scenes remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose OctMAE, an architecture that leverages an Octree U-Net and a latent 3D MAE to achieve high-quality and near real-time multi-object shape completion through both local and global geometric reasoning. Because a na\"ive 3D MAE can be computationally intractable and memory intensive even in the latent space, we introduce a novel occlusion masking strategy and adopt 3D rotary embeddings, which significantly improves the runtime and shape completion quality. To generalize to a wide range of objects in diverse scenes, we create a large-scale photorealistic dataset, featuring a diverse set of 12K 3D object models from the Objaverse dataset which are rendered in multi-object scenes with physics-based positioning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrates a strong zero-shot capability.</description>

Abstract: Particle accelerators are complex systems that focus, guide, and accelerate intense charged particle beams to high energy. Beam diagnostics present a challenging problem due to limited non-destructive measurements, computationally demanding simulations, and inherent uncertainties in the system. We propose a two-step unsupervised deep learning framework named as Conditional Latent Autoregressive Recurrent Model (CLARM) for learning the spatiotemporal dynamics of charged particles in accelerators. CLARM consists of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) transforming six-dimensional phase space into a lower-dimensional latent distribution and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network capturing temporal dynamics in an autoregressive manner. The CLARM can generate projections at various accelerator modules by sampling and decoding the latent space representation. The model also forecasts future states (downstream locations) of charged particles from past states (upstream locations). The results demonstrate that the generative and forecasting ability of the proposed approach is promising when tested against a variety of evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Towards Learning Contrast Kinetics with Multi-Condition Latent Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrast agents in dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allow to localize tumors and observe their contrast kinetics, which is essential for cancer characterization and respective treatment decision-making. However, contrast agent administration is not only associated with adverse health risks, but also restricted for patients during pregnancy, and for those with kidney malfunction, or other adverse reactions. With contrast uptake as key biomarker for lesion malignancy, cancer recurrence risk, and treatment response, it becomes pivotal to reduce the dependency on intravenous contrast agent administration. To this end, we propose a multi-conditional latent diffusion model capable of acquisition time-conditioned image synthesis of DCE-MRI temporal sequences. To evaluate medical image synthesis, we additionally propose and validate the Fr\'echet radiomics distance as an image quality measure based on biomarker variability between synthetic and real imaging data. Our results demonstrate our method's ability to generate realistic multi-sequence fat-saturated breast DCE-MRI and uncover the emerging potential of deep learning based contrast kinetics simulation. We publicly share our accessible codebase at https://github.com/RichardObi/ccnet.</description>

      <title>P-Count: Persistence-based Counting of White Matter Hyperintensities in Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a hallmark of cerebrovascular disease and multiple sclerosis. Automated WMH segmentation methods enable quantitative analysis via estimation of total lesion load, spatial distribution of lesions, and number of lesions (i.e., number of connected components after thresholding), all of which are correlated with patient outcomes. While the two former measures can generally be estimated robustly, the number of lesions is highly sensitive to noise and segmentation mistakes -- even when small connected components are eroded or disregarded. In this article, we present P-Count, an algebraic WMH counting tool based on persistent homology that accounts for the topological features of WM lesions in a robust manner. Using computational geometry, P-Count takes the persistence of connected components into consideration, effectively filtering out the noisy WMH positives, resulting in a more accurate count of true lesions. We validated P-Count on the ISBI2015 longitudinal lesion segmentation dataset, where it produces significantly more accurate results than direct thresholding.</description>

      <title>Accelerating ViT Inference on FPGA through Static and Dynamic Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on various computer vision tasks. However, their high computational complexity prevents them from being applied to many real-world applications. Weight and token pruning are two well-known methods for reducing complexity: weight pruning reduces the model size and associated computational demands, while token pruning further dynamically reduces the computation based on the input. Combining these two techniques should significantly reduce computation complexity and model size; however, naively integrating them results in irregular computation patterns, leading to significant accuracy drops and difficulties in hardware acceleration.
  Addressing the above challenges, we propose a comprehensive algorithm-hardware codesign for accelerating ViT on FPGA through simultaneous pruning -combining static weight pruning and dynamic token pruning. For algorithm design, we systematically combine a hardware-aware structured block-pruning method for pruning model parameters and a dynamic token pruning method for removing unimportant token vectors. Moreover, we design a novel training algorithm to recover the model's accuracy. For hardware design, we develop a novel hardware accelerator for executing the pruned model. The proposed hardware design employs multi-level parallelism with load balancing strategy to efficiently deal with the irregular computation pattern led by the two pruning approaches. Moreover, we develop an efficient hardware mechanism for efficiently executing the on-the-fly token pruning.</description>

      <title>LeFusion: Synthesizing Myocardial Pathology on Cardiac MRI via Lesion-Focus Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data generated in clinical practice often exhibits biases, such as long-tail imbalance and algorithmic unfairness. This study aims to mitigate these challenges through data synthesis. Previous efforts in medical imaging synthesis have struggled with separating lesion information from background context, leading to difficulties in generating high-quality backgrounds and limited control over the synthetic output. Inspired by diffusion-based image inpainting, we propose LeFusion, lesion-focused diffusion models. By redesigning the diffusion learning objectives to concentrate on lesion areas, it simplifies the model learning process and enhance the controllability of the synthetic output, while preserving background by integrating forward-diffused background contexts into the reverse diffusion process. Furthermore, we generalize it to jointly handle multi-class lesions, and further introduce a generative model for lesion masks to increase synthesis diversity. Validated on the DE-MRI cardiac lesion segmentation dataset (Emidec), our methodology employs the popular nnUNet to demonstrate that the synthetic data make it possible to effectively enhance a state-of-the-art model. Code and model are available at https://github.com/M3DV/LeFusion.</description>

      <title>QSMDiff: Unsupervised 3D Diffusion Models for Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) dipole inversion is an ill-posed inverse problem for quantifying magnetic susceptibility distributions from MRI tissue phases. While supervised deep learning methods have shown success in specific QSM tasks, their generalizability across different acquisition scenarios remains constrained. Recent developments in diffusion models have demonstrated potential for solving 2D medical imaging inverse problems. However, their application to 3D modalities, such as QSM, remains challenging due to high computational demands. In this work, we developed a 3D image patch-based diffusion model, namely QSMDiff, for robust QSM reconstruction across different scan parameters, alongside simultaneous super-resolution and image-denoising tasks. QSMDiff adopts unsupervised 3D image patch training and full-size measurement guidance during inference for controlled image generation. Evaluation on simulated and in-vivo human brains, using gradient-echo and echo-planar imaging sequences across different acquisition parameters, demonstrates superior performance. The method proposed in QSMDiff also holds promise for impacting other 3D medical imaging applications beyond QSM.</description>

      <title>Powerful Lossy Compression for Noisy Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image compression and denoising represent fundamental challenges in image processing with many real-world applications. To address practical demands, current solutions can be categorized into two main strategies: 1) sequential method; and 2) joint method. However, sequential methods have the disadvantage of error accumulation as there is information loss between multiple individual models. Recently, the academic community began to make some attempts to tackle this problem through end-to-end joint methods. Most of them ignore that different regions of noisy images have different characteristics. To solve these problems, in this paper, our proposed signal-to-noise ratio~(SNR) aware joint solution exploits local and non-local features for image compression and denoising simultaneously. We design an end-to-end trainable network, which includes the main encoder branch, the guidance branch, and the signal-to-noise ratio~(SNR) aware branch. We conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that our joint solution outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Evidential Semantic Mapping in Off-road Environments with Uncertainty-aware Bayesian Kernel Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic mapping with Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI) has shown promise in creating semantic maps by effectively leveraging local spatial information. However, existing semantic mapping methods face challenges in constructing reliable maps in unstructured outdoor scenarios due to unreliable semantic predictions. To address this issue, we propose an evidential semantic mapping, which can enhance reliability in perceptually challenging off-road environments. We integrate Evidential Deep Learning into the semantic segmentation network to obtain the uncertainty estimate of semantic prediction. Subsequently, this semantic uncertainty is incorporated into an uncertainty-aware BKI, tailored to prioritize more confident semantic predictions when accumulating semantic information. By adaptively handling semantic uncertainties, the proposed framework constructs robust representations of the surroundings even in previously unseen environments. Comprehensive experiments across various off-road datasets demonstrate that our framework enhances accuracy and robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods in scenes with high perceptual uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Model-based Room-Object Relationships Knowledge for Enhancing Multimodal-Input Object Goal Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object-goal navigation is a crucial engineering task for the community of embodied navigation; it involves navigating to an instance of a specified object category within unseen environments. Although extensive investigations have been conducted on both end-to-end and modular-based, data-driven approaches, fully enabling an agent to comprehend the environment through perceptual knowledge and perform object-goal navigation as efficiently as humans remains a significant challenge. Recently, large language models have shown potential in this task, thanks to their powerful capabilities for knowledge extraction and integration. In this study, we propose a data-driven, modular-based approach, trained on a dataset that incorporates common-sense knowledge of object-to-room relationships extracted from a large language model. We utilize the multi-channel Swin-Unet architecture to conduct multi-task learning incorporating with multimodal inputs. The results in the Habitat simulator demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baseline by an average of 10.6% in the efficiency metric, Success weighted by Path Length (SPL). The real-world demonstration shows that the proposed approach can efficiently conduct this task by traversing several rooms.

      <description>arXiv:2403.14200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays an ever-growing concerning phenomenon, the emergence of algorithmic biases that can lead to unfair models, emerges. Several debiasing approaches have been proposed in the realm of deep learning, employing more or less sophisticated approaches to discourage these models from massively employing these biases. However, a question emerges: is this extra complexity really necessary? Is a vanilla-trained model already embodying some ``unbiased sub-networks'' that can be used in isolation and propose a solution without relying on the algorithmic biases? In this work, we show that such a sub-network typically exists, and can be extracted from a vanilla-trained model without requiring additional training. We further validate that such specific architecture is incapable of learning a specific bias, suggesting that there are possible architectural countermeasures to the problem of biases in deep neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present source detection and catalogue construction pipelines to build the first catalogue of radio galaxies from the 270 $\rm deg^2$ pilot survey of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU-PS) conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. The detection pipeline uses Gal-DINO computer-vision networks (Gupta et al., 2024) to predict the categories of radio morphology and bounding boxes for radio sources, as well as their potential infrared host positions. The Gal-DINO network is trained and evaluated on approximately 5,000 visually inspected radio galaxies and their infrared hosts, encompassing both compact and extended radio morphologies. We find that the Intersection over Union (IoU) for the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes is larger than 0.5 for 99% of the radio sources, and 98% of predicted host positions are within $3^{\prime \prime}$ of the ground truth infrared host in the evaluation set. The catalogue construction pipeline uses the predictions of the trained network on the radio and infrared image cutouts based on the catalogue of radio components identified using the Selavy source finder algorithm. Confidence scores of the predictions are then used to prioritize Selavy components with higher scores and incorporate them first into the catalogue. This results in identifications for a total of 211,625 radio sources, with 201,211 classified as compact and unresolved. The remaining 10,414 are categorized as extended radio morphologies, including 582 FR-I, 5,602 FR-II, 1,494 FR-x (uncertain whether FR-I or FR-II), 2,375 R (single-peak resolved) radio galaxies, and 361 with peculiar and other rare morphologies. We cross-match the radio sources in the catalogue with the infrared and optical catalogues, finding infrared cross-matches for 73% and photometric redshifts for 36% of the radio galaxies.</description>

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence creates great promise in the field of medical discovery, diagnostics and patient management. However, the vast complexity of all medical domains require a more complex approach that combines machine learning algorithms, classifiers, segmentation algorithms and, lately, large language models. In this paper, we describe, implement and assess an Artificial Intelligence-empowered system and methodology aimed at assisting the diagnosis process of skin lesions and other skin conditions within the field of dermatology that aims to holistically address the diagnostic process in this domain. The workflow integrates large language, transformer-based vision models and sophisticated machine learning tools. This holistic approach achieves a nuanced interpretation of dermatological conditions that simulates and facilitates a dermatologist's workflow. We assess our proposed methodology through a thorough cross-model validation technique embedded in an evaluation pipeline that utilizes publicly available medical case studies of skin conditions and relevant images. To quantitatively score the system performance, advanced machine learning and natural language processing tools are employed which focus on similarity comparison and natural language inference. Additionally, we incorporate a human expert evaluation process based on a structured checklist to further validate our results. We implemented the proposed methodology in a system which achieved approximate (weighted) scores of 0.87 for both contextual understanding and diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in enhancing dermatological analysis. The proposed methodology is expected to prove useful in the development of next-generation tele-dermatology applications, enhancing remote consultation capabilities and access to care, especially in underserved areas.</description>

Abstract: Skin cancer is a crucial health issue that requires timely detection for higher survival rates. Traditional computer vision techniques face challenges in addressing the advanced variability of skin lesion features, a gap partially bridged by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To overcome the existing issues, we introduce an innovative convolutional ensemble network approach named deep autoencoder (DAE) with ResNet101. This method utilizes convolution-based deep neural networks for the detection of skin cancer. The ISIC-2018 public data taken from the source is used for experimental results, which demonstrate remarkable performance with the different in terms of performance metrics. The methods result in 96.03% of accuracy, 95.40 % of precision, 96.05% of recall, 0.9576 of F-measure, 0.98 of AUC.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Medical Image Segmentation Datasets against Unauthorized Training via Contour- and Texture-Aware Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread availability of publicly accessible medical images has significantly propelled advancements in various research and clinical fields. Nonetheless, concerns regarding unauthorized training of AI systems for commercial purposes and the duties of patient privacy protection have led numerous institutions to hesitate to share their images. This is particularly true for medical image segmentation (MIS) datasets, where the processes of collection and fine-grained annotation are time-intensive and laborious. Recently, Unlearnable Examples (UEs) methods have shown the potential to protect images by adding invisible shortcuts. These shortcuts can prevent unauthorized deep neural networks from generalizing. However, existing UEs are designed for natural image classification and fail to protect MIS datasets imperceptibly as their protective perturbations are less learnable than important prior knowledge in MIS, e.g., contour and texture features. To this end, we propose an Unlearnable Medical image generation method, termed UMed. UMed integrates the prior knowledge of MIS by injecting contour- and texture-aware perturbations to protect images. Given that our target is to only poison features critical to MIS, UMed requires only minimal perturbations within the ROI and its contour to achieve greater imperceptibility (average PSNR is 50.03) and protective performance (clean average DSC degrades from 82.18% to 6.80%).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes LayoutLLM, a more flexible document analysis method for understanding imaged documents. Visually Rich Document Understanding tasks, such as document image classification and information extraction, have gained significant attention due to their importance. Existing methods have been developed to enhance document comprehension by incorporating pre-training awareness of images, text, and layout structure. However, these methods require fine-tuning for each task and dataset, and the models are expensive to train and operate. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new LayoutLLM that integrates these with large-scale language models (LLMs). By leveraging the strengths of existing research in document image understanding and LLMs' superior language understanding capabilities, the proposed model, fine-tuned with multimodal instruction datasets, performs an understanding of document images in a single model. Our experiments demonstrate improvement over the baseline model in various document analysis tasks.</description>

Consequently, unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) emerges as a viable alternative for pathology segmentation, as only healthy data is required for training. However, recent UAD anomaly scoring functions often focus on intensity only and neglect structural differences, which impedes the segmentation performance. This work investigates the potential of Structural Similarity (SSIM) to bridge this gap. SSIM captures both intensity and structural disparities and can be advantageous over the classical $l1$ error. However, we show that there is more than one optimal kernel size for the SSIM calculation for different pathologies. Therefore, we investigate an adaptive ensembling strategy for various kernel sizes to offer a more pathology-agnostic scoring mechanism. We demonstrate that this ensembling strategy can enhance the performance of DMs and mitigate the sensitivity to different kernel sizes across varying pathologies, highlighting its promise for brain MRI anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Robustness of Spectral Clustering for Deep Speaker Diarization</title>

Abstract: Clustering speaker embeddings is crucial in speaker diarization but hasn't received as much focus as other components. Moreover, the robustness of speaker diarization across various datasets hasn't been explored when the development and evaluation data are from different domains. To bridge this gap, this study thoroughly examines spectral clustering for both same-domain and cross-domain speaker diarization. Our extensive experiments on two widely used corpora, AMI and DIHARD, reveal the performance trend of speaker diarization in the presence of domain mismatch. We observe that the performance difference between two different domain conditions can be attributed to the role of spectral clustering. In particular, keeping other modules unchanged, we show that differences in optimal tuning parameters as well as speaker count estimation originates due to the mismatch. This study opens several future directions for speaker diarization research.</description>

      <title>Exploring Green AI for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors leveraging deep neural networks exhibit impressive recognition performance. Nonetheless, this advantage is accompanied by a significant carbon footprint. This is mainly due to the use of high-performance computing with accelerators and high training time. Studies show that average deep NLP model produces around 626k lbs of CO\textsubscript{2} which is equivalent to five times of average US car emission at its lifetime. This is certainly a massive threat to the environment. To tackle this challenge, this study presents a novel framework for audio deepfake detection that can be seamlessly trained using standard CPU resources. Our proposed framework utilizes off-the-shelve self-supervised learning (SSL) based models which are pre-trained and available in public repositories. In contrast to existing methods that fine-tune SSL models and employ additional deep neural networks for downstream tasks, we exploit classical machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and shallow neural networks using the SSL embeddings extracted using the pre-trained model. Our approach shows competitive results compared to the commonly used high-carbon footprint approaches. In experiments with the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset, we achieve a 0.90\% equal error rate (EER) with less than 1k trainable model parameters. To encourage further research in this direction and support reproducible results, the Python code will be made publicly accessible following acceptance.

      <title>Impact Assessment of Missing Data in Model Predictions for Earth Observation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth observation (EO) applications involving complex and heterogeneous data sources are commonly approached with machine learning models. However, there is a common assumption that data sources will be persistently available. Different situations could affect the availability of EO sources, like noise, clouds, or satellite mission failures. In this work, we assess the impact of missing temporal and static EO sources in trained models across four datasets with classification and regression tasks. We compare the predictive quality of different methods and find that some are naturally more robust to missing data. The Ensemble strategy, in particular, achieves a prediction robustness up to 100%. We evidence that missing scenarios are significantly more challenging in regression than classification tasks. Finally, we find that the optical view is the most critical view when it is missing individually.</description>

      <title>SpikingResformer: Bridging ResNet and Vision Transformer in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of Vision Transformers in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has led to a growing interest in incorporating the self-attention mechanism and transformer-based architecture into Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). While existing methods propose spiking self-attention mechanisms that are compatible with SNNs, they lack reasonable scaling methods, and the overall architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively extracting local features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spiking self-attention mechanism named Dual Spike Self-Attention (DSSA) with a reasonable scaling method. Based on DSSA, we propose a novel spiking Vision Transformer architecture called SpikingResformer, which combines the ResNet-based multi-stage architecture with our proposed DSSA to improve both performance and energy efficiency while reducing parameters. Experimental results show that SpikingResformer achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower energy consumption than other spiking Vision Transformer counterparts. Notably, our SpikingResformer-L achieves 79.40% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 4 time-steps, which is the state-of-the-art result in the SNN field.</description>

      <title>Exosense: A Vision-Centric Scene Understanding System For Safe Exoskeleton Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoskeletons for daily use by those with mobility impairments are being developed. They will require accurate and robust scene understanding systems. Current research has used vision to identify immediate terrain and geometric obstacles, however these approaches are constrained to detections directly in front of the user and are limited to classifying a finite range of terrain types (e.g., stairs, ramps and level-ground). This paper presents Exosense, a vision-centric scene understanding system which is capable of generating rich, globally-consistent elevation maps, incorporating both semantic and terrain traversability information. It features an elastic Atlas mapping framework associated with a visual SLAM pose graph, embedded with open-vocabulary room labels from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). The device's design includes a wide field-of-view (FoV) fisheye multi-camera system to mitigate the challenges introduced by the exoskeleton walking pattern. We demonstrate the system's robustness to the challenges of typical periodic walking gaits, and its ability to construct accurate semantically-rich maps in indoor settings. Additionally, we showcase its potential for motion planning -- providing a step towards safe navigation for exoskeletons.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Processing and Reconstruction of Compromised Biophotonic Image Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of deep learning techniques with biophotonic setups has opened new horizons in bioimaging. A compelling trend in this field involves deliberately compromising certain measurement metrics to engineer better bioimaging tools in terms of cost, speed, and form-factor, followed by compensating for the resulting defects through the utilization of deep learning models trained on a large amount of ideal, superior or alternative data. This strategic approach has found increasing popularity due to its potential to enhance various aspects of biophotonic imaging. One of the primary motivations for employing this strategy is the pursuit of higher temporal resolution or increased imaging speed, critical for capturing fine dynamic biological processes. This approach also offers the prospect of simplifying hardware requirements/complexities, thereby making advanced imaging standards more accessible in terms of cost and/or size. This article provides an in-depth review of the diverse measurement aspects that researchers intentionally impair in their biophotonic setups, including the point spread function, signal-to-noise ratio, sampling density, and pixel resolution. By deliberately compromising these metrics, researchers aim to not only recuperate them through the application of deep learning networks, but also bolster in return other crucial parameters, such as the field-of-view, depth-of-field, and space-bandwidth product. Here, we discuss various biophotonic methods that have successfully employed this strategic approach. These techniques span broad applications and showcase the versatility and effectiveness of deep learning in the context of compromised biophotonic data. Finally, by offering our perspectives on the future possibilities of this rapidly evolving concept, we hope to motivate our readers to explore novel ways of balancing hardware compromises with compensation via AI.</description>

      <title>$\nabla \tau$: Gradient-based and Task-Agnostic machine Unlearning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning, the process of selectively eliminating the influence of certain data examples used during a model's training, has gained significant attention as a means for practitioners to comply with recent data protection regulations. However, existing unlearning methods face critical drawbacks, including their prohibitively high cost, often associated with a large number of hyperparameters, and the limitation of forgetting only relatively small data portions. This often makes retraining the model from scratch a quicker and more effective solution. In this study, we introduce Gradient-based and Task-Agnostic machine Unlearning ($\nabla \tau$), an optimization framework designed to remove the influence of a subset of training data efficiently. It applies adaptive gradient ascent to the data to be forgotten while using standard gradient descent for the remaining data. $\nabla \tau$ offers multiple benefits over existing approaches. It enables the unlearning of large sections of the training dataset (up to 30%). It is versatile, supporting various unlearning tasks (such as subset forgetting or class removal) and applicable across different domains (images, text, etc.). Importantly, $\nabla \tau$ requires no hyperparameter adjustments, making it a more appealing option than retraining the model from scratch. We evaluate our framework's effectiveness using a set of well-established Membership Inference Attack metrics, demonstrating up to 10% enhancements in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising the original model's accuracy.</description>

      <title>DP-RDM: Adapting Diffusion Models to Private Domains Without Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have been shown to suffer from sample-level memorization, possibly reproducing near-perfect replica of images that they are trained on, which may be undesirable. To remedy this issue, we develop the first differentially private (DP) retrieval-augmented generation algorithm that is capable of generating high-quality image samples while providing provable privacy guarantees. Specifically, we assume access to a text-to-image diffusion model trained on a small amount of public data, and design a DP retrieval mechanism to augment the text prompt with samples retrieved from a private retrieval dataset. Our \emph{differentially private retrieval-augmented diffusion model} (DP-RDM) requires no fine-tuning on the retrieval dataset to adapt to another domain, and can use state-of-the-art generative models to generate high-quality image samples while satisfying rigorous DP guarantees. For instance, when evaluated on MS-COCO, our DP-RDM can generate samples with a privacy budget of $\epsilon=10$, while providing a $3.5$ point improvement in FID compared to public-only retrieval for up to $10,000$ queries.</description>

      <title>Analysing Diffusion Segmentation for Medical Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models have become increasingly popular due to their ability to offer probabilistic modeling and generate diverse outputs. This versatility inspired their adaptation for image segmentation, where multiple predictions of the model can produce segmentation results that not only achieve high quality but also capture the uncertainty inherent in the model. Here, powerful architectures were proposed for improving diffusion segmentation performance. However, there is a notable lack of analysis and discussions on the differences between diffusion segmentation and image generation, and thorough evaluations are missing that distinguish the improvements these architectures provide for segmentation in general from their benefit for diffusion segmentation specifically. In this work, we critically analyse and discuss how diffusion segmentation for medical images differs from diffusion image generation, with a particular focus on the training behavior. Furthermore, we conduct an assessment how proposed diffusion segmentation architectures perform when trained directly for segmentation. Lastly, we explore how different medical segmentation tasks influence the diffusion segmentation behavior and the diffusion process could be adapted accordingly. With these analyses, we aim to provide in-depth insights into the behavior of diffusion segmentation that allow for a better design and evaluation of diffusion segmentation methods in the future.</description>

      <title>CathFlow: Self-Supervised Segmentation of Catheters in Interventional Ultrasound Using Optical Flow and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In minimally invasive endovascular procedures, contrast-enhanced angiography remains the most robust imaging technique. However, it is at the expense of the patient and clinician's health due to prolonged radiation exposure. As an alternative, interventional ultrasound has notable benefits such as being radiation-free, fast to deploy, and having a small footprint in the operating room. Yet, ultrasound is hard to interpret, and highly prone to artifacts and noise. Additionally, interventional radiologists must undergo extensive training before they become qualified to diagnose and treat patients effectively, leading to a shortage of staff, and a lack of open-source datasets. In this work, we seek to address both problems by introducing a self-supervised deep learning architecture to segment catheters in longitudinal ultrasound images, without demanding any labeled data. The network architecture builds upon AiAReSeg, a segmentation transformer built with the Attention in Attention mechanism, and is capable of learning feature changes across time and space. To facilitate training, we used synthetic ultrasound data based on physics-driven catheter insertion simulations, and translated the data into a unique CT-Ultrasound common domain, CACTUSS, to improve the segmentation performance. We generated ground truth segmentation masks by computing the optical flow between adjacent frames using FlowNet2, and performed thresholding to obtain a binary map estimate. Finally, we validated our model on a test dataset, consisting of unseen synthetic data and images collected from silicon aorta phantoms, thus demonstrating its potential for applications to clinical data in the future.</description>

      <title>Detoxifying Large Language Models via Knowledge Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates using knowledge editing techniques to detoxify Large Language Models (LLMs). We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments to compare knowledge editing approaches with previous baselines, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to efficiently detoxify LLMs with limited impact on general performance. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxify approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</description>

      <title>HyperGALE: ASD Classification via Hypergraph Gated Attention with Learnable Hyperedges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by varied social cognitive challenges and repetitive behavioral patterns. Identifying reliable brain imaging-based biomarkers for ASD has been a persistent challenge due to the spectrum's diverse symptomatology. Existing baselines in the field have made significant strides in this direction, yet there remains room for improvement in both performance and interpretability. We propose \emph{HyperGALE}, which builds upon the hypergraph by incorporating learned hyperedges and gated attention mechanisms. This approach has led to substantial improvements in the model's ability to interpret complex brain graph data, offering deeper insights into ASD biomarker characterization. Evaluated on the extensive ABIDE II dataset, \emph{HyperGALE} not only improves interpretability but also demonstrates statistically significant enhancements in key performance metrics compared to both previous baselines and the foundational hypergraph model. The advancement \emph{HyperGALE} brings to ASD research highlights the potential of sophisticated graph-based techniques in neurodevelopmental studies.

      <title>Denoising Diffusion Models for 3D Healthy Brain Tissue Inpainting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring diseases that affect the brain's structural integrity requires automated analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) images, e.g., for the evaluation of volumetric changes. However, many of the evaluation tools are optimized for analyzing healthy tissue. To enable the evaluation of scans containing pathological tissue, it is therefore required to restore healthy tissue in the pathological areas. In this work, we explore and extend denoising diffusion models for consistent inpainting of healthy 3D brain tissue. We modify state-of-the-art 2D, pseudo-3D, and 3D methods working in the image space, as well as 3D latent and 3D wavelet diffusion models, and train them to synthesize healthy brain tissue. Our evaluation shows that the pseudo-3D model performs best regarding the structural-similarity index, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and mean squared error. To emphasize the clinical relevance, we fine-tune this model on data containing synthetic MS lesions and evaluate it on a downstream brain tissue segmentation task, whereby it outperforms the established FMRIB Software Library (FSL) lesion-filling method.</description>

      <title>Invisible Needle Detection in Ultrasound: Leveraging Mechanism-Induced Vibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clinical applications that involve ultrasound-guided intervention, the visibility of the needle can be severely impeded due to steep insertion and strong distractors such as speckle noise and anatomical occlusion. To address this challenge, we propose VibNet, a learning-based framework tailored to enhance the robustness and accuracy of needle detection in ultrasound images, even when the target becomes invisible to the naked eye. Inspired by Eulerian Video Magnification techniques, we utilize an external step motor to induce low-amplitude periodic motion on the needle. These subtle vibrations offer the potential to generate robust frequency features for detecting the motion patterns around the needle. To robustly and precisely detect the needle leveraging these vibrations, VibNet integrates learning-based Short-Time-Fourier-Transform and Hough-Transform modules to achieve successive sub-goals, including motion feature extraction in the spatiotemporal space, frequency feature aggregation, and needle detection in the Hough space. Based on the results obtained on distinct ex vivo porcine and bovine tissue samples, the proposed algorithm exhibits superior detection performance with efficient computation and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Click to Grasp: Zero-Shot Precise Manipulation via Visual Diffusion Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise manipulation that is generalizable across scenes and objects remains a persistent challenge in robotics. Current approaches for this task heavily depend on having a significant number of training instances to handle objects with pronounced visual and/or geometric part ambiguities. Our work explores the grounding of fine-grained part descriptors for precise manipulation in a zero-shot setting by utilizing web-trained text-to-image diffusion-based generative models. We tackle the problem by framing it as a dense semantic part correspondence task. Our model returns a gripper pose for manipulating a specific part, using as reference a user-defined click from a source image of a visually different instance of the same object. We require no manual grasping demonstrations as we leverage the intrinsic object geometry and features. Practical experiments in a real-world tabletop scenario validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating its potential for advancing semantic-aware robotics manipulation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel theoretical simplification of the Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) that facilitates its unification with Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), addressing the limitations of DSB in complex data generation and enabling faster convergence and enhanced performance. By employing SGMs as an initial solution for DSB, our approach capitalizes on the strengths of both frameworks, ensuring a more efficient training process and improving the performance of SGM. We also propose a reparameterization technique that, despite theoretical approximations, practically improves the network's fitting capabilities. Our extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the simplified DSB, demonstrating its significant improvements. We believe the contributions of this work pave the way for advanced generative modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/tzco/Simplified-Diffusion-Schrodinger-Bridge.</description>

      <title>ODTFormer: Efficient Obstacle Detection and Tracking with Stereo Cameras Based on Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obstacle detection and tracking represent a critical component in robot autonomous navigation. In this paper, we propose ODTFormer, a Transformer-based model to address both obstacle detection and tracking problems. For the detection task, our approach leverages deformable attention to construct a 3D cost volume, which is decoded progressively in the form of voxel occupancy grids. We further track the obstacles by matching the voxels between consecutive frames. The entire model can be optimized in an end-to-end manner. Through extensive experiments on DrivingStereo and KITTI benchmarks, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the obstacle detection task. We also report comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art obstacle tracking models while requiring only a fraction of their computation cost, typically ten-fold to twenty-fold less. The code and model weights will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>AI-KD: Adversarial learning and Implicit regularization for self-Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel adversarial penalized self-knowledge distillation method, named adversarial learning and implicit regularization for self-knowledge distillation (AI-KD), which regularizes the training procedure by adversarial learning and implicit distillations. Our model not only distills the deterministic and progressive knowledge which are from the pre-trained and previous epoch predictive probabilities but also transfers the knowledge of the deterministic predictive distributions using adversarial learning. The motivation is that the self-knowledge distillation methods regularize the predictive probabilities with soft targets, but the exact distributions may be hard to predict. Our method deploys a discriminator to distinguish the distributions between the pre-trained and student models while the student model is trained to fool the discriminator in the trained procedure. Thus, the student model not only can learn the pre-trained model's predictive probabilities but also align the distributions between the pre-trained and student models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with network architectures on multiple datasets and show the proposed method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>ComCLIP: Training-Free Compositional Image and Text Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13854v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated great zero-shot performance for matching images and text. However, it is still challenging to adapt vision-lanaguage pretrained models like CLIP to compositional image and text matching -- a more challenging image and text matching task requiring the model understanding of compositional word concepts and visual components. Towards better compositional generalization in zero-shot image and text matching, in this paper, we study the problem from a causal perspective: the erroneous semantics of individual entities are essentially confounders that cause the matching failure. Therefore, we propose a novel \textbf{\textit{training-free}} compositional CLIP model (ComCLIP). ComCLIP disentangles input images into subjects, objects, and action sub-images and composes CLIP's vision encoder and text encoder to perform evolving matching over compositional text embedding and sub-image embeddings. In this way, ComCLIP can mitigate spurious correlations introduced by the pretrained CLIP models and dynamically evaluate the importance of each component. Experiments on four compositional image-text matching datasets: SVO, ComVG, Winoground, and VL-checklist, and two general image-text retrieval datasets: Flick30K, and MSCOCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our plug-and-play method, which boosts the \textbf{\textit{zero-shot}} inference ability of CLIP, SLIP, and BLIP2 even without further training or fine-tuning. Our codes can be found at https://github.com/eric-ai-lab/ComCLIP.</description>

      <title>CBNet: A Plug-and-Play Network for Segmentation-Based Scene Text Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, segmentation-based methods are quite popular in scene text detection, which mainly contain two steps: text kernel segmentation and expansion. However, the segmentation process only considers each pixel independently, and the expansion process is difficult to achieve a favorable accuracy-speed trade-off. In this paper, we propose a Context-aware and Boundary-guided Network (CBN) to tackle these problems. In CBN, a basic text detector is firstly used to predict initial segmentation results. Then, we propose a context-aware module to enhance text kernel feature representations, which considers both global and local contexts. Finally, we introduce a boundary-guided module to expand enhanced text kernels adaptively with only the pixels on the contours, which not only obtains accurate text boundaries but also keeps high speed, especially on high-resolution output maps. In particular, with a lightweight backbone, the basic detector equipped with our proposed CBN achieves state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks, and our proposed CBN can be plugged into several segmentation-based methods.

      <description>arXiv:2303.13800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal alignment facilitates the retrieval of instances from one modality when queried using another. In this paper, we consider a novel setting where such an alignment is between (i) instruction steps that are depicted as assembly diagrams (commonly seen in Ikea assembly manuals) and (ii) video segments from in-the-wild videos; these videos comprising an enactment of the assembly actions in the real world. To learn this alignment, we introduce a novel supervised contrastive learning method that learns to align videos with the subtle details in the assembly diagrams, guided by a set of novel losses. To study this problem and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we introduce a novel dataset: IAW for Ikea assembly in the wild consisting of 183 hours of videos from diverse furniture assembly collections and nearly 8,300 illustrations from their associated instruction manuals and annotated for their ground truth alignments. We define two tasks on this dataset: First, nearest neighbor retrieval between video segments and illustrations, and, second, alignment of instruction steps and the segments for each video. Extensive experiments on IAW demonstrate superior performances of our approach against alternatives.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Models can Identify Distracted Driver Behavior from Naturalistic Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10159v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recognizing the activities causing distraction in real-world driving scenarios is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of both drivers and pedestrians on the roadways. Conventional computer vision techniques are typically data-intensive and require a large volume of annotated training data to detect and classify various distracted driving behaviors, thereby limiting their efficiency and scalability. We aim to develop a generalized framework that showcases robust performance with access to limited or no annotated training data. Recently, vision-language models have offered large-scale visual-textual pretraining that can be adapted to task-specific learning like distracted driving activity recognition. Vision-language pretraining models, such as CLIP, have shown significant promise in learning natural language-guided visual representations. This paper proposes a CLIP-based driver activity recognition approach that identifies driver distraction from naturalistic driving images and videos. CLIP's vision embedding offers zero-shot transfer and task-based finetuning, which can classify distracted activities from driving video data. Our results show that this framework offers state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot transfer and video-based CLIP for predicting the driver's state on two public datasets. We propose both frame-based and video-based frameworks developed on top of the CLIP's visual representation for distracted driving detection and classification tasks and report the results.</description>

      <title>SwIPE: Efficient and Robust Medical Image Segmentation with Implicit Patch Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern medical image segmentation methods primarily use discrete representations in the form of rasterized masks to learn features and generate predictions. Although effective, this paradigm is spatially inflexible, scales poorly to higher-resolution images, and lacks direct understanding of object shapes. To address these limitations, some recent works utilized implicit neural representations (INRs) to learn continuous representations for segmentation. However, these methods often directly adopted components designed for 3D shape reconstruction. More importantly, these formulations were also constrained to either point-based or global contexts, lacking contextual understanding or local fine-grained details, respectively--both critical for accurate segmentation. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach, SwIPE (Segmentation with Implicit Patch Embeddings), that leverages the advantages of INRs and predicts shapes at the patch level--rather than at the point level or image level--to enable both accurate local boundary delineation and global shape coherence. Extensive evaluations on two tasks (2D polyp segmentation and 3D abdominal organ segmentation) show that SwIPE significantly improves over recent implicit approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art discrete methods with over 10x fewer parameters. Our method also demonstrates superior data efficiency and improved robustness to data shifts across image resolutions and datasets.

      <description>arXiv:2308.08325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: News Image Captioning aims to create captions from news articles and images, emphasizing the connection between textual context and visual elements. Recognizing the significance of human faces in news images and the face-name co-occurrence pattern in existing datasets, we propose a face-naming module for learning better name embeddings. Apart from names, which can be directly linked to an image area (faces), news image captions mostly contain context information that can only be found in the article. We design a retrieval strategy using CLIP to retrieve sentences that are semantically close to the image, mimicking human thought process of linking articles to images. Furthermore, to tackle the problem of the imbalanced proportion of article context and image context in captions, we introduce a simple yet effective method Contrasting with Language Model backbone (CoLaM) to the training pipeline. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our framework. We out-perform the previous state-of-the-art (without external data) by 7.97/5.80 CIDEr scores on GoodNews/NYTimes800k.

      <title>Semantics Meets Temporal Correspondence: Self-supervised Object-centric Learning in Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised methods have shown remarkable progress in learning high-level semantics and low-level temporal correspondence. Building on these results, we take one step further and explore the possibility of integrating these two features to enhance object-centric representations. Our preliminary experiments indicate that query slot attention can extract different semantic components from the RGB feature map, while random sampling based slot attention can exploit temporal correspondence cues between frames to assist instance identification. Motivated by this, we propose a novel semantic-aware masked slot attention on top of the fused semantic features and correspondence maps. It comprises two slot attention stages with a set of shared learnable Gaussian distributions. In the first stage, we use the mean vectors as slot initialization to decompose potential semantics and generate semantic segmentation masks through iterative attention. In the second stage, for each semantics, we randomly sample slots from the corresponding Gaussian distribution and perform masked feature aggregation within the semantic area to exploit temporal correspondence patterns for instance identification. We adopt semantic- and instance-level temporal consistency as self-supervision to encourage temporally coherent object-centric representations. Our model effectively identifies multiple object instances with semantic structure, reaching promising results on unsupervised video object discovery. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on dense label propagation tasks, demonstrating the potential for object-centric analysis.

      <description>arXiv:2308.13223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While image diffusion models have made significant progress in text-driven 3D content creation, they often fail to accurately capture the intended meaning of text prompts, especially for view information. This limitation leads to the Janus problem, where multi-faced 3D models are generated under the guidance of such diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a robust high-quality 3D content generation pipeline by exploiting orthogonal-view image guidance. First, we introduce a novel 2D diffusion model that generates an image consisting of four orthogonal-view sub-images based on the given text prompt. Then, the 3D content is created using this diffusion model. Notably, the generated orthogonal-view image provides strong geometric structure priors and thus improves 3D consistency. As a result, it effectively resolves the Janus problem and significantly enhances the quality of 3D content creation. Additionally, we present a 3D synthesis fusion network that can further improve the details of the generated 3D contents. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our method surpasses previous text-to-3D techniques. Project page: https://efficientdreamer.github.io.</description>

      <title>An explainable three dimension framework to uncover learning patterns: A unified look in variable sulci recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable AI is crucial in medical imaging. In the challenging field of neuroscience, visual topics present a high level of complexity, particularly within three-dimensional space. The application of neuroscience, which involves identifying brain sulcal features from MRI, faces significant hurdles due to varying annotation protocols among experts and the intricate three-dimension functionality of the brain. Consequently, traditional explainability approaches fall short in effectively validating and evaluating these networks. To address this, we first present a mathematical formulation delineating various categories of explanation needs across diverse computer vision tasks, categorized into self-explanatory, semi-explanatory, non-explanatory, and new-pattern learning applications based on the reliability of the validation protocol. With respect to this mathematical formulation, we propose a 3D explainability framework aimed at validating the outputs of deep learning networks in detecting the paracingulate sulcus an essential brain anatomical feature. The framework integrates local 3D explanations, global explanations through dimensionality reduction, concatenated global explanations, and statistical shape features, unveiling new insights into pattern learning. We trained and tested two advanced 3D deep learning networks on the challenging TOP-OSLO dataset, significantly improving sulcus detection accuracy, particularly on the left hemisphere. During evaluation with diverse annotation protocols for this dataset, we highlighted the crucial role of an unbiased annotation process in achieving precise predictions and effective pattern learning within our proposed 3D framework. The proposed framework not only annotates the variable sulcus but also uncovers hidden AI knowledge, promising to advance our understanding of brain anatomy and function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06030v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We envision a system to continuously build and maintain a map based on earth-scale neural radiance fields (NeRF) using data collected from vehicles and drones in a lifelong learning manner. However, existing large-scale modeling by NeRF has problems in terms of scalability and maintainability when modeling earth-scale environments. Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a federated learning pipeline for large-scale modeling with NeRF. We tailor the model aggregation pipeline in federated learning for NeRF, thereby allowing local updates of NeRF. In the aggregation step, the accuracy of the clients' global pose is critical. Thus, we also propose global pose alignment to align the noisy global pose of clients before the aggregation step. In experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed pose alignment and the federated learning pipeline on the large-scale scene dataset, Mill19.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multimodal Cooperation via Fine-grained Modality Valuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One primary topic of multimodal learning is to jointly incorporate heterogeneous information from different modalities. However, most models often suffer from unsatisfactory multimodal cooperation, which cannot jointly utilize all modalities well. Some methods are proposed to identify and enhance the worse learnt modality, but they are often hard to provide the fine-grained observation of multimodal cooperation at sample-level with theoretical support. Hence, it is essential to reasonably observe and improve the fine-grained cooperation between modalities, especially when facing realistic scenarios where the modality discrepancy could vary across different samples. To this end, we introduce a sample-level modality valuation metric to evaluate the contribution of each modality for each sample. Via modality valuation, we observe that modality discrepancy indeed could be different at sample-level, beyond the global contribution discrepancy at dataset-level. We further analyze this issue and improve cooperation between modalities at sample-level by enhancing the discriminative ability of low-contributing modalities in a targeted manner. Overall, our methods reasonably observe the fine-grained uni-modal contribution and achieve considerable improvement. The source code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/Valuate-and-Enhance-Multimodal-Cooperation}.</description>

      <title>ShaDocFormer: A Shadow-Attentive Threshold Detector With Cascaded Fusion Refiner for Document Shadow Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Document shadow is a common issue that arises when capturing documents using mobile devices, which significantly impacts readability. Current methods encounter various challenges, including inaccurate detection of shadow masks and estimation of illumination. In this paper, we propose ShaDocFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that integrates traditional methodologies and deep learning techniques to tackle the problem of document shadow removal. The ShaDocFormer architecture comprises two components: the Shadow-attentive Threshold Detector (STD) and the Cascaded Fusion Refiner (CFR). The STD module employs a traditional thresholding technique and leverages the attention mechanism of the Transformer to gather global information, thereby enabling precise detection of shadow masks. The cascaded and aggregative structure of the CFR module facilitates a coarse-to-fine restoration process for the entire image. As a result, ShaDocFormer excels in accurately detecting and capturing variations in both shadow and illumination, thereby enabling effective removal of shadows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShaDocFormer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative measurements.</description>

Abstract: Bio-inspired neuromorphic cameras asynchronously record pixel brightness changes and generate sparse event streams. They can capture dynamic scenes with little motion blur and more details in extreme illumination conditions. Due to the multidimensional address-event structure, most existing vision algorithms cannot properly handle asynchronous event streams. While several event representations and processing methods have been developed to address such an issue, they are typically driven by a large number of events, leading to substantial overheads in runtime and memory. In this paper, we propose a new graph representation of the event data and couple it with a Graph Transformer to perform accurate neuromorphic classification. Extensive experiments show that our approach leads to better results and excels at the challenging realistic situations where only a small number of events and limited computational resources are available, paving the way for neuromorphic applications embedded into mobile facilities.</description>

      <title>ED-NeRF: Efficient Text-Guided Editing of 3D Scene with Latent Space NeRF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a significant advancement in text-to-image diffusion models, leading to groundbreaking performance in 2D image generation. These advancements have been extended to 3D models, enabling the generation of novel 3D objects from textual descriptions. This has evolved into NeRF editing methods, which allow the manipulation of existing 3D objects through textual conditioning. However, existing NeRF editing techniques have faced limitations in their performance due to slow training speeds and the use of loss functions that do not adequately consider editing. To address this, here we present a novel 3D NeRF editing approach dubbed ED-NeRF by successfully embedding real-world scenes into the latent space of the latent diffusion model (LDM) through a unique refinement layer. This approach enables us to obtain a NeRF backbone that is not only faster but also more amenable to editing compared to traditional image space NeRF editing. Furthermore, we propose an improved loss function tailored for editing by migrating the delta denoising score (DDS) distillation loss, originally used in 2D image editing to the three-dimensional domain. This novel loss function surpasses the well-known score distillation sampling (SDS) loss in terms of suitability for editing purposes. Our experimental results demonstrate that ED-NeRF achieves faster editing speed while producing improved output quality compared to state-of-the-art 3D editing models.</description>

      <title>TiC-CLIP: Continual Training of CLIP Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Keeping large foundation models up to date on latest data is inherently expensive. To avoid the prohibitive costs of constantly retraining, it is imperative to continually train these models. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of any large scale continual learning benchmarks or baselines. We introduce the first set of web-scale Time-Continual (TiC) benchmarks for training vision-language models: TiC-DataComp, TiC-YFCC, and TiC-Redcaps. TiC-DataComp, our largest dataset, contains over 12.7B timestamped image-text pairs spanning 9 years (2014-2022). We first use our benchmarks to curate various dynamic evaluations to measure temporal robustness of existing models. We show OpenAI's CLIP (trained on data up to 2020) loses $\approx 8\%$ zero-shot accuracy on our curated retrieval task from 2021-2022 compared with more recently trained models in OpenCLIP repository. We then study how to efficiently train models on time-continuous data. We demonstrate that a simple rehearsal-based approach that continues training from the last checkpoint and replays old data reduces compute by $2.5\times$ when compared to the standard practice of retraining from scratch.

      <description>arXiv:2311.01623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video analytics is widely used in contemporary systems and services. At the forefront of video analytics are video queries that users develop to find objects of particular interest. Building upon the insight that video objects (e.g., human, animals, cars, etc.), the center of video analytics, are similar in spirit to objects modeled by traditional object-oriented languages, we propose to develop an object-oriented approach to video analytics. This approach, named VQPy, consists of a frontend$\unicode{x2015}$a Python variant with constructs that make it easy for users to express video objects and their interactions$\unicode{x2015}$as well as an extensible backend that can automatically construct and optimize pipelines based on video objects. We have implemented and open-sourced VQPy, which has been productized in Cisco as part of its DeepVision framework.</description>

      <title>Chat-UniVi: Unified Visual Representation Empowers Large Language Models with Image and Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive universal capabilities across a wide range of open-ended tasks and have extended their utility to encompass multimodal conversations. However, existing methods encounter challenges in effectively handling both image and video understanding, particularly with limited visual tokens. In this work, we introduce Chat-UniVi, a Unified Vision-language model capable of comprehending and engaging in conversations involving images and videos through a unified visual representation. Specifically, we employ a set of dynamic visual tokens to uniformly represent images and videos. This representation framework empowers the model to efficiently utilize a limited number of visual tokens to simultaneously capture the spatial details necessary for images and the comprehensive temporal relationship required for videos. Moreover, we leverage a multi-scale representation, enabling the model to perceive both high-level semantic concepts and low-level visual details. Notably, Chat-UniVi is trained on a mixed dataset containing both images and videos, allowing direct application to tasks involving both mediums without requiring any modifications. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Chat-UniVi consistently outperforms even existing methods exclusively designed for either images or videos. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Chat-UniVi.</description>

      <title>Active Prompt Learning in Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated notable progress in various zero-shot tasks, such as classification and retrieval. Despite their performance, because improving performance on new tasks requires task-specific knowledge, their adaptation is essential. While labels are needed for the adaptation, acquiring them is typically expensive. To overcome this challenge, active learning, a method of achieving a high performance by obtaining labels for a small number of samples from experts, has been studied. Active learning primarily focuses on selecting unlabeled samples for labeling and leveraging them to train models. In this study, we pose the question, "how can the pre-trained VLMs be adapted under the active learning framework?" In response to this inquiry, we observe that (1) simply applying a conventional active learning framework to pre-trained VLMs even may degrade performance compared to random selection because of the class imbalance in labeling candidates, and (2) the knowledge of VLMs can provide hints for achieving the balance before labeling. Based on these observations, we devise a novel active learning framework for VLMs, denoted as PCB. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on seven different real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that PCB surpasses conventional active learning and random sampling methods. Code will be available in https://github.com/kaist-dmlab/pcb .</description>

      <title>Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the emergence of the large-scale vision-language model (VLM), such as CLIP, has opened the way towards open-world object perception. Many works have explored the utilization of pre-trained VLM for the challenging open-vocabulary dense prediction task that requires perceiving diverse objects with novel classes at inference time. Existing methods construct experiments based on the public datasets of related tasks, which are not tailored for open vocabulary and rarely involve imperceptible objects camouflaged in complex scenes due to data collection bias and annotation costs. To fill in the gaps, we introduce a new task, open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation (OVCOS), and construct a large-scale complex scene dataset (\textbf{OVCamo}) containing 11,483 hand-selected images with fine annotations and corresponding object classes. Further, we build a strong single-stage open-vocabulary \underline{c}amouflaged \underline{o}bject \underline{s}egmentation transform\underline{er} baseline \textbf{OVCoser} attached to the parameter-fixed CLIP with iterative semantic guidance and structure enhancement. By integrating the guidance of class semantic knowledge and the supplement of visual structure cues from the edge and depth information, the proposed method can efficiently capture camouflaged objects. Moreover, this effective framework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of open-vocabulary semantic image segmentation by a large margin on our OVCamo dataset. With the proposed dataset and baseline, we hope that this new task with more practical value can further expand the research on open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks. The code and data will be available in the future.</description>

      <title>Point2RBox: Combine Knowledge from Synthetic Visual Patterns for End-to-end Oriented Object Detection with Single Point Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapidly increasing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent research involving weakly-supervised detectors for learning rotated box (RBox) from the horizontal box (HBox) has attracted more and more attention. In this paper, we explore a more challenging yet label-efficient setting, namely single point-supervised OOD, and present our approach called Point2RBox. Specifically, we propose to leverage two principles: 1) Synthetic pattern knowledge combination: By sampling around each labeled point on the image, we spread the object feature to synthetic visual patterns with known boxes to provide the knowledge for box regression. 2) Transform self-supervision: With a transformed input image (e.g. scaled/rotated), the output RBoxes are trained to follow the same transformation so that the network can perceive the relative size/rotation between objects. The detector is further enhanced by a few devised techniques to cope with peripheral issues, e.g. the anchor/layer assignment as the size of the object is not available in our point supervision setting. To our best knowledge, Point2RBox is the first end-to-end solution for point-supervised OOD. In particular, our method uses a lightweight paradigm, yet it achieves a competitive performance among point-supervised alternatives, 41.05%/27.62%/80.01% on DOTA/DIOR/HRSC datasets.</description>

      <title>Align before Adapt: Leveraging Entity-to-Region Alignments for Generalizable Video Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale visual-language pre-trained models have achieved significant success in various video tasks. However, most existing methods follow an "adapt then align" paradigm, which adapts pre-trained image encoders to model video-level representations and utilizes one-hot or text embedding of the action labels for supervision. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of mapping from static images to complicated activity concepts. In this paper, we propose a novel "Align before Adapt" (ALT) paradigm. Prior to adapting to video representation learning, we exploit the entity-to-region alignments for each frame. The alignments are fulfilled by matching the region-aware image embeddings to an offline-constructed text corpus. With the aligned entities, we feed their text embeddings to a transformer-based video adapter as the queries, which can help extract the semantics of the most important entities from a video to a vector. This paradigm reuses the visual-language alignment of VLP during adaptation and tries to explain an action by the underlying entities. This helps understand actions by bridging the gap with complex activity semantics, particularly when facing unfamiliar or unseen categories. ALT demonstrates competitive performance while maintaining remarkably low computational costs. In fully supervised experiments, it achieves 88.1% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 with only 4947 GFLOPs. Moreover, ALT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and few-shot experiments, emphasizing its superior generalizability across various learning scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have profoundly influenced medical fields, by providing tools to reduce clinical workloads. However, most AI models are constrained to execute unimodal tasks, in stark contrast to the comprehensive approaches utilized by medical professionals. To address this, here we present RO-LMM, a multi-purpose large multimodal model (LMM) tailored for the field of radiation oncology. This model covers series of tasks within clinical workflow, adept at clinical report summarization, radiation treatment plan suggestion, and plan-guided target volume segmentation. In particular, to perform consecutive clinical tasks, we further present a novel Consistency Embedding Fine-Tuning (CEFTune) technique, which boosts LMM's robustness to noisy inputs while preserving the capability of handling clean inputs, and transform this concept into LMM-driven segmentation framework as Consistency Embedding Segmentation~(CESEG). Experimental results on multi-centre cohorts demonstrate our RO-LMM's promising performance for multiple clinical tasks with generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Direct2.5: Diverse Text-to-3D Generation via Multi-view 2.5D Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have unveiled significant potential for the creation of 3D content. However, current methods either apply a pre-trained 2D diffusion model with the time-consuming score distillation sampling (SDS), or a direct 3D diffusion model trained on limited 3D data losing generation diversity. In this work, we approach the problem by employing a multi-view 2.5D diffusion fine-tuned from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model. The multi-view 2.5D diffusion directly models the structural distribution of 3D data, while still maintaining the strong generalization ability of the original 2D diffusion model, filling the gap between 2D diffusion-based and direct 3D diffusion-based methods for 3D content generation. During inference, multi-view normal maps are generated using the 2.5D diffusion, and a novel differentiable rasterization scheme is introduced to fuse the almost consistent multi-view normal maps into a consistent 3D model. We further design a normal-conditioned multi-view image generation module for fast appearance generation given the 3D geometry. Our method is a one-pass diffusion process and does not require any SDS optimization as post-processing. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that, our direct 2.5D generation with the specially-designed fusion scheme can achieve diverse, mode-seeking-free, and high-fidelity 3D content generation in only 10 seconds.

      <title>ColonNeRF: High-Fidelity Neural Reconstruction of Long Colonoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colonoscopy reconstruction is pivotal for diagnosing colorectal cancer. However, accurate long-sequence colonoscopy reconstruction faces three major challenges: (1) dissimilarity among segments of the colon due to its meandering and convoluted shape; (2) co-existence of simple and intricately folded geometry structures; (3) sparse viewpoints due to constrained camera trajectories. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new reconstruction framework based on neural radiance field (NeRF), named ColonNeRF, which leverages neural rendering for novel view synthesis of long-sequence colonoscopy. Specifically, to reconstruct the entire colon in a piecewise manner, our ColonNeRF introduces a region division and integration module, effectively reducing shape dissimilarity and ensuring geometric consistency in each segment. To learn both the simple and complex geometry in a unified framework, our ColonNeRF incorporates a multi-level fusion module that progressively models the colon regions from easy to hard. Additionally, to overcome the challenges from sparse views, we devise a DensiNet module for densifying camera poses under the guidance of semantic consistency. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate our ColonNeRF. Quantitatively, ColonNeRF exhibits a 67%-85% increase in LPIPS-ALEX scores. Qualitatively, our reconstruction visualizations show much clearer textures and more accurate geometric details. These sufficiently demonstrate our superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>GIVT: Generative Infinite-Vocabulary Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce generative infinite-vocabulary transformers (GIVT) which generate vector sequences with real-valued entries, instead of discrete tokens from a finite vocabulary. To this end, we propose two surprisingly simple modifications to decoder-only transformers: 1) at the input, we replace the finite-vocabulary lookup table with a linear projection of the input vectors; and 2) at the output, we replace the logits prediction (usually mapped to a categorical distribution) with the parameters of a multivariate Gaussian mixture model. Inspired by the image-generation paradigm of VQ-GAN and MaskGIT, where transformers are used to model the discrete latent sequences of a VQ-VAE, we use GIVT to model the unquantized real-valued latent sequences of a $\beta$-VAE. In class-conditional image generation GIVT outperforms VQ-GAN (and improved variants thereof) as well as MaskGIT, and achieves performance competitive with recent latent diffusion models. Finally, we obtain strong results outside of image generation when applying GIVT to panoptic segmentation and depth estimation with a VAE variant of the UViM framework</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for video action recognition. Our approach, which we call UNITE, uses an image teacher model to adapt a video student model to the target domain. UNITE first employs self-supervised pre-training to promote discriminative feature learning on target domain videos using a teacher-guided masked distillation objective. We then perform self-training on masked target data, using the video student model and image teacher model together to generate improved pseudolabels for unlabeled target videos. Our self-training process successfully leverages the strengths of both models to achieve strong transfer performance across domains. We evaluate our approach on multiple video domain adaptation benchmarks and observe significant improvements upon previously reported results.</description>

      <title>AVID: Any-Length Video Inpainting with Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have successfully enabled text-guided image inpainting. While it seems straightforward to extend such editing capability into the video domain, there have been fewer works regarding text-guided video inpainting. Given a video, a masked region at its initial frame, and an editing prompt, it requires a model to do infilling at each frame following the editing guidance while keeping the out-of-mask region intact. There are three main challenges in text-guided video inpainting: ($i$) temporal consistency of the edited video, ($ii$) supporting different inpainting types at different structural fidelity levels, and ($iii$) dealing with variable video length. To address these challenges, we introduce Any-Length Video Inpainting with Diffusion Model, dubbed as AVID. At its core, our model is equipped with effective motion modules and adjustable structure guidance, for fixed-length video inpainting. Building on top of that, we propose a novel Temporal MultiDiffusion sampling pipeline with a middle-frame attention guidance mechanism, facilitating the generation of videos with any desired duration. Our comprehensive experiments show our model can robustly deal with various inpainting types at different video duration ranges, with high quality.

      <title>Prompt Highlighter: Interactive Control for Multi-Modal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study targets a critical aspect of multi-modal LLMs' (LLMs&amp;VLMs) inference: explicit controllable text generation. Multi-modal LLMs empower multi-modality understanding with the capability of semantic generation yet bring less explainability and heavier reliance on prompt contents due to their autoregressive generative nature. While manipulating prompt formats could improve outputs, designing specific and precise prompts per task can be challenging and ineffective. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel inference method, Prompt Highlighter, which enables users to highlight specific prompt spans to interactively control the focus during generation. Motivated by the classifier-free diffusion guidance, we form regular and unconditional context pairs based on highlighted tokens, demonstrating that the autoregressive generation in models can be guided in a classifier-free way. Notably, we find that, during inference, guiding the models with highlighted tokens through the attention weights leads to more desired outputs. Our approach is compatible with current LLMs and VLMs, achieving impressive customized generation results without training. Experiments confirm its effectiveness in focusing on input contexts and generating reliable content. Without tuning on LLaVA-v1.5, our method secured 70.7 in the MMBench test and 1552.5 in MME-perception. The code is available at: https://github.com/dvlab-research/Prompt-Highlighter/</description>

      <title>Towards a Perceptual Evaluation Framework for Lighting Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Progress in lighting estimation is tracked by computing existing image quality assessment (IQA) metrics on images from standard datasets. While this may appear to be a reasonable approach, we demonstrate that doing so does not correlate to human preference when the estimated lighting is used to relight a virtual scene into a real photograph. To study this, we design a controlled psychophysical experiment where human observers must choose their preference amongst rendered scenes lit using a set of lighting estimation algorithms selected from the recent literature, and use it to analyse how these algorithms perform according to human perception. Then, we demonstrate that none of the most popular IQA metrics from the literature, taken individually, correctly represent human perception. Finally, we show that by learning a combination of existing IQA metrics, we can more accurately represent human preference. This provides a new perceptual framework to help evaluate future lighting estimation algorithms.</description>

      <title>R2Human: Real-Time 3D Human Appearance Rendering from a Single Image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rendering 3D human appearance in different views is crucial for achieving holographic communication and immersive VR/AR. Existing methods either rely on multi-camera setups or have low-quality rendered images from a single image. In this paper, we propose R2Human, the first approach for real-time inference and rendering of photorealistic 3D human appearance from a single image. The core of our approach is to combine the strengths of implicit texture fields and explicit neural rendering with our novel representation, namely Z-map. Based on this, we present an end-to-end network that performs high-fidelity color reconstruction of visible areas and provides reliable color inference for occluded regions. To further enhance the 3D perception ability of our network, we leverage the Fourier occupancy field as a prior for generating the texture field and providing a sampling surface in the rendering stage. We also propose a consistency loss and a spatio-temporal fusion strategy to ensure the multi-view coherence. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and challenging real-world images, in real time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Recon3DMind, an innovative task aimed at reconstructing 3D visuals from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals, marking a significant advancement in the fields of cognitive neuroscience and computer vision. To support this pioneering task, we present the fMRI-Shape dataset, which includes data from 14 participants and features 360-degree videos of 3D objects to enable comprehensive fMRI signal capture across various settings, thereby laying a foundation for future research. Furthermore, we propose MinD-3D, a novel and effective three-stage framework specifically designed to decode the brain's 3D visual information from fMRI signals, demonstrating the feasibility of this challenging task. The framework begins by extracting and aggregating features from fMRI frames through a neuro-fusion encoder, subsequently employs a feature bridge diffusion model to generate visual features, and ultimately recovers the 3D object via a generative transformer decoder. We assess the performance of MinD-3D using a suite of semantic and structural metrics and analyze the correlation between the features extracted by our model and the visual regions of interest (ROIs) in fMRI signals. Our findings indicate that MinD-3D not only reconstructs 3D objects with high semantic relevance and spatial similarity but also significantly enhances our understanding of the human brain's capabilities in processing 3D visual information.

      <title>Unveiling Parts Beyond Objects:Towards Finer-Granularity Referring Expression Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Referring expression segmentation (RES) aims at segmenting the foreground masks of the entities that match the descriptive natural language expression. Previous datasets and methods for classic RES task heavily rely on the prior assumption that one expression must refer to object-level targets. In this paper, we take a step further to finer-grained part-level RES task. To promote the object-level RES task towards finer-grained vision-language understanding, we put forward a new multi-granularity referring expression segmentation (MRES) task and construct an evaluation benchmark called RefCOCOm by manual annotations. By employing our automatic model-assisted data engine, we build the largest visual grounding dataset namely MRES-32M, which comprises over 32.2M high-quality masks and captions on the provided 1M images. Besides, a simple yet strong model named UniRES is designed to accomplish the unified object-level and part-level grounding task. Extensive experiments on our RefCOCOm for MRES and three datasets (i.e., RefCOCO(+/g) for classic RES task demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art methods. To foster future research into fine-grained visual grounding, our benchmark RefCOCOm, the MRES-32M dataset and model UniRES will be publicly available at https://github.com/Rubics-Xuan/MRES</description>

      <title>Ins-HOI: Instance Aware Human-Object Interactions Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling detailed interactions between human/hand and object is an appealing yet challenging task. Current multi-view capture systems are only capable of reconstructing multiple subjects into a single, unified mesh, which fails to model the states of each instance individually during interactions. To address this, previous methods use template-based representations to track human/hand and object. However, the quality of the reconstructions is limited by the descriptive capabilities of the templates so that these methods are inherently struggle with geometry details, pressing deformations and invisible contact surfaces. In this work, we propose an end-to-end Instance-aware Human-Object Interactions recovery (Ins-HOI) framework by introducing an instance-level occupancy field representation. However, the real-captured data is presented as a holistic mesh, unable to provide instance-level supervision. To address this, we further propose a complementary training strategy that leverages synthetic data to introduce instance-level shape priors, enabling the disentanglement of occupancy fields for different instances. Specifically, synthetic data, created by randomly combining individual scans of humans/hands and objects, guides the network to learn a coarse prior of instances. Meanwhile, real-captured data helps in learning the overall geometry and restricting interpenetration in contact areas. As demonstrated in experiments, our method Ins-HOI supports instance-level reconstruction and provides reasonable and realistic invisible contact surfaces even in cases of extremely close interaction. To facilitate the research of this task, we collect a large-scale, high-fidelity 3D scan dataset, including 5.2k high-quality scans with real-world human-chair and hand-object interactions. The code and data will be public for research purposes.</description>

      <title>GSVA: Generalized Segmentation via Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES) extends the scope of classic RES to refer to multiple objects in one expression or identify the empty targets absent in the image. GRES poses challenges in modeling the complex spatial relationships of the instances in the image and identifying non-existing referents. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently shown tremendous progress in these complicated vision-language tasks. Connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision models, MLLMs are proficient in understanding contexts with visual inputs. Among them, LISA, as a representative, adopts a special [SEG] token to prompt a segmentation mask decoder, e.g., SAM, to enable MLLMs in the RES task. However, existing solutions to GRES remain unsatisfactory since current segmentation MLLMs cannot correctly handle the cases where users might reference multiple subjects in a singular prompt or provide descriptions incongruent with any image target. In this paper, we propose Generalized Segmentation Vision Assistant (GSVA) to address this gap. Specifically, GSVA reuses the [SEG] token to prompt the segmentation model towards supporting multiple mask references simultaneously and innovatively learns to generate a [REJ] token to reject the null targets explicitly. Experiments validate GSVA's efficacy in resolving the GRES issue, marking a notable enhancement and setting a new record on the GRES benchmark gRefCOCO dataset. GSVA also proves effective across various classic referring segmentation and comprehension tasks.</description>

      <title>Closing the Gap: Achieving Better Accuracy-Robustness Tradeoffs against Query-Based Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although promising, existing defenses against query-based attacks share a common limitation: they offer increased robustness against attacks at the price of a considerable accuracy drop on clean samples. In this work, we show how to efficiently establish, at test-time, a solid tradeoff between robustness and accuracy when mitigating query-based attacks. Given that these attacks necessarily explore low-confidence regions, our insight is that activating dedicated defenses, such as random noise defense and random image transformations, only for low-confidence inputs is sufficient to prevent them. Our approach is independent of training and supported by theory. We verify the effectiveness of our approach for various existing defenses by conducting extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Our results confirm that our proposal can indeed enhance these defenses by providing better tradeoffs between robustness and accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art approaches while being completely training-free.</description>

      <title>T-MAE: Temporal Masked Autoencoders for Point Cloud Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in LiDAR point cloud understanding hinders effective representation learning. Consequently, scholars have been actively investigating efficacious self-supervised pre-training paradigms. Nevertheless, temporal information, which is inherent in the LiDAR point cloud sequence, is consistently disregarded. To better utilize this property, we propose an effective pre-training strategy, namely Temporal Masked Auto-Encoders (T-MAE), which takes as input temporally adjacent frames and learns temporal dependency. A SiamWCA backbone, containing a Siamese encoder and a windowed cross-attention (WCA) module, is established for the two-frame input. Considering that the movement of an ego-vehicle alters the view of the same instance, temporal modeling also serves as a robust and natural data augmentation, enhancing the comprehension of target objects. SiamWCA is a powerful architecture but heavily relies on annotated data. Our T-MAE pre-training strategy alleviates its demand for annotated data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that T-MAE achieves the best performance on both Waymo and ONCE datasets among competitive self-supervised approaches.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Image Diffusion for Indoor Single-view Material Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Intrinsic Image Diffusion, a generative model for appearance decomposition of indoor scenes. Given a single input view, we sample multiple possible material explanations represented as albedo, roughness, and metallic maps. Appearance decomposition poses a considerable challenge in computer vision due to the inherent ambiguity between lighting and material properties and the lack of real datasets. To address this issue, we advocate for a probabilistic formulation, where instead of attempting to directly predict the true material properties, we employ a conditional generative model to sample from the solution space. Furthermore, we show that utilizing the strong learned prior of recent diffusion models trained on large-scale real-world images can be adapted to material estimation and highly improves the generalization to real images. Our method produces significantly sharper, more consistent, and more detailed materials, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by $1.5dB$ on PSNR and by $45\%$ better FID score on albedo prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in multi-modal conditioned face synthesis has enabled the creation of visually striking and accurately aligned facial images. Yet, current methods still face issues with scalability, limited flexibility, and a one-size-fits-all approach to control strength, not accounting for the differing levels of conditional entropy, a measure of unpredictability in data given some condition, across modalities. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel uni-modal training approach with modal surrogates, coupled with an entropy-aware modal-adaptive modulation, to support flexible, scalable, and scalable multi-modal conditioned face synthesis network. Our uni-modal training with modal surrogate that only leverage uni-modal data, use modal surrogate to decorate condition with modal-specific characteristic and serve as linker for inter-modal collaboration , fully learns each modality control in face synthesis process as well as inter-modal collaboration. The entropy-aware modal-adaptive modulation finely adjust diffusion noise according to modal-specific characteristics and given conditions, enabling well-informed step along denoising trajectory and ultimately leading to synthesis results of high fidelity and quality. Our framework improves multi-modal face synthesis under various conditions, surpassing current methods in image quality and fidelity, as demonstrated by our thorough experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of various self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs), focusing on their local representative power. Inspired by large language models, we examine the abilities of ViTs to perform various computer vision tasks with little to no fine-tuning. We design evaluation framework to analyze the quality of local, i.e.\ patch-level, representations in the context of few-shot semantic segmentation, instance identification, object retrieval and tracking. We discover that contrastive learning based methods like DINO produce more universal patch representations that can be immediately applied for downstream tasks with no parameter tuning, compared to masked image modeling. The embeddings learned using the latter approach, e.g. in masked autoencoders, have high variance features that harm distance-based algorithms, such as k-NN, and do not contain useful information for most downstream tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that removing these high-variance features enhances k-NN for MAE, as well as for its recent extension Scale-MAE. Finally, we find an object instance retrieval setting where DINOv2, a model pretrained on two orders of magnitude more data, falls short of its less compute intensive counterpart DINO.</description>

Abstract: FourCastNeXt is an optimization of FourCastNet - a global machine learning weather forecasting model - that performs with a comparable level of accuracy and can be trained using around 5% of the original FourCastNet computational requirements. This technical report presents strategies for model optimization that maintain similar performance as measured by the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the modelled variables. By providing a model with very low comparative training costs, FourCastNeXt makes Neural Earth System Modelling much more accessible to researchers looking to conduct training experiments and ablation studies.

      <title>Enhanced Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Ensemble Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually fit new classes with limited training data, while maintaining the performance of previously learned classes. The main challenges are overfitting the rare new training samples and forgetting old classes. While catastrophic forgetting has been extensively studied, the overfitting problem has attracted less attention in FSCIL. To tackle overfitting challenge, we design a new ensemble model framework cooperated with data augmentation to boost generalization. In this way, the enhanced model works as a library storing abundant features to guarantee fast adaptation to downstream tasks. Specifically, the multi-input multi-output ensemble structure is applied with a spatial-aware data augmentation strategy, aiming at diversifying the feature extractor and alleviating overfitting in incremental sessions. Moreover, self-supervised learning is also integrated to further improve the model generalization. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed method can indeed mitigate the overfitting problem in FSCIL, and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>PhotoBot: Reference-Guided Interactive Photography via Natural Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce PhotoBot, a framework for fully automated photo acquisition based on an interplay between high-level human language guidance and a robot photographer. We propose to communicate photography suggestions to the user via reference images that are selected from a curated gallery. We leverage a visual language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize the reference images via textual descriptions and then use a large language model (LLM) to retrieve relevant reference images based on a user's language query through text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference image and the observed scene, we exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing semantic similarity across marked appearance variations. Using these features, we compute pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach using a manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by users themselves, as measured by human feedback. We also show that PhotoBot can generalize to other reference sources such as paintings.</description>

      <title>Conditional Tuning Network for Few-Shot Adaptation of Segmentation Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capability and flexible geometric prompting in general image segmentation. However, SAM often struggles when handling various unconventional images, such as aerial, medical, and non-RGB images. This paper presents CAT-SAM, a ConditionAl Tuning network that adapts SAM toward various unconventional target tasks with just few-shot target samples. CAT-SAM freezes the entire SAM and adapts its mask decoder and image encoder simultaneously with a small number of learnable parameters. The core design is a prompt bridge structure that enables decoder-conditioned joint tuning of the heavyweight image encoder and the lightweight mask decoder. The bridging maps the prompt token of the mask decoder to the image encoder, fostering synergic adaptation of the encoder and the decoder with mutual benefits. We develop two representative tuning strategies for the image encoder which leads to two CAT-SAM variants: one injecting learnable prompt tokens in the input space and the other inserting lightweight adapter networks. Extensive experiments over 11 unconventional tasks show that both CAT-SAM variants achieve superior target segmentation performance consistently even under the very challenging one-shot adaptation setup.

      <title>To use or not to use proprietary street view images in (health and place) research? That is the question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer vision-based analysis of street view imagery has transformative impacts on environmental assessments. Interactive web services, particularly Google Street View, play an ever-important role in making imagery data ubiquitous. Despite the technical ease of harnessing millions of Google Street View images, this article questions the current practices in using this proprietary data source from a European viewpoint. Our concern lies with Google's terms of service, which restrict bulk image downloads and the generation of street view image-based indices. To reconcile the challenge of advancing society through groundbreaking research while maintaining data license agreements and legal integrity, we believe it is crucial to 1) include an author's statement on using proprietary street view data and the directives it entails, 2) negotiate academic-specific license to democratize Google Street View data access, and 3) adhere to open data principles and utilize open image sources for future research.</description>

      <title>NocPlace: Nocturnal Visual Place Recognition via Generative and Inherited Knowledge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial in computer vision, aiming to retrieve database images similar to a query image from an extensive collection of known images. However, like many vision tasks, VPR always degrades at night due to the scarcity of nighttime images. Moreover, VPR needs to address the cross-domain problem of night-to-day rather than just the issue of a single nighttime domain. In response to these issues, we present NocPlace, which leverages generative and inherited knowledge transfer to embed resilience against dazzling lights and extreme darkness in the global descriptor. First, we establish a day-night urban scene dataset called NightCities, capturing diverse lighting variations and dark scenarios across 60 cities globally. Then, an image generation network is trained on this dataset and processes a large-scale VPR dataset, obtaining its nighttime version. Finally, VPR models are fine-tuned using descriptors inherited from themselves and night-style images, which builds explicit cross-domain contrastive relationships. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate our contributions and the superiority of NocPlace. Without adding any real-time computing resources, NocPlace improves the performance of Eigenplaces by 7.6% on Tokyo 24/7 Night and 16.8% on SVOX Night.</description>

      <title>ICP-Flow: LiDAR Scene Flow Estimation with ICP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene flow characterizes the 3D motion between two LiDAR scans captured by an autonomous vehicle at nearby timesteps. Prevalent methods consider scene flow as point-wise unconstrained flow vectors that can be learned by either large-scale training beforehand or time-consuming optimization at inference. However, these methods do not take into account that objects in autonomous driving often move rigidly. We incorporate this rigid-motion assumption into our design, where the goal is to associate objects over scans and then estimate the locally rigid transformations. We propose ICP-Flow, a learning-free flow estimator. The core of our design is the conventional Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, which aligns the objects over time and outputs the corresponding rigid transformations. Crucially, to aid ICP, we propose a histogram-based initialization that discovers the most likely translation, thus providing a good starting point for ICP. The complete scene flow is then recovered from the rigid transformations. We outperform state-of-the-art baselines, including supervised models, on the Waymo dataset and perform competitively on Argoverse-v2 and nuScenes. Further, we train a feedforward neural network, supervised by the pseudo labels from our model, and achieve top performance among all models capable of real-time inference. We validate the advantage of our model on scene flow estimation with longer temporal gaps, up to 0.4 seconds where other models fail to deliver meaningful results.</description>

      <title>Instance-aware Exploration-Verification-Exploitation for Instance ImageGoal Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a new embodied vision task, Instance ImageGoal Navigation (IIN) aims to navigate to a specified object depicted by a goal image in an unexplored environment.
  The main challenge of this task lies in identifying the target object from different viewpoints while rejecting similar distractors.
  Existing ImageGoal Navigation methods usually adopt the simple Exploration-Exploitation framework and ignore the identification of specific instance during navigation.
  In this work, we propose to imitate the human behaviour of ``getting closer to confirm" when distinguishing objects from a distance.
  Specifically, we design a new modular navigation framework named Instance-aware Exploration-Verification-Exploitation (IEVE) for instance-level image goal navigation.
  Our method allows for active switching among the exploration, verification, and exploitation actions, thereby facilitating the agent in making reasonable decisions under different situations.
  On the challenging HabitatMatterport 3D semantic (HM3D-SEM) dataset, our method surpasses previous state-of-the-art work, with a classical segmentation model (0.684 vs. 0.561 success) or a robust model (0.702 vs. 0.561 success). Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/XiaohanLei/IEVE.</description>

      <title>Separate and Conquer: Decoupling Co-occurrence via Decomposition and Representation for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels aims to achieve segmentation tasks without dense annotations. However, attributed to the frequent coupling of co-occurring objects and the limited supervision from image-level labels, the challenging co-occurrence problem is widely present and leads to false activation of objects in WSSS. In this work, we devise a 'Separate and Conquer' scheme SeCo to tackle this issue from dimensions of image space and feature space. In the image space, we propose to 'separate' the co-occurring objects with image decomposition by subdividing images into patches. Importantly, we assign each patch a category tag from Class Activation Maps (CAMs), which spatially helps remove the co-context bias and guide the subsequent representation. In the feature space, we propose to 'conquer' the false activation by enhancing semantic representation with multi-granularity knowledge contrast. To this end, a dual-teacher-single-student architecture is designed and tag-guided contrast is conducted, which guarantee the correctness of knowledge and further facilitate the discrepancy among co-contexts. We streamline the multi-staged WSSS pipeline end-to-end and tackle this issue without external supervision. Extensive experiments are conducted, validating the efficiency of our method and the superiority over previous single-staged and even multi-staged competitors on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. Code is available at https://github.com/zwyang6/SeCo.git.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Typographic Deceptions: Insights of the Typographic Vulnerability in Large Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) rely on vision encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) to exhibit remarkable capabilities on various multi-modal tasks in the joint space of vision and language. However, the Typographic Attack, which disrupts vision-language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), has also been expected to be a security threat to LVLMs. Firstly, we verify typographic attacks on current well-known commercial and open-source LVLMs and uncover the widespread existence of this threat. Secondly, to better assess this vulnerability, we propose the most comprehensive and largest-scale Typographic Dataset to date. The Typographic Dataset not only considers the evaluation of typographic attacks under various multi-modal tasks but also evaluates the effects of typographic attacks, influenced by texts generated with diverse factors. Based on the evaluation results, we investigate the causes why typographic attacks may impact VLMs and LVLMs, leading to three highly insightful discoveries. By the examination of our discoveries and experimental validation in the Typographic Dataset, we reduce the performance degradation from $42.07\%$ to $13.90\%$ when LVLMs confront typographic attacks.</description>

      <title>The All-Seeing Project V2: Towards General Relation Comprehension of the Open World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the All-Seeing Project V2: a new model and dataset designed for understanding object relations in images. Specifically, we propose the All-Seeing Model V2 (ASMv2) that integrates the formulation of text generation, object localization, and relation comprehension into a relation conversation (ReC) task. Leveraging this unified task, our model excels not only in perceiving and recognizing all objects within the image but also in grasping the intricate relation graph between them, diminishing the relation hallucination often encountered by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To facilitate training and evaluation of MLLMs in relation understanding, we created the first high-quality ReC dataset ({AS-V2) which is aligned with the format of standard instruction tuning data. In addition, we design a new benchmark, termed Circular-based Relation Probing Evaluation (CRPE) for comprehensively evaluating the relation comprehension capabilities of MLLMs. Notably, our ASMv2 achieves an overall accuracy of 52.04 on this relation-aware benchmark, surpassing the 43.14 of LLaVA-1.5 by a large margin. We hope that our work can inspire more future research and contribute to the evolution towards artificial general intelligence. Our project is released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/all-seeing.</description>

      <title>A Generative Approach for Wikipedia-Scale Visual Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address web-scale visual entity recognition, specifically the task of mapping a given query image to one of the 6 million existing entities in Wikipedia. One way of approaching a problem of such scale is using dual-encoder models (eg CLIP), where all the entity names and query images are embedded into a unified space, paving the way for an approximate k-NN search. Alternatively, it is also possible to re-purpose a captioning model to directly generate the entity names for a given image. In contrast, we introduce a novel Generative Entity Recognition (GER) framework, which given an input image learns to auto-regressively decode a semantic and discriminative ``code'' identifying the target entity. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this GER paradigm, showcasing state-of-the-art performance on the challenging OVEN benchmark. GER surpasses strong captioning, dual-encoder, visual matching and hierarchical classification baselines, affirming its advantage in tackling the complexities of web-scale recognition.</description>

      <title>Beyond Specialization: Assessing the Capabilities of MLLMs in Age and Gender Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently gained immense popularity. Powerful commercial models like ChatGPT-4V and Gemini, as well as open-source ones such as LLaVA, are essentially general-purpose models and are applied to solve a wide variety of tasks, including those in computer vision. These neural networks possess such strong general knowledge and reasoning abilities that they have proven capable of working even on tasks for which they were not specifically trained. We compared the capabilities of the most powerful MLLMs to date: ShareGPT4V, ChatGPT, LLaVA-Next in a specialized task of age and gender estimation with our state-of-the-art specialized model, MiVOLO. We also updated MiVOLO and provide details and new metrics in this article. This comparison has yielded some interesting results and insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the participating models. Furthermore, we attempted various ways to fine-tune the ShareGPT4V model for this specific task, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in this particular challenge. Although such a model would not be practical in production, as it is incredibly expensive compared to a specialized model like MiVOLO, it could be very useful in some tasks, like data annotation.</description>

      <title>OmniCount: Multi-label Object Counting with Semantic-Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object counting is pivotal for understanding the composition of scenes. Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a new, more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging point prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions and heralding a new era in object counting technology.</description>

      <title>How to Handle Sketch-Abstraction in Sketch-Based Image Retrieval?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel abstraction-aware sketch-based image retrieval framework capable of handling sketch abstraction at varied levels. Prior works had mainly focused on tackling sub-factors such as drawing style and order, we instead attempt to model abstraction as a whole, and propose feature-level and retrieval granularity-level designs so that the system builds into its DNA the necessary means to interpret abstraction. On learning abstraction-aware features, we for the first-time harness the rich semantic embedding of pre-trained StyleGAN model, together with a novel abstraction-level mapper that deciphers the level of abstraction and dynamically selects appropriate dimensions in the feature matrix correspondingly, to construct a feature matrix embedding that can be freely traversed to accommodate different levels of abstraction. For granularity-level abstraction understanding, we dictate that the retrieval model should not treat all abstraction-levels equally and introduce a differentiable surrogate Acc.@q loss to inject that understanding into the system. Different to the gold-standard triplet loss, our Acc.@q loss uniquely allows a sketch to narrow/broaden its focus in terms of how stringent the evaluation should be - the more abstract a sketch, the less stringent (higher q). Extensive experiments depict our method to outperform existing state-of-the-arts in standard SBIR tasks along with challenging scenarios like early retrieval, forensic sketch-photo matching, and style-invariant retrieval.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Image Diffusion Models are Great Sketch-Photo Matchmakers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper, for the first time, explores text-to-image diffusion models for Zero-Shot Sketch-based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR). We highlight a pivotal discovery: the capacity of text-to-image diffusion models to seamlessly bridge the gap between sketches and photos. This proficiency is underpinned by their robust cross-modal capabilities and shape bias, findings that are substantiated through our pilot studies. In order to harness pre-trained diffusion models effectively, we introduce a straightforward yet powerful strategy focused on two key aspects: selecting optimal feature layers and utilising visual and textual prompts. For the former, we identify which layers are most enriched with information and are best suited for the specific retrieval requirements (category-level or fine-grained). Then we employ visual and textual prompts to guide the model's feature extraction process, enabling it to generate more discriminative and contextually relevant cross-modal representations. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>You'll Never Walk Alone: A Sketch and Text Duet for Fine-Grained Image Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two primary input modalities prevail in image retrieval: sketch and text. While text is widely used for inter-category retrieval tasks, sketches have been established as the sole preferred modality for fine-grained image retrieval due to their ability to capture intricate visual details. In this paper, we question the reliance on sketches alone for fine-grained image retrieval by simultaneously exploring the fine-grained representation capabilities of both sketch and text, orchestrating a duet between the two. The end result enables precise retrievals previously unattainable, allowing users to pose ever-finer queries and incorporate attributes like colour and contextual cues from text. For this purpose, we introduce a novel compositionality framework, effectively combining sketches and text using pre-trained CLIP models, while eliminating the need for extensive fine-grained textual descriptions. Last but not least, our system extends to novel applications in composed image retrieval, domain attribute transfer, and fine-grained generation, providing solutions for various real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>It's All About Your Sketch: Democratising Sketch Control in Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper unravels the potential of sketches for diffusion models, addressing the deceptive promise of direct sketch control in generative AI. We importantly democratise the process, enabling amateur sketches to generate precise images, living up to the commitment of "what you sketch is what you get". A pilot study underscores the necessity, revealing that deformities in existing models stem from spatial-conditioning. To rectify this, we propose an abstraction-aware framework, utilising a sketch adapter, adaptive time-step sampling, and discriminative guidance from a pre-trained fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval model, working synergistically to reinforce fine-grained sketch-photo association. Our approach operates seamlessly during inference without the need for textual prompts; a simple, rough sketch akin to what you and I can create suffices! We welcome everyone to examine results presented in the paper and its supplementary. Contributions include democratising sketch control, introducing an abstraction-aware framework, and leveraging discriminative guidance, validated through extensive experiments.</description>

Abstract: Due to the influence of imaging equipment and complex imaging environments, most images in daily life have features of intensity inhomogeneity and noise. Therefore, many scholars have designed many image segmentation algorithms to address these issues. Among them, the active contour model is one of the most effective image segmentation algorithms.This paper proposes an active contour model driven by the hybrid signed pressure function that combines global and local information construction. Firstly, a new global region-based signed pressure function is introduced by combining the average intensity of the inner and outer regions of the curve with the median intensity of the inner region of the evolution curve. Then, the paper uses the energy differences between the inner and outer regions of the curve in the local region to design the signed pressure function of the local term. Combine the two SPF function to obtain a new signed pressure function and get the evolution equation of the new model. Finally, experiments and numerical analysis show that the model has excellent segmentation performance for both intensity inhomogeneous images and noisy images.</description>

      <title>A Fourier Transform Framework for Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), knowledge can be transferred from a label-rich source domain to a target domain that contains relevant information but lacks labels. Many existing UDA algorithms suffer from directly using raw images as input, resulting in models that overly focus on redundant information and exhibit poor generalization capability. To address this issue, we attempt to improve the performance of unsupervised domain adaptation by employing the Fourier method (FTF).Specifically, FTF is inspired by the amplitude of Fourier spectra, which primarily preserves low-level statistical information. In FTF, we effectively incorporate low-level information from the target domain into the source domain by fusing the amplitudes of both domains in the Fourier domain. Additionally, we observe that extracting features from batches of images can eliminate redundant information while retaining class-specific features relevant to the task. Building upon this observation, we apply the Fourier Transform at the data stream level for the first time. To further align multiple sources of data, we introduce the concept of correlation alignment. To evaluate the effectiveness of our FTF method, we conducted evaluations on four benchmark datasets for domain adaptation, including Office-31, Office-Home, ImageCLEF-DA, and Office-Caltech. Our results demonstrate superior performance.</description>

      <title>MRC-Net: 6-DoF Pose Estimation with MultiScale Residual Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a single-shot approach to determining 6-DoF pose of an object with available 3D computer-aided design (CAD) model from a single RGB image. Our method, dubbed MRC-Net, comprises two stages. The first performs pose classification and renders the 3D object in the classified pose. The second stage performs regression to predict fine-grained residual pose within class. Connecting the two stages is a novel multi-scale residual correlation (MRC) layer that captures high-and-low level correspondences between the input image and rendering from first stage. MRC-Net employs a Siamese network with shared weights between both stages to learn embeddings for input and rendered images. To mitigate ambiguity when predicting discrete pose class labels on symmetric objects, we use soft probabilistic labels to define pose class in the first stage. We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming all competing RGB-based methods on four challenging BOP benchmark datasets: T-LESS, LM-O, YCB-V, and ITODD. Our method is non-iterative and requires no complex post-processing.</description>

      <title>BiTT: Bi-directional Texture Reconstruction of Interacting Two Hands from a Single Image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating personalized hand avatars is important to offer a realistic experience to users on AR / VR platforms. While most prior studies focused on reconstructing 3D hand shapes, some recent work has tackled the reconstruction of hand textures on top of shapes. However, these methods are often limited to capturing pixels on the visible side of a hand, requiring diverse views of the hand in a video or multiple images as input. In this paper, we propose a novel method, BiTT(Bi-directional Texture reconstruction of Two hands), which is the first end-to-end trainable method for relightable, pose-free texture reconstruction of two interacting hands taking only a single RGB image, by three novel components: 1) bi-directional (left $\leftrightarrow$ right) texture reconstruction using the texture symmetry of left / right hands, 2) utilizing a texture parametric model for hand texture recovery, and 3) the overall coarse-to-fine stage pipeline for reconstructing personalized texture of two interacting hands. BiTT first estimates the scene light condition and albedo image from an input image, then reconstructs the texture of both hands through the texture parametric model and bi-directional texture reconstructor. In experiments using InterHand2.6M and RGB2Hands datasets, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hand texture reconstruction methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

      <title>m&amp;m's: A Benchmark to Evaluate Tool-Use for multi-step multi-modal Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world multi-modal problems are rarely solved by a single machine learning model, and often require multi-step computational plans that involve stitching several models. Tool-augmented LLMs hold tremendous promise for automating the generation of such computational plans. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating LLMs as planners for multi-step multi-modal tasks has prevented a systematic study of planner design decisions. Should LLMs generate a full plan in a single shot or step-by-step? Should they invoke tools directly with Python code or through structured data formats like JSON? Does feedback improve planning? To answer these questions and more, we introduce m&amp;m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasks involving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, and image processing modules. For each of these task queries, we provide automatically generated plans using this realistic toolset. We further provide a high-quality subset of 1,565 task plans that are human-verified and correctly executable. With m&amp;m's, we evaluate 6 popular LLMs with 2 planning strategies (multi-step vs. step-by-step planning), 2 plan formats (JSON vs. code), and 3 types of feedback (parsing/verification/execution). Finally, we summarize takeaways from our extensive experiments. Our dataset and code are available on HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/zixianma/mnms) and Github (https://github.com/RAIVNLab/mnms).</description>

      <title>Neural Markov Random Field for Stereo Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stereo matching is a core task for many computer vision and robotics applications. Despite their dominance in traditional stereo methods, the hand-crafted Markov Random Field (MRF) models lack sufficient modeling accuracy compared to end-to-end deep models. While deep learning representations have greatly improved the unary terms of the MRF models, the overall accuracy is still severely limited by the hand-crafted pairwise terms and message passing. To address these issues, we propose a neural MRF model, where both potential functions and message passing are designed using data-driven neural networks. Our fully data-driven model is built on the foundation of variational inference theory, to prevent convergence issues and retain stereo MRF's graph inductive bias. To make the inference tractable and scale well to high-resolution images, we also propose a Disparity Proposal Network (DPN) to adaptively prune the search space of disparity. The proposed approach ranks $1^{st}$ on both KITTI 2012 and 2015 leaderboards among all published methods while running faster than 100 ms. This approach significantly outperforms prior global methods, e.g., lowering D1 metric by more than 50% on KITTI 2015. In addition, our method exhibits strong cross-domain generalization and can recover sharp edges. The codes at https://github.com/aeolusguan/NMRF</description>

      <title>V2X-DGW: Domain Generalization for Multi-agent Perception under Adverse Weather Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current LiDAR-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) multi-agent perception systems have shown the significant success on 3D object detection. While these models perform well in the trained clean weather, they struggle in unseen adverse weather conditions with the real-world domain gap. In this paper, we propose a domain generalization approach, named V2X-DGW, for LiDAR-based 3D object detection on multi-agent perception system under adverse weather conditions. Not only in the clean weather does our research aim to ensure favorable multi-agent performance, but also in the unseen adverse weather conditions by learning only on the clean weather data. To advance research in this area, we have simulated the impact of three prevalent adverse weather conditions on two widely-used multi-agent datasets, resulting in the creation of two novel benchmark datasets: OPV2V-w and V2XSet-w.
  To this end, we first introduce the Adaptive Weather Augmentation (AWA) to mimic the unseen adverse weather conditions, and then propose two alignments for generalizable representation learning: Trust-region Weather-invariant Alignment (TWA) and Agent-aware Contrastive Alignment (ACA). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our V2X-DGW achieved improvements in the unseen adverse weather conditions.</description>

      <title>Implicit Discriminative Knowledge Learning for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging cross-modal pedestrian retrieval task, due to significant intra-class variations and cross-modal discrepancies among different cameras. Existing works mainly focus on embedding images of different modalities into a unified space to mine modality-shared features. They only seek distinctive information within these shared features, while ignoring the identity-aware useful information that is implicit in the modality-specific features. To address this issue, we propose a novel Implicit Discriminative Knowledge Learning (IDKL) network to uncover and leverage the implicit discriminative information contained within the modality-specific. First, we extract modality-specific and modality-shared features using a novel dual-stream network. Then, the modality-specific features undergo purification to reduce their modality style discrepancies while preserving identity-aware discriminative knowledge. Subsequently, this kind of implicit knowledge is distilled into the modality-shared feature to enhance its distinctiveness. Finally, an alignment loss is proposed to minimize modality discrepancy on enhanced modality-shared features. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the superiority of IDKL network over the state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/1KK077/IDKL.</description>

      <title>Discover and Mitigate Multiple Biased Subgroups in Image Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models can perform well on in-distribution data but often fail on biased subgroups that are underrepresented in the training data, hindering the robustness of models for reliable applications. Such subgroups are typically unknown due to the absence of subgroup labels. Discovering biased subgroups is the key to understanding models' failure modes and further improving models' robustness. Most previous works of subgroup discovery make an implicit assumption that models only underperform on a single biased subgroup, which does not hold on in-the-wild data where multiple biased subgroups exist.
  In this work, we propose Decomposition, Interpretation, and Mitigation (DIM), a novel method to address a more challenging but also more practical problem of discovering multiple biased subgroups in image classifiers. Our approach decomposes the image features into multiple components that represent multiple subgroups. This decomposition is achieved via a bilinear dimension reduction method, Partial Least Square (PLS), guided by useful supervision from the image classifier. We further interpret the semantic meaning of each subgroup component by generating natural language descriptions using vision-language foundation models. Finally, DIM mitigates multiple biased subgroups simultaneously via two strategies, including the data- and model-centric strategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Breeds datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DIM in discovering and mitigating multiple biased subgroups. Furthermore, DIM uncovers the failure modes of the classifier on Hard ImageNet, showcasing its broader applicability to understanding model bias in image classifiers.

      <title>Chain-of-Spot: Interactive Reasoning Improves Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of vision-language understanding, the proficiency of models in interpreting and reasoning over visual content has become a cornerstone for numerous applications. However, it is challenging for the visual encoder in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to extract useful features tailored to questions that aid the language model's response. Furthermore, a common practice among existing LVLMs is to utilize lower-resolution images, which restricts the ability for visual recognition. Our work introduces the Chain-of-Spot (CoS) method, which we describe as Interactive Reasoning, a novel approach that enhances feature extraction by focusing on key regions of interest (ROI) within the image, corresponding to the posed questions or instructions. This technique allows LVLMs to access more detailed visual information without altering the original image resolution, thereby offering multi-granularity image features. By integrating Chain-of-Spot with instruct-following LLaVA-1.5 models, the process of image reasoning consistently improves performance across a wide range of multimodal datasets and benchmarks without bells and whistles and achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our empirical findings demonstrate a significant improvement in LVLMs' ability to understand and reason about visual content, paving the way for more sophisticated visual instruction-following applications.

      <title>Self-Supervised Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction with Spatial and Temporal Consistency Regularizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perception of motion behavior in a dynamic environment holds significant importance for autonomous driving systems, wherein class-agnostic motion prediction methods directly predict the motion of the entire point cloud. While most existing methods rely on fully-supervised learning, the manual labeling of point cloud data is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, several annotation-efficient methods have been proposed to address this challenge. Although effective, these methods rely on weak annotations or additional multi-modal data like images, and the potential benefits inherent in the point cloud sequence are still underexplored. To this end, we explore the feasibility of self-supervised motion prediction with only unlabeled LiDAR point clouds. Initially, we employ an optimal transport solver to establish coarse correspondences between current and future point clouds as the coarse pseudo motion labels. Training models directly using such coarse labels leads to noticeable spatial and temporal prediction inconsistencies. To mitigate these issues, we introduce three simple spatial and temporal regularization losses, which facilitate the self-supervised training process effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.</description>

Abstract: Language-guided scene-aware human motion generation has great significance for entertainment and robotics. In response to the limitations of existing datasets, we introduce LaserHuman, a pioneering dataset engineered to revolutionize Scene-Text-to-Motion research. LaserHuman stands out with its inclusion of genuine human motions within 3D environments, unbounded free-form natural language descriptions, a blend of indoor and outdoor scenarios, and dynamic, ever-changing scenes. Diverse modalities of capture data and rich annotations present great opportunities for the research of conditional motion generation, and can also facilitate the development of real-life applications. Moreover, to generate semantically consistent and physically plausible human motions, we propose a multi-conditional diffusion model, which is simple but effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on existing datasets.</description>

      <title>AMP: Autoregressive Motion Prediction Revisited with Next Token Prediction for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an essential task in autonomous driving (AD), motion prediction aims to predict the future states of surround objects for navigation. One natural solution is to estimate the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner where each predicted time-step is conditioned on both observed time-steps and previously predicted time-steps, i.e., autoregressive prediction. Pioneering works like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition. However, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps are independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single linear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously. They dominate most motion prediction leaderboards due to the simplicity of training MLPs compared to autoregressive networks.
  In this paper, we introduce the GPT style next token prediction into motion forecasting. In this way, the input and output could be represented in a unified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible. However, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units -words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal and semantic relations. To this end, we propose to adopt three factorized attention modules with different neighbors for information aggregation and different position encoding styles to capture their relations, e.g., encoding the transformation between coordinate systems for spatial relativity while adopting RoPE for temporal relativity. Empirically, by equipping with the aforementioned tailored designs, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Waymo Open Motion and Waymo Interaction datasets. Notably, AMP outperforms other recent autoregressive motion prediction methods: MotionLM and StateTransformer, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed designs.</description>

Abstract: Humans can not only recognize and understand the world in its current state but also envision future scenarios that extend beyond immediate perception. To resemble this profound human capacity, we introduce zero-shot task hallucination -- given a single RGB image of any scene comprising unknown environments and objects, our model can identify potential tasks and imagine their execution in a vivid narrative, realized as a video. We develop a modular pipeline that progressively enhances scene decomposition, comprehension, and reconstruction, incorporating VLM for dynamic interaction and 3D motion planning for object trajectories. Our model can discover diverse tasks, with the generated task videos demonstrating realistic and compelling visual outcomes that are understandable by both machines and humans.

Abstract: Generating medical reports for X-ray images presents a significant challenge, particularly in unpaired scenarios where access to paired image-report data for training is unavailable. Previous works have typically learned a joint embedding space for images and reports, necessitating a specific labeling schema for both. We introduce an innovative approach that eliminates the need for consistent labeling schemas, thereby enhancing data accessibility and enabling the use of incompatible datasets. This approach is based on cycle-consistent mapping functions that transform image embeddings into report embeddings, coupled with report auto-encoding for medical report generation. Our model and objectives consider intricate local details and the overarching semantic context within images and reports. This approach facilitates the learning of effective mapping functions, resulting in the generation of coherent reports. It outperforms state-of-the-art results in unpaired chest X-ray report generation, demonstrating improvements in both language and clinical metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of video-based large language models (LLMs), their adversarial threat remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose the first adversarial attack tailored for video-based LLMs by crafting flow-based multi-modal adversarial perturbations on a small fraction of frames within a video, dubbed FMM-Attack. Extensive experiments show that our attack can effectively induce video-based LLMs to generate incorrect answers when videos are added with imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Intriguingly, our FMM-Attack can also induce garbling in the model output, prompting video-based LLMs to hallucinate. Overall, our observations inspire a further understanding of multi-modal robustness and safety-related feature alignment across different modalities, which is of great importance for various large multi-modal models.

      <title>IDAdapter: Learning Mixed Features for Tuning-Free Personalization of Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging Stable Diffusion for the generation of personalized portraits has emerged as a powerful and noteworthy tool, enabling users to create high-fidelity, custom character avatars based on their specific prompts. However, existing personalization methods face challenges, including test-time fine-tuning, the requirement of multiple input images, low preservation of identity, and limited diversity in generated outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce IDAdapter, a tuning-free approach that enhances the diversity and identity preservation in personalized image generation from a single face image. IDAdapter integrates a personalized concept into the generation process through a combination of textual and visual injections and a face identity loss. During the training phase, we incorporate mixed features from multiple reference images of a specific identity to enrich identity-related content details, guiding the model to generate images with more diverse styles, expressions, and angles compared to previous works. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving both diversity and identity fidelity in generated images.</description>

      <title>Soft-Label Anonymous Gastric X-ray Image Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a soft-label anonymous gastric X-ray image distillation method based on a gradient descent approach. The sharing of medical data is demanded to construct high-accuracy computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. However, the large size of the medical dataset and privacy protection are remaining problems in medical data sharing, which hindered the research of CAD systems. The idea of our distillation method is to extract the valid information of the medical dataset and generate a tiny distilled dataset that has a different data distribution. Different from model distillation, our method aims to find the optimal distilled images, distilled labels and the optimized learning rate. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only effectively compress the medical dataset but also anonymize medical images to protect the patient's private information. The proposed approach can improve the efficiency and security of medical data sharing.</description>

      <title>M3FAS: An Accurate and Robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face presentation attacks (FPA), also known as face spoofing, have brought increasing concerns to the public through various malicious applications, such as financial fraud and privacy leakage. Therefore, safeguarding face recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing learning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding detection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer significant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies seek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when either modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an accurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to overcome the issues above. The primary innovation of this work lies in the following aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and auditory modalities using three commonly available sensors: camera, speaker, and microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three hierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion; (3). We propose a multi-head training strategy, allowing the model to output predictions from the vision, acoustic, and fusion heads, resulting in a more flexible PAD. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the accuracy, robustness, and flexibility of M3FAS under various challenging experimental settings.

      <title>Deep Learning for Inertial Positioning: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inertial sensors are widely utilized in smartphones, drones, robots, and IoT devices, playing a crucial role in enabling ubiquitous and reliable localization. Inertial sensor-based positioning is essential in various applications, including personal navigation, location-based security, and human-device interaction. However, low-cost MEMS inertial sensors' measurements are inevitably corrupted by various error sources, leading to unbounded drifts when integrated doubly in traditional inertial navigation algorithms, subjecting inertial positioning to the problem of error drifts. In recent years, with the rapid increase in sensor data and computational power, deep learning techniques have been developed, sparking significant research into addressing the problem of inertial positioning. Relevant literature in this field spans across mobile computing, robotics, and machine learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of deep learning-based inertial positioning and its applications in tracking pedestrians, drones, vehicles, and robots. We connect efforts from different fields and discuss how deep learning can be applied to address issues such as sensor calibration, positioning error drift reduction, and multi-sensor fusion. This article aims to attract readers from various backgrounds, including researchers and practitioners interested in the potential of deep learning-based techniques to solve inertial positioning problems. Our review demonstrates the exciting possibilities that deep learning brings to the table and provides a roadmap for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Mpox-AISM: AI-Mediated Super Monitoring for Mpox and Like-Mpox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key to preventing the spread of mpox (monkeypox) lies in timely, convenient, and accurate diagnosis for earlier-stage infected individuals. Unfortunately, the resemblances between common skin diseases and mpox and the need for professional diagnosis inevitably deteriorated the diagnosis of earlier-stage patients with Mpox and contributed to its widespread outbreak in crowded areas. Here, we proposed a real-time visualization strategy called "Super Monitoring" using artificial intelligence and Internet technology, thereby performing a low-cost, convenient, timely, and unspecialized diagnosis for earlier-stage mpox. Specifically, such AI-mediated "super monitoring" (Mpox-AISM) invokes a framework assembled by deep learning models, data augmentation, self-supervised learning, and cloud services. Verified by publicly available datasets, the Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1-score of Mpox-AISM in diagnosing mpox achieved 99.3%, 94.1%, 99.9%, and 96.6%, respectively. Furthermore, Mpox-AISM's overall accuracy reaches 94.51% in diagnosing mpox, six like-mpox skin diseases, and normal skin. We also employed gradient-weighted class activation mapping to explain the decision-making process of Mpox-AISM, thus handily understanding the specific characteristics that may indicate the mpox's onset and improving its reliability. With the help of the Internet and communication terminal, Mpox-AISM can perform a real-time, low-cost, and convenient diagnosis for earlier-stage mpox in various real-world settings, thereby effectively curbing the spread of mpox virus.</description>

      <title>RTFS-Net: Recurrent Time-Frequency Modelling for Efficient Audio-Visual Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17189v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation methods aim to integrate different modalities to generate high-quality separated speech, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as speech recognition. Most existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models operate in the time domain. However, their overly simplistic approach to modeling acoustic features often necessitates larger and more computationally intensive models in order to achieve SOTA performance. In this paper, we present a novel time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method: Recurrent Time-Frequency Separation Network (RTFS-Net), which applies its algorithms on the complex time-frequency bins yielded by the Short-Time Fourier Transform. We model and capture the time and frequency dimensions of the audio independently using a multi-layered RNN along each dimension. Furthermore, we introduce a unique attention-based fusion technique for the efficient integration of audio and visual information, and a new mask separation approach that takes advantage of the intrinsic spectral nature of the acoustic features for a clearer separation. RTFS-Net outperforms the prior SOTA method in both inference speed and separation quality while reducing the number of parameters by 90% and MACs by 83%. This is the first time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method to outperform all contemporary time-domain counterparts.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Aware Transformer for Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has gained traction as an effective solution for image storage and transmission in recent years. However, existing LIC methods are redundant in latent representation due to limitations in capturing anisotropic frequency components and preserving directional details. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel frequency-aware transformer (FAT) block that for the first time achieves multiscale directional ananlysis for LIC. The FAT block comprises frequency-decomposition window attention (FDWA) modules to capture multiscale and directional frequency components of natural images. Additionally, we introduce frequency-modulation feed-forward network (FMFFN) to adaptively modulate different frequency components, improving rate-distortion performance. Furthermore, we present a transformer-based channel-wise autoregressive (T-CA) model that effectively exploits channel dependencies. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance compared to existing LIC methods, and evidently outperforms latest standardized codec VTM-12.1 by 14.5%, 15.1%, 13.0% in BD-rate on the Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC datasets.</description>

Abstract: TD-MPC is a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that performs local trajectory optimization in the latent space of a learned implicit (decoder-free) world model. In this work, we present TD-MPC2: a series of improvements upon the TD-MPC algorithm. We demonstrate that TD-MPC2 improves significantly over baselines across 104 online RL tasks spanning 4 diverse task domains, achieving consistently strong results with a single set of hyperparameters. We further show that agent capabilities increase with model and data size, and successfully train a single 317M parameter agent to perform 80 tasks across multiple task domains, embodiments, and action spaces. We conclude with an account of lessons, opportunities, and risks associated with large TD-MPC2 agents. Explore videos, models, data, code, and more at https://tdmpc2.com</description>

      <title>Weighted Ensemble Models Are Strong Continual Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of continual learning (CL) where the goal is to learn a model on a sequence of tasks, such that the data from the previous tasks becomes unavailable while learning on the current task data. CL is essentially a balancing act between being able to learn on the new task (i.e., plasticity) and maintaining the performance on the previously learned concepts (i.e., stability). Intending to address the stability-plasticity trade-off, we propose to perform weight-ensembling of the model parameters of the previous and current tasks. This weighted-ensembled model, which we call Continual Model Averaging (or CoMA), attains high accuracy on the current task by leveraging plasticity, while not deviating too far from the previous weight configuration, ensuring stability. We also propose an improved variant of CoMA, named Continual Fisher-weighted Model Averaging (or CoFiMA), that selectively weighs each parameter in the weights ensemble by leveraging the Fisher information of the weights of the model. Both variants are conceptually simple, easy to implement, and effective in attaining state-of-the-art performance on several standard CL benchmarks.

      <title>Consistency Enhancement-Based Deep Multiview Clustering via Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiview clustering (MVC) segregates data samples into meaningful clusters by synthesizing information across multiple views. Moreover, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated their strong feature learning capabilities in MVC scenarios. However, effectively generalizing feature representations while maintaining consistency is still an intractable problem. In addition, most existing deep clustering methods based on contrastive learning overlook the consistency of the clustering representations during the clustering process. In this paper, we show how the above problems can be overcome and propose a consistent enhancement-based deep MVC method via contrastive learning (CCEC). Specifically, semantic connection blocks are incorporated into a feature representation to preserve the consistent information among multiple views. Furthermore, the representation process for clustering is enhanced through spectral clustering, and the consistency across multiple views is improved. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method in comparison with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The code for this method can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CCEC-E84E/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the anatomy of renal pathology is crucial for advancing disease diagnostics, treatment evaluation, and clinical research. The complex kidney system comprises various components across multiple levels, including regions (cortex, medulla), functional units (glomeruli, tubules), and cells (podocytes, mesangial cells in glomerulus). Prior studies have predominantly overlooked the intricate spatial interrelations among objects from clinical knowledge. In this research, we introduce a novel universal proposition learning approach, called panoramic renal pathology segmentation (PrPSeg), designed to segment comprehensively panoramic structures within kidney by integrating extensive knowledge of kidney anatomy.
  In this paper, we propose (1) the design of a comprehensive universal proposition matrix for renal pathology, facilitating the incorporation of classification and spatial relationships into the segmentation process; (2) a token-based dynamic head single network architecture, with the improvement of the partial label image segmentation and capability for future data enlargement; and (3) an anatomy loss function, quantifying the inter-object relationships across the kidney.</description>

      <title>MedMamba: Vision Mamba for Medical Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image classification is a very fundamental and crucial task in the field of computer vision. These years, CNN-based and Transformer-based models have been widely used to classify various medical images. Unfortunately, The limitation of CNNs in long-range modeling capabilities prevents them from effectively extracting features in medical images, while Transformers are hampered by their quadratic computational complexity. Recent research has shown that the state space model (SSM) represented by Mamba can efficiently model long-range interactions while maintaining linear computational complexity. Inspired by this, we propose Vision Mamba for medical image classification (MedMamba). More specifically, we introduce a novel Conv-SSM module. Conv-SSM combines the local feature extraction ability of convolutional layers with the ability of SSM to capture long-range dependency, thereby modeling medical images with different modalities. To demonstrate the potential of MedMamba, we conducted extensive experiments using 14 publicly available medical datasets with different imaging techniques and two private datasets built by ourselves. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MedMamba performs well in detecting lesions in various medical images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Vision Mamba tailored for medical image classification. The purpose of this work is to establish a new baseline for medical image classification tasks and provide valuable insights for the future development of more efficient and effective SSM-based artificial intelligence algorithms and application systems in the medical.

      <description>arXiv:2403.05594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and discuss the results of a qualitative analysis of visual representations from images. We labeled each image's essential stimuli, the removal of which would render a visualization uninterpretable. As a result, we derive a typology of 10 visualization types of defined groups. We describe the typology derivation process in which we engaged. The resulting typology and image analysis can serve a number of purposes: enabling researchers to study the evolution of the community and its research output over time, facilitating the categorization of visualization images for the purpose of research and teaching, allowing researchers and practitioners to identify visual design styles to further align the quantification of any visual information processor, be that a person or an algorithm observer, and it facilitates a discussion of standardization in visualization. In addition to the visualization typology from images, we provide a dataset of 6,833 tagged images and an online tool that can be used to explore and analyze the large set of labeled images. The tool and data set enable scholars to closely examine the diverse visual designs used and how they are published and communicated in our community.

      <title>A Geospatial Approach to Predicting Desert Locust Breeding Grounds in Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Desert locust swarms present a major threat to agriculture and food security. Addressing this challenge, our study develops an operationally-ready model for predicting locust breeding grounds, which has the potential to enhance early warning systems and targeted control measures. We curated a dataset from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (UN-FAO) locust observation records and analyzed it using two types of spatio-temporal input features: remotely-sensed environmental and climate data as well as multi-spectral earth observation images. Our approach employed custom deep learning models (three-dimensional and LSTM-based recurrent convolutional networks), along with the geospatial foundational model Prithvi recently released by Jakubik et al., 2023. These models notably outperformed existing baselines, with the Prithvi-based model, fine-tuned on multi-spectral images from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset, achieving the highest accuracy, F1 and ROC-AUC scores (83.03%, 81.53% and 87.69%, respectively). A significant finding from our research is that multi-spectral earth observation images alone are sufficient for effective locust breeding ground prediction without the need to explicitly incorporate climatic or environmental features.</description>

      <title>Training Small Multimodal Models to Bridge Biomedical Competency Gap: A Case Study in Radiology Imaging</title>

Abstract: The scaling laws and extraordinary performance of large foundation models motivate the development and utilization of such large models in biomedicine. However, despite early promising results on some biomedical benchmarks, there are still major challenges that need to be addressed before these models can be used in real-world applications. Frontier models such as GPT-4V still have major competency gaps in multimodal capabilities for biomedical applications. Moreover, pragmatic issues such as access, cost, latency, and compliance make it hard for clinicians to use privately-hosted state-of-the-art large models directly on private patient data. In this paper, we explore training open-source small multimodal models (SMMs) to bridge biomedical competency gaps for unmet clinical needs. To maximize data efficiency, we adopt a modular approach by incorporating state-of-the-art pre-trained models for image and text modalities, and focusing on training a lightweight adapter to ground each modality to the text embedding space. We conduct a comprehensive study of this approach on radiology imaging. For training, we assemble a large dataset with over 1 million image-text pairs. For evaluation, we propose a clinically driven novel approach using GPT-4 and demonstrate its parity with expert evaluation. We also study grounding qualitatively using attention. For best practice, we conduct a systematic ablation study on various choices in data engineering and multimodal training. The resulting LLaVA-Rad (7B) model attains state-of-the-art results on radiology tasks such as report generation and cross-modal retrieval, even outperforming much larger models such as GPT-4V and Med-PaLM M (84B). LLaVA-Rad is fast and can be run on a single V100 GPU in private settings, offering a promising state-of-the-art tool for real-world clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Data Value Estimation for Visual Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual instruction tuning is the key to building multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which greatly improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in vision scenario. However, existing MLLMs mostly rely on a mixture of multiple highly diverse visual instruction datasets for training (even more than a million instructions), which may introduce data redundancy. To investigate this issue, we conduct a series of empirical studies, which reveal a significant redundancy within the visual instruction datasets, and show that greatly reducing the amount of several instruction dataset even do not affect the performance. Based on the findings, we propose a new data selection approach TIVE, to eliminate redundancy within visual instruction data. TIVE first estimates the task-level and instance-level value of the visual instructions based on computed gradients. Then, according to the estimated values, TIVE determines the task proportion within the visual instructions, and selects representative instances to compose a smaller visual instruction subset for training. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 show that our approach using only about 7.5% data can achieve comparable performance as the full-data fine-tuned model across seven benchmarks, even surpassing it on four of the benchmarks. Our code and data will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>Generalizing deep learning models for medical image classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous Deep Learning (DL) models have been developed for a large spectrum of medical image analysis applications, which promises to reshape various facets of medical practice. Despite early advances in DL model validation and implementation, which encourage healthcare institutions to adopt them, some fundamental questions remain: are the DL models capable of generalizing? What causes a drop in DL model performances? How to overcome the DL model performance drop? Medical data are dynamic and prone to domain shift, due to multiple factors such as updates to medical equipment, new imaging workflow, and shifts in patient demographics or populations can induce this drift over time. In this paper, we review recent developments in generalization methods for DL-based classification models. We also discuss future challenges, including the need for improved evaluation protocols and benchmarks, and envisioned future developments to achieve robust, generalized models for medical image classification.</description>

      <title>Driving Animatronic Robot Facial Expression From Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animatronic robots aim to enable natural human-robot interaction through lifelike facial expressions. However, generating realistic, speech-synchronized robot expressions is challenging due to the complexities of facial biomechanics and responsive motion synthesis. This paper presents a principled, skinning-centric approach to drive animatronic robot facial expressions from speech. The proposed approach employs linear blend skinning (LBS) as the core representation to guide tightly integrated innovations in embodiment design and motion synthesis. LBS informs the actuation topology, enables human expression retargeting, and allows speech-driven facial motion generation. The proposed approach is capable of generating highly realistic, real-time facial expressions from speech on an animatronic face, significantly advancing robots' ability to replicate nuanced human expressions for natural interaction.</description>
