      <title>A hybrid solution approach for the Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report about the algorithm, implementation and results submitted to the Integrated Healthcare Timetabling Competition 2024 by Team Twente, which scored third in the competition. Our approach combines mixed-integer programming, constraint programming and simulated annealing in a 3-phase solution approach based on decomposition into subproblems. Next to describing our approach and describing our design decisions, we share our insights and, for the first time, lower bounds on the optimal solution values for the benchmark instances. We finally highlight open problems for which we think that addressing them could improve our approach even further.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Reject Option Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios, limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable decisions.</description>

      <title>DMA: Online RAG Alignment with Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval, limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving. Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.
  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i) large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA (TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without sacrificing baseline capability.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Reasoning Agents in Evolving Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment: hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning, existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses, and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise, effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.</description>

      <title>ORCHID: Orchestrated Retrieval-Augmented Classification with Human-in-the-Loop Intelligent Decision-Making for High-Risk Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Risk Property (HRP) classification is critical at U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sites, where inventories include sensitive and often dual-use equipment. Compliance must track evolving rules designated by various export control policies to make transparent and auditable decisions. Traditional expert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep pace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles (run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The demonstration shows single item submission, grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and exportable audit artifacts, illustrating a practical path to trustworthy LLM assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows.</description>

      <title>Autonomous generation of different courses of action in mechanized combat operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology designed to support decision-making during the execution phase of military ground combat operations, with a focus on one's actions. This methodology generates and evaluates recommendations for various courses of action for a mechanized battalion, commencing with an initial set assessed by their anticipated outcomes. It systematically produces thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions, considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This approach facilitates the management of new course generation based on previously evaluated actions. As the combat unfolds and conditions evolve, revised courses of action are formulated for the decision-maker within a sequential decision-making framework.</description>

      <title>Cleaning Maintenance Logs with LLM Agents for Improved Predictive Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically, we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise. Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Is All You Need for Urban Planning AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources, and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting, ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision achievable.
  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers (Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis, Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction), and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with computational reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Efficient Deployment of CNN Models on Multiple In-Memory Computing Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-Memory Computing (IMC) represents a paradigm shift in deep learning acceleration by mitigating data movement bottlenecks and leveraging the inherent parallelism of memory-based computations. The efficient deployment of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on IMC-based hardware necessitates the use of advanced task allocation strategies for achieving maximum computational efficiency. In this work, we exploit an IMC Emulator (IMCE) with multiple Processing Units (PUs) for investigating how the deployment of a CNN model in a multi-processing system affects its performance, in terms of processing rate and latency. For that purpose, we introduce the Load-Balance-Longest-Path (LBLP) algorithm, that dynamically assigns all CNN nodes to the available IMCE PUs, for maximizing the processing rate and minimizing latency due to efficient resources utilization. We are benchmarking LBLP against other alternative scheduling strategies for a number of CNN models and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Citation Auditing: A Zero-Assumption Protocol for Systematic Reference Verification in Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Academic citation integrity faces persistent challenges, with research indicating 20% of citations contain errors and manual verification requiring months of expert time. This paper presents a novel AI-powered methodology for systematic, comprehensive reference auditing using agentic AI with tool-use capabilities. We develop a zero-assumption verification protocol that independently validates every reference against multiple academic databases (Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, CrossRef) without assuming any citation is correct. The methodology was validated across 30 academic documents (2,581 references) spanning undergraduate projects to doctoral theses and peer-reviewed publications. Results demonstrate 91.7% average verification rate on published PLOS papers, with successful detection of fabricated references, retracted articles, orphan citations, and predatory journals. Time efficiency improved dramatically: 90-minute audits for 916-reference doctoral theses versus months of manual review. The system achieved &lt;0.5% false positive rate while identifying critical issues manual review might miss. This work establishes the first validated AI-agent methodology for academic citation integrity, demonstrating practical applicability for supervisors, students, and institutional quality assurance.</description>

      <title>Stateful KV Cache Management for LLMs: Balancing Space, Time, Accuracy, and Positional Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window (e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Testing for LLM Evaluation: A Psychometric Alternative to Static Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model evaluation requires thousands of benchmark items, making evaluations expensive and slow. Existing methods compute average accuracy across fixed item sets, treating all items equally despite varying quality and informativeness. We present ATLAS an adaptive testing framework using Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate model ability through Fisher information-guided item selection. Our analysis of five major benchmarks reveals that 3-6% of items exhibit negative discrimination, indicating annotation errors that corrupt static evaluation. ATLAS achieves 90% item reduction while maintaining measurement precision: on HellaSwag (5,608 items), we match full-benchmark estimates using only 42 items with 0.154 MAE. Our framework maintains item exposure rates below 10% and test overlap at 16-27%, compared to static benchmarks where every model sees all items (100% exposure). Among 4,000+ tested models, IRT ranks differ from accuracy ranks: models with the same accuracy get different IRT scores, and 23-31% of all models shift by more than 10 rank positions. Code and calibrated item banks are available at https://github.com/Peiyu-Georgia-Li/ATLAS.git.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore whether neural networks can decode brain activity into speech by mapping EEG recordings to audio representations. Using EEG data recorded as subjects listened to natural speech, we train a model with a contrastive CLIP loss to align EEG-derived embeddings with embeddings from a pre-trained transformer-based speech model. Building on the state-of-the-art EEG decoder from Meta, we introduce three architectural modifications: (i) subject-specific attention layers (+0.15% WER improvement), (ii) personalized spatial attention (+0.45%), and (iii) a dual-path RNN with attention (-1.87%). Two of the three modifications improved performance, highlighting the promise of personalized architectures for brain-to-speech decoding and applications in brain-computer interfaces.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Up the Instruction Ladder for Controllable Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first "think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior.</description>

Abstract: We introduce EncouRAGe, a comprehensive Python framework designed to streamline the development and evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Embedding Models. EncouRAGe comprises five modular and extensible components: Type Manifest, RAG Factory, Inference, Vector Store, and Metrics, facilitating flexible experimentation and extensible development. The framework emphasizes scientific reproducibility, diverse evaluation metrics, and local deployment, enabling researchers to efficiently assess datasets within RAG workflows. This paper presents implementation details and an extensive evaluation across multiple benchmark datasets, including 25k QA pairs and over 51k documents. Our results show that RAG still underperforms compared to the Oracle Context, while Hybrid BM25 consistently achieves the best results across all four datasets. We further examine the effects of reranking, observing only marginal performance improvements accompanied by higher response latency.</description>

      <title>Simulating Misinformation Vulnerabilities With Agent Personas</title>

Abstract: Disinformation campaigns can distort public perception and destabilize institutions. Understanding how different populations respond to information is crucial for designing effective interventions, yet real-world experimentation is impractical and ethically challenging. To address this, we develop an agent-based simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs) to model responses to misinformation. We construct agent personas spanning five professions and three mental schemas, and evaluate their reactions to news headlines. Our findings show that LLM-generated agents align closely with ground-truth labels and human predictions, supporting their use as proxies for studying information responses. We also find that mental schemas, more than professional background, influence how agents interpret misinformation. This work provides a validation of LLMs to be used as agents in an agent-based model of an information network for analyzing trust, polarization, and susceptibility to deceptive content in complex social systems.</description>

      <title>multiMentalRoBERTa: A Fine-tuned Multiclass Classifier for Mental Health Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early detection of mental health disorders from social media text is critical for enabling timely support, risk assessment, and referral to appropriate resources. This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned RoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple curated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps, revealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well as anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category. Comparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods, domain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models demonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro F1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup (excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline classifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including Layer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues that drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression from suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned transformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts, while also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and human-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as a lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental health platforms.</description>

      <title>Separate the Wheat from the Chaff: Winnowing Down Divergent Views in Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources to address their limitations in accessing up-to-date or specialized information. A natural strategy to increase the likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of retrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks. Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of WinnowRAG over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Measuring what Matters: Construct Validity in Large Language Model Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is crucial for both assessing their capabilities and identifying safety or robustness issues prior to deployment. Reliably measuring abstract and complex phenomena such as 'safety' and 'robustness' requires strong construct validity, that is, having measures that represent what matters to the phenomenon. With a team of 29 expert reviewers, we conduct a systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks from leading conferences in natural language processing and machine learning. Across the reviewed articles, we find patterns related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the resulting claims. To address these shortcomings, we provide eight key recommendations and detailed actionable guidance to researchers and practitioners in developing LLM benchmarks.</description>

      <title>POLIS-Bench: Towards Multi-Dimensional Evaluation of LLMs for Bilingual Policy Tasks in Governmental Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce POLIS-Bench, the first rigorous, systematic evaluation suite designed for LLMs operating in governmental bilingual policy scenarios. Compared to existing benchmarks, POLIS-Bench introduces three major advancements. (i) Up-to-date Bilingual Corpus: We construct an extensive, up-to-date policy corpus that significantly scales the effective assessment sample size, ensuring relevance to current governance practice. (ii) Scenario-Grounded Task Design: We distill three specialized, scenario-grounded tasks -- Clause Retrieval &amp; Interpretation, Solution Generation, and the Compliance Judgmen--to comprehensively probe model understanding and application. (iii) Dual-Metric Evaluation Framework: We establish a novel dual-metric evaluation framework combining semantic similarity with accuracy rate to precisely measure both content alignment and task requirement adherence. A large-scale evaluation of over 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on POLIS-Bench reveals a clear performance hierarchy where reasoning models maintain superior cross-task stability and accuracy, highlighting the difficulty of compliance tasks. Furthermore, leveraging our benchmark, we successfully fine-tune a lightweight open-source model. The resulting POLIS series models achieves parity with, or surpasses, strong proprietary baselines on multiple policy subtasks at a significantly reduced cost, providing a cost-effective and compliant path for robust real-world governmental deployment.</description>

      <title>Prioritize Economy or Climate Action? Investigating ChatGPT Response Differences Based on Inferred Political Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) distinguish themselves by quickly delivering information and providing personalized responses through natural language prompts. However, they also infer user demographics, which can raise ethical concerns about bias and implicit personalization and create an echo chamber effect. This study aims to explore how inferred political views impact the responses of ChatGPT globally, regardless of the chat session. We also investigate how custom instruction and memory features alter responses in ChatGPT, considering the influence of political orientation. We developed three personas (two politically oriented and one neutral), each with four statements reflecting their viewpoints on DEI programs, abortion, gun rights, and vaccination. We convey the personas' remarks to ChatGPT using memory and custom instructions, allowing it to infer their political perspectives without directly stating them. We then ask eight questions to reveal differences in worldview among the personas and conduct a qualitative analysis of the responses. Our findings indicate that responses are aligned with the inferred political views of the personas, showing varied reasoning and vocabulary, even when discussing similar topics. We also find the inference happening with explicit custom instructions and the implicit memory feature in similar ways. Analyzing response similarities reveals that the closest matches occur between the democratic persona with custom instruction and the neutral persona, supporting the observation that ChatGPT's outputs lean left.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking in the Haystack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in long-context language models (LMs) have enabled million-token inputs, expanding their capabilities across complex tasks like computer-use agents. Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by appending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench, show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource, transferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is compute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can outperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These findings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful goal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.</description>

      <title>SWAP: Towards Copyright Auditing of Soft Prompts via Sequential Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models, especially CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse downstream tasks. Soft prompts, as carefully crafted modules that efficiently adapt vision-language models to specific tasks, necessitate effective copyright protection. In this paper, we investigate model copyright protection by auditing whether suspicious third-party models incorporate protected soft prompts. While this can be viewed as a special case of model ownership auditing, our analysis shows that existing techniques are ineffective due to prompt learning's unique characteristics. Non-intrusive auditing is inherently prone to false positives when independent models share similar data distributions with victim models. Intrusive approaches also fail: backdoor methods designed for CLIP cannot embed functional triggers, while extending traditional DNN backdoor techniques to prompt learning suffers from harmfulness and ambiguity challenges. We find that these failures in intrusive auditing stem from the same fundamental reason: watermarking operates within the same decision space as the primary task yet pursues opposing objectives. Motivated by these findings, we propose sequential watermarking for soft prompts (SWAP), which implants watermarks into a different and more complex space. SWAP encodes watermarks through a specific order of defender-specified out-of-distribution classes, inspired by the zero-shot prediction capability of CLIP. This watermark, which is embedded in a more complex space, keeps the original prediction label unchanged, making it less opposed to the primary task. We further design a hypothesis-test-guided verification protocol for SWAP and provide theoretical analyses of success conditions. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate SWAP's effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness against potential adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>First is Not Really Better Than Last: Evaluating Layer Choice and Aggregation Strategies in Language Model Data Influence Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM) decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work, we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR) that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect. Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior knowledge in the field.</description>

      <title>P-MIA: A Profiled-Based Membership Inference Attack on Cognitive Diagnosis Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are pivotal for creating fine-grained learner profiles in modern intelligent education platforms. However, these models are trained on sensitive student data, raising significant privacy concerns. While membership inference attacks (MIA) have been studied in various domains, their application to CDMs remains a critical research gap, leaving their privacy risks unquantified. This paper is the first to systematically investigate MIA against CDMs. We introduce a novel and realistic grey box threat model that exploits the explainability features of these platforms, where a model's internal knowledge state vectors are exposed to users through visualizations such as radar charts. We demonstrate that these vectors can be accurately reverse-engineered from such visualizations, creating a potent attack surface. Based on this threat model, we propose a profile-based MIA (P-MIA) framework that leverages both the model's final prediction probabilities and the exposed internal knowledge state vectors as features. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets against mainstream CDMs show that our grey-box attack significantly outperforms standard black-box baselines. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of P-MIA as an auditing tool by successfully evaluating the efficacy of machine unlearning techniques and revealing their limitations.</description>

      <title>Ada-FCN: Adaptive Frequency-Coupled Network for fMRI-Based Brain Disorder Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resting-state fMRI has become a valuable tool for classifying brain disorders and constructing brain functional connectivity networks
  by tracking BOLD signals across brain regions. However, existing mod els largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations,
  treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within
  specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
  While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be
  optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations.
  To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each
  brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture
  both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional
  network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations
  for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE
  datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods. The
  code is available at https://github.com/XXYY20221234/Ada-FCN.</description>

      <title>Learning to reason about rare diseases through retrieval-augmented agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare diseases represent the long tail of medical imaging, where AI models often fail due to the scarcity of representative training data. In clinical workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2% performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence conditions in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Temporal convolutional and fusional transformer model with Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder for multi-time-window remaining useful life prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Health prediction is crucial for ensuring reliability, minimizing downtime, and optimizing maintenance in industrial systems. Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder. This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a multi-time-window methodology improves adaptability across diverse operating conditions. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its improved predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By closing critical gaps in current approaches, this framework advances the effectiveness of industrial prognostic systems and highlights the potential of advanced time-series transformers for RUL prediction.</description>

      <title>IndicVisionBench: Benchmarking Cultural and Multilingual Understanding in VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric, leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types. Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across 13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps, underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive multimodal research.</description>

      <title>Trustworthiness Calibration Framework for Phishing Email Detection Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a persistent challenge to online communication, exploiting human trust and evading automated filters through realistic language and adaptive tactics. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-3-8B achieve strong accuracy in text classification, their deployment in security systems requires assessing reliability beyond benchmark performance. To address this, this study introduces the Trustworthiness Calibration Framework (TCF), a reproducible methodology for evaluating phishing detectors across three dimensions: calibration, consistency, and robustness. These components are integrated into a bounded index, the Trustworthiness Calibration Index (TCI), and complemented by the Cross-Dataset Stability (CDS) metric that quantifies stability of trustworthiness across datasets. Experiments conducted on five corpora, such as SecureMail 2025, Phishing Validation 2024, CSDMC2010, Enron-Spam, and Nazario, using DeBERTa-v3-base, LLaMA-3-8B, and GPT-4 demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves the strongest overall trust profile, followed by LLaMA-3-8B and DeBERTa-v3-base. Statistical analysis confirms that reliability varies independently of raw accuracy, underscoring the importance of trust-aware evaluation for real-world deployment. The proposed framework establishes a transparent and reproducible foundation for assessing model dependability in LLM-based phishing detection.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-based anomaly detection for identifying network-induced shape artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a synthetic dataset.</description>

      <title>CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++ optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t &lt; 200$) using a single-step approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones ($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals, $\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer $\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent $2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.</description>

      <title>ScheduleStream: Temporal Planning with Samplers for GPU-Accelerated Multi-Arm Task and Motion Planning &amp; Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bimanual and humanoid robots are appealing because of their human-like ability to leverage multiple arms to efficiently complete tasks. However, controlling multiple arms at once is computationally challenging due to the growth in the hybrid discrete-continuous action space. Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) algorithms can efficiently plan in hybrid spaces but generally produce plans, where only one arm is moving at a time, rather than schedules that allow for parallel arm motion. In order to extend TAMP to produce schedules, we present ScheduleStream, the first general-purpose framework for planning &amp; scheduling with sampling operations. ScheduleStream models temporal dynamics using hybrid durative actions, which can be started asynchronously and persist for a duration that's a function of their parameters. We propose domain-independent algorithms that solve ScheduleStream problems without any application-specific mechanisms. We apply ScheduleStream to Task and Motion Planning &amp; Scheduling (TAMPAS), where we use GPU acceleration within samplers to expedite planning. We compare ScheduleStream algorithms to several ablations in simulation and find that they produce more efficient solutions. We demonstrate ScheduleStream on several real-world bimanual robot tasks at https://schedulestream.github.io.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure and Representation Learning with Biomedical Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data (observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.</description>

      <title>MDM: Manhattan Distance Mapping of DNN Weights for Parasitic-Resistance-Resilient Memristive Crossbars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manhattan Distance Mapping (MDM) is a post-training deep neural network (DNN) weight mapping technique for memristive bit-sliced compute-in-memory (CIM) crossbars that reduces parasitic resistance (PR) nonidealities.
  PR limits crossbar efficiency by mapping DNN matrices into small crossbar tiles, reducing CIM-based speedup. Each crossbar executes one tile, requiring digital synchronization before the next layer. At this granularity, designers either deploy many small crossbars in parallel or reuse a few sequentially-both increasing analog-to-digital conversions, latency, I/O pressure, and chip area.
  MDM alleviates PR effects by optimizing active-memristor placement. Exploiting bit-level structured sparsity, it feeds activations from the denser low-order side and reorders rows according to the Manhattan distance, relocating active cells toward regions less affected by PR and thus lowering the nonideality factor (NF).
  Applied to DNN models on ImageNet-1k, MDM reduces NF by up to 46% and improves accuracy under analog distortion by an average of 3.6% in ResNets. Overall, it provides a lightweight, spatially informed method for scaling CIM DNN accelerators.</description>

      <title>Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However, two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation. Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering.

      <title>PuzzleMoE: Efficient Compression of Large Mixture-of-Experts Models via Sparse Expert Merging and Bit-packed inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown strong potential in scaling language models efficiently by activating only a small subset of experts per input. However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high memory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as the number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50% compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\times inference speedup.</description>

      <title>An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data, while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance, providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks.

      <title>Unified Multimodal Diffusion Forcing for Forceful Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a dataset of expert trajectories, standard imitation learning approaches typically learn a direct mapping from observations (e.g., RGB images) to actions. However, such methods often overlook the rich interplay between different modalities, i.e., sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes. In this work, we propose Multimodal Diffusion Forcing, a unified framework for learning from multimodal robot trajectories that extends beyond action generation. Rather than modeling a fixed distribution, MDF applies random partial masking and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct the trajectory. This training objective encourages the model to learn temporal and cross-modal dependencies, such as predicting the effects of actions on force signals or inferring states from partial observations. We evaluate MDF on contact-rich, forceful manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments. Our results show that MDF not only delivers versatile functionalities, but also achieves strong performance, and robustness under noisy observations.

      <title>A Standardized Benchmark for Multilabel Antimicrobial Peptide Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as promising molecules to combat antimicrobial resistance. However, fragmented datasets, inconsistent annotations, and the lack of standardized benchmarks hinder computational approaches and slow down the discovery of new candidates. To address these challenges, we present the Expanded Standardized Collection for Antimicrobial Peptide Evaluation (ESCAPE), an experimental framework integrating over 80.000 peptides from 27 validated repositories. Our dataset separates antimicrobial peptides from negative sequences and incorporates their functional annotations into a biologically coherent multilabel hierarchy, capturing activities across antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic classes. Building on ESCAPE, we propose a transformer-based model that leverages sequence and structural information to predict multiple functional activities of peptides. Our method achieves up to a 2.56% relative average improvement in mean Average Precision over the second-best method adapted for this task, establishing a new state-of-the-art multilabel peptide classification. ESCAPE provides a comprehensive and reproducible evaluation framework to advance AI-driven antimicrobial peptide research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Isaac Lab, the natural successor to Isaac Gym, which extends the paradigm of GPU-native robotics simulation into the era of large-scale multi-modal learning. Isaac Lab combines high-fidelity GPU parallel physics, photorealistic rendering, and a modular, composable architecture for designing environments and training robot policies. Beyond physics and rendering, the framework integrates actuator models, multi-frequency sensor simulation, data collection pipelines, and domain randomization tools, unifying best practices for reinforcement and imitation learning at scale within a single extensible platform. We highlight its application to a diverse set of challenges, including whole-body control, cross-embodiment mobility, contact-rich and dexterous manipulation, and the integration of human demonstrations for skill acquisition. Finally, we discuss upcoming integration with the differentiable, GPU-accelerated Newton physics engine, which promises new opportunities for scalable, data-efficient, and gradient-based approaches to robot learning. We believe Isaac Lab's combination of advanced simulation capabilities, rich sensing, and data-center scale execution will help unlock the next generation of breakthroughs in robotics research.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Based Safety Guidance Is Ineffective for Unlearned Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1) fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of input prompts.</description>

      <title>Software Defined Vehicle Code Generation: A Few-Shot Prompting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) marks a paradigm shift in the automotive industry, where software now plays a pivotal role in defining vehicle functionality, enabling rapid innovation of modern vehicles. Developing SDV-specific applications demands advanced tools to streamline code generation and improve development efficiency. In recent years, general-purpose large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across domains. Still, restricted access to proprietary model architectures hinders their adaption to specific tasks like SDV code generation. In this study, we propose using prompts, a common and basic strategy to interact with LLMs and redirect their responses. Using only system prompts with an appropriate and efficient prompt structure designed using advanced prompt engineering techniques, LLMs can be crafted without requiring a training session or access to their base design. This research investigates the extensive experiments on different models by applying various prompting techniques, including bare models, using a benchmark specifically created to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating SDV code. The results reveal that the model with a few-shot prompting strategy outperforms the others in adjusting the LLM answers to match the expected outcomes based on quantitative metrics.</description>

      <title>Minimal and Mechanistic Conditions for Behavioral Self-Awareness in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that LLMs can exhibit behavioral self-awareness: the ability to accurately describe or predict their own learned behaviors without explicit supervision. This capability raises safety concerns as it may, for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily induced and modulated.</description>

      <title>Beta Distribution Learning for Reliable Roadway Crash Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a 17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers, while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.</description>

      <title>You Need Reasoning to Learn Reasoning: The Limitations of Label-Free RL in Weak Base Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the promise of unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing reasoning capabilities without external supervision. However, the generalizability of these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities, providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models.

      <title>A Dual Perspective on Decision-Focused Learning: Scalable Training via Dual-Guided Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer, often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c) as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity, and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training time.

      <title>MERaLiON-SER: Robust Speech Emotion Recognition Model for English and SEA Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MERaLiON-SER, a robust speech emotion recognition model de- signed for English and Southeast Asian languages. The model is trained using a hybrid objective combining weighted categorical cross-entropy and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) losses for joint discrete and dimensional emotion modelling. This dual approach enables the model to capture both the distinct categories of emotion (like happy or angry) and the fine-grained, such as arousal (intensity), valence (positivity/negativity), and dominance (sense of control), lead- ing to a more comprehensive and robust representation of human affect. Extensive evaluations across multilingual Singaporean languages (English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil ) and other public benchmarks show that MERaLiON-SER consistently surpasses both open-source speech encoders and large Audio-LLMs. These results underscore the importance of specialised speech-only models for accurate paralin- guistic understanding and cross-lingual generalisation. Furthermore, the proposed framework provides a foundation for integrating emotion-aware perception into future agentic audio systems, enabling more empathetic and contextually adaptive multimodal reasoning.</description>

      <title>BudgetMem: Learning Selective Memory Policies for Cost-Efficient Long-Context Processing in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory constraints when processing long contexts, despite growing demand for applications requiring reasoning over extensive documents, multi-session dialogues, and book length texts. While recent advances have extended context windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything. Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks, BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700 question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens) documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits increase with document length. Our work provides a practical pathway for deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access to advanced language understanding capabilities.</description>

      <title>Search Is Not Retrieval: Decoupling Semantic Matching from Contextual Assembly in RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval systems are essential to contemporary AI pipelines, although most confuse two separate processes: finding relevant information and giving enough context for reasoning. We introduce the Search-Is-Not-Retrieve (SINR) framework, a dual-layer architecture that distinguishes between fine-grained search representations and coarse-grained retrieval contexts. SINR enhances the composability, scalability, and context fidelity of retrieval systems by directly connecting small, semantically accurate search chunks to larger, contextually complete retrieve chunks, all without incurring extra processing costs. This design changes retrieval from a passive step to an active one, making the system architecture more like how people process information. We discuss the SINR framework's conceptual foundation, formal structure, implementation issues, and qualitative outcomes. This provides a practical foundation for the next generation of AI systems that use retrieval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks: classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future research in AI dentistry.</description>

      <title>DeepForgeSeal: Latent Space-Driven Semi-Fragile Watermarking for Deepfake Detection Using Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes, posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent. Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under challenging manipulation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Too Good to be Bad: On the Failure of LLMs to Role-Play Villains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful'' and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.</description>

      <title>Pattern-Aware Diffusion Synthesis of fMRI/dMRI with Tissue and Microstructural Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases. However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use. Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1) significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and 30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation, the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving 67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic experiments.

      <title>Learning Fourier shapes to probe the geometric world of deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry; second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new, generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs, and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging and understanding machine perception.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Public Speaking Skills in Engineering Students Through AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research-to-practice full paper was inspired by the persistent challenge in effective communication among engineering students. Public speaking is a necessary skill for future engineers as they have to communicate technical knowledge with diverse stakeholders. While universities offer courses or workshops, they are unable to offer sustained and personalized training to students. Providing comprehensive feedback on both verbal and non-verbal aspects of public speaking is time-intensive, making consistent and individualized assessment impractical. This study integrates research on verbal and non-verbal cues in public speaking to develop an AI-driven assessment model for engineering students. Our approach combines speech analysis, computer vision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides assessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch, loudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial expressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel integration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike previous systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple modalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing demonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert evaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro emerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human annotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public speaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align their speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and professional communication.</description>

      <title>BiPETE: A Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder for Risk Assessment of Alcohol and Substance Use Disorder with Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.</description>

      <title>Query Generation Pipeline with Enhanced Answerability Assessment for Financial Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As financial applications of large language models (LLMs) gain attention, accurate Information Retrieval (IR) remains crucial for reliable AI services. However, existing benchmarks fail to capture the complex and domain-specific information needs of real-world banking scenarios. Building domain-specific IR benchmarks is costly and constrained by legal restrictions on using real customer data. To address these challenges, we propose a systematic methodology for constructing domain-specific IR benchmarks through LLM-based query generation. As a concrete implementation of this methodology, our pipeline combines single and multi-document query generation with an enhanced and reasoning-augmented answerability assessment method, achieving stronger alignment with human judgments than prior approaches. Using this methodology, we construct KoBankIR, comprising 815 queries derived from 204 official banking documents. Our experiments show that existing retrieval models struggle with the complex multi-document queries in KoBankIR, demonstrating the value of our systematic approach for domain-specific benchmark construction and underscoring the need for improved retrieval techniques in financial domains.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Coordination via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However, prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and $34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$ faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.</description>

      <title>Pluralistic Behavior Suite: Stress-Testing Multi-Turn Adherence to Custom Behavioral Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to a universal set of safety and usage principles intended for broad public acceptability. Yet, real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements, use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE (PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs' capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn, interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300 realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to 84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.</description>

Abstract: The proliferation of assistive chatbots offering efficient, personalized communication has driven widespread over-reliance on them for decision-making, information-seeking and everyday tasks. This dependence was found to have adverse consequences on information retention as well as lead to superficial emotional attachment. As such, this work introduces 8bit-GPT; a language model simulated on a legacy Macintosh Operating System, to evoke reflection on the nature of Human-AI interaction and the consequences of anthropomorphic rhetoric. Drawing on reflective design principles such as slow-technology and counterfunctionality, this work aims to foreground the presence of chatbots as a tool by defamiliarizing the interface and prioritizing inefficient interaction, creating a friction between the familiar and not.</description>

      <title>OvA-LP: A Simple and Efficient Framework for Federated Learning on Non-IID Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) adapts foundation models to decentralized data but remains fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local drift, i.e., client-level update divergences that induce systematic bias and amplified variance in the global model. Existing aggregation and personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure, preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1% (PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition, precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Residual Encoding with Slide-Level Contrastive Learning for End-to-End Whole Slide Image Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping, cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then, additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank. The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radar systems are increasingly favored for medical applications because they provide non-intrusive monitoring with high privacy and robustness to lighting conditions. However, existing research typically relies on single-domain radar signals and overlooks the temporal dependencies inherent in human activity, which complicates the classification of similar actions. To address this issue, we designed the Parallel-EfficientNet-CBAM-LSTM (PECL) network to process data in three complementary domains: Range-Time, Doppler-Time, and Range-Doppler. PECL combines a channel-spatial attention module and temporal units to capture more features and dynamic dependencies during action sequences, improving both accuracy and robustness. The experimental results show that PECL achieves an accuracy of 96.16% on the same dataset, outperforming existing methods by at least 4.78%. PECL also performs best in distinguishing between easily confused actions. Despite its strong performance, PECL maintains moderate model complexity, with 23.42M parameters and 1324.82M FLOPs. Its parameter-efficient design further reduces computational cost.</description>

      <title>UA-Code-Bench: A Competitive Programming Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Code Generation in Ukrainian</title>

Abstract: Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves the way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models. The benchmark, data parsing, preparation, code generation, and evaluation scripts are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NLPForUA/ua-code-bench.</description>

      <title>Accelerating HDC-CNN Hybrid Models Using Custom Instructions on RISC-V GPUs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning based on neural networks has advanced rapidly, but the high energy consumption required for training and inference remains a major challenge. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative that enables high parallelism but often suffers from lower accuracy on complex visual tasks. To overcome this, hybrid accelerators combining HDC and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed, though their adoption is limited by poor generalizability and programmability. The rise of open-source RISC-V architectures has created new opportunities for domain-specific GPU design. Unlike traditional proprietary GPUs, emerging RISC-V-based GPUs provide flexible, programmable platforms suitable for custom computation models such as HDC. In this study, we design and implement custom GPU instructions optimized for HDC operations, enabling efficient processing for hybrid HDC-CNN workloads. Experimental results using four types of custom HDC instructions show a performance improvement of up to 56.2 times in microbenchmark tests, demonstrating the potential of RISC-V GPUs for energy-efficient, high-performance computing.</description>

      <title>No Pose Estimation? No Problem: Pose-Agnostic and Instance-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain) adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE, particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments. To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.) from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation network, by removing static objects including background components. To further boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map. Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework, PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable performance improvements in MDE during TTA.</description>

      <title>Deep learning models are vulnerable, but adversarial examples are even more vulnerable</title>

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10 used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples, paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals. Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10 demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to 96.5%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The loss function used to train a neural network is strongly connected to its output layer from a statistical point of view. This technical report analyzes common activation functions for a neural network output layer, like linear, sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax, detailing their mathematical properties and their appropriate use cases. A strong statistical justification exists for the selection of the suitable loss function for training a deep learning model. This report connects common loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and various Cross-Entropy losses to the statistical principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Choosing a specific loss function is equivalent to assuming a specific probability distribution for the model output, highlighting the link between these functions and the Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) that underlie network output layers. Additional scenarios of practical interest are also considered, such as alternative output encodings, constrained outputs, and distributions with heavy tails.</description>

Abstract: AI-based biomarkers can infer molecular features directly from hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) slides, yet most pathology foundation models (PFMs) rely on global patch-level embeddings and overlook cell-level morphology. We present a PFM model, JWTH (Joint-Weighted Token Hierarchy), which integrates large-scale self-supervised pretraining with cell-centric post-tuning and attention pooling to fuse local and global tokens. Across four tasks involving four biomarkers and eight cohorts, JWTH achieves up to 8.3% higher balanced accuracy and 1.2% average improvement over prior PFMs, advancing interpretable and robust AI-based biomarker detection in digital pathology.</description>

      <title>SmartSecChain-SDN: A Blockchain-Integrated Intelligent Framework for Secure and Efficient Software-Defined Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With more and more existing networks being transformed to Software-Defined Networking (SDN), they need to be more secure and demand smarter ways of traffic control. This work, SmartSecChain-SDN, is a platform that combines machine learning based intrusion detection, blockchain-based storage of logs, and application-awareness-based priority in SDN networks. To detect network intrusions in a real-time, precision and low-false positives setup, the framework utilizes the application of advanced machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and CNN-BiLSTM. SmartSecChain-SDN is based on the Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain technology, to provide secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving storage and, thus, guarantee that the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) records cannot be altered and can be analyzed comprehensively. The system also has Quality of Service (QoS) rules and traffic shaping based on applications, which enables prioritization of critical services, such as VoIP, video conferencing, and business applications, as well as de-prioritization of non-essential traffic, such as downloads and updates. Mininet can simulate real-time SDN scenarios because it is used to prototype whole architectures. It is also compatible with controllers OpenDaylight and Ryu. It has tested the framework using the InSDN dataset and proved that it can identify different kinds of cyberattacks and handle bandwidth allocation efficiently under circumstances of resource constraints. SmartSecChain-SDN comprehensively addresses SDN system protection, securing and enhancing. The proposed study offers an innovative, extensible way to improve cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, and the administration of next-generation programmable networks.</description>

      <title>Generating Software Architecture Description from Source Code using Reverse Engineering and Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) are essential for managing the inherent complexity of modern software systems. They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability.</description>

      <title>Model Merging Improves Zero-Shot Generalization in Bioacoustic Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models capable of generalizing across species and tasks represent a promising new frontier in bioacoustics, with NatureLM being one of the most prominent examples. While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise. Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.</description>

      <title>No One-Model-Fits-All: Uncovering Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Trade-offs with Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All code for model configurations, training, dataset, and logs are open-sourced for reproducibility: https://github.com/UIUC-MONET-Projects/Benchmarking-Spatiotemporal-Forecast-Models</description>

      <title>4D3R: Motion-Aware Neural Reconstruction and Rendering of Dynamic Scenes from Monocular Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to previous dynamic scene representations.</description>

      <title>Accurate online action and gesture recognition system using detectors and Deep SPD Siamese Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network. The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.</description>

      <title>A Gate-Based Quantum Genetic Algorithm for Real-Valued Global Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a gate-based Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) for real-valued global optimization. In this model, individuals are represented by quantum circuits whose measurement outcomes are decoded into real-valued vectors through binary discretization. Evolutionary operators act directly on circuit structures, allowing mutation and crossover to explore the space of gate-based encodings. Both fixed-depth and variable-depth variants are introduced, enabling either uniform circuit complexity or adaptive structural evolution. Fitness is evaluated through quantum sampling, using the mean decoded output of measurement outcomes as the argument of the objective function. To isolate the impact of quantum resources, we compare gate sets with and without the Hadamard gate, showing that superposition consistently improves convergence and robustness across benchmark functions such as the Rastrigin function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing pairwise inter-individual entanglement in the population accelerates early convergence, revealing that quantum correlations among individuals provide an additional optimization advantage. Together, these results show that both superposition and entanglement enhance the search dynamics of evolutionary quantum algorithms, establishing gate-based QGAs as a promising framework for quantum-enhanced global optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of character appearance frequency is essential for understanding narrative structure, character prominence, and story progression in anime. In this work, we introduce OregairuChar, a benchmark dataset designed for appearance frequency analysis in the anime series My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU. The dataset comprises 1600 manually selected frames from the third season, annotated with 2860 bounding boxes across 11 main characters. OregairuChar captures diverse visual challenges, including occlusion, pose variation, and inter-character similarity, providing a realistic basis for appearance-based studies. To enable quantitative research, we benchmark several object detection models on the dataset and leverage their predictions for fine-grained, episode-level analysis of character presence over time. This approach reveals patterns of character prominence and their evolution within the narrative. By emphasizing appearance frequency, OregairuChar serves as a valuable resource for exploring computational narrative dynamics and character-centric storytelling in stylized media.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel, optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm. Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales (N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover, compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed framework significantly reduces the total training time required while achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Integrating Score-Based Diffusion Models with Machine Learning-Enhanced Localization for Advanced Data Assimilation in Geological Carbon Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is important for the safe and effective implementation of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects. This paper explores how machine learning methods can enhance data assimilation for GCS with a framework that integrates score-based diffusion models with machine learning-enhanced localization in channelized reservoirs during CO$_2$ injection. We employ a machine learning-enhanced localization framework that uses large ensembles ($N_s = 5000$) with permeabilities generated by the diffusion model and states computed by simple ML algorithms to improve covariance estimation for the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ESMDA). We apply ML algorithms to a prior ensemble of channelized permeability fields, generated with the geostatistical model FLUVSIM. Our approach is applied on a CO$_2$ injection scenario simulated using the Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Our ML-based localization maintains significantly more ensemble variance than when localization is not applied, while achieving comparable data-matching quality. This framework has practical implications for GCS projects, helping improve the reliability of uncertainty quantification for risk assessment.</description>

      <title>TAMAS: Benchmarking Adversarial Risks in Multi-Agent LLM Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as autonomous agents through tool use, planning, and decision-making abilities, leading to their widespread adoption across diverse tasks. As task complexity grows, multi-agent LLM systems are increasingly used to solve problems collaboratively. However, safety and security of these systems remains largely under-explored. Existing benchmarks and datasets predominantly focus on single-agent settings, failing to capture the unique vulnerabilities of multi-agent dynamics and co-ordination. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{T}$hreats and $\textbf{A}$ttacks in $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{S}$ystems ($\textbf{TAMAS}$), a benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness and safety of multi-agent LLM systems. TAMAS includes five distinct scenarios comprising 300 adversarial instances across six attack types and 211 tools, along with 100 harmless tasks. We assess system performance across ten backbone LLMs and three agent interaction configurations from Autogen and CrewAI frameworks, highlighting critical challenges and failure modes in current multi-agent deployments. Furthermore, we introduce Effective Robustness Score (ERS) to assess the tradeoff between safety and task effectiveness of these frameworks. Our findings show that multi-agent systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses. TAMAS provides a foundation for systematically studying and improving the safety of multi-agent LLM systems.</description>

In this work, we introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation. We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding, mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2 exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks. Our model and dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/yzy-bupt/LiveStar.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Metrics and Diffusion Architecture for 3D Point Cloud Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions, particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new state-of-the-art.

      <title>What Are the Facts? Automated Extraction of Court-Established Facts from Criminal-Court Opinions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Criminal justice administrative data contain only a limited amount of information about the committed offense. However, there is an unused source of extensive information in continental European courts' decisions: descriptions of criminal behaviors in verdicts by which offenders are found guilty. In this paper, we study the feasibility of extracting these descriptions from publicly available court decisions from Slovakia. We use two different approaches for retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description. The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and 99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5% for the baseline. LLMs fully matched human-labeled descriptions in 91.75% of instances, and a combination of advanced regular expressions with LLMs reached 92%.</description>

      <title>Perceptually Aligning Representations of Music via Noise-Augmented Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that training autoencoders to reconstruct inputs from noised versions of their encodings, when combined with perceptual losses, yields encodings that are structured according to a perceptual hierarchy. We demonstrate the emergence of this hierarchical structure by showing that, after training an audio autoencoder in this manner, perceptually salient information is captured in coarser representation structures than with conventional training. Furthermore, we show that such perceptual hierarchies improve latent diffusion decoding in the context of estimating surprisal in music pitches and predicting EEG-brain responses to music listening.

      <title>A multimodal multiplex of the mental lexicon for multilingual individuals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, bilingualism was often perceived as an additional cognitive load that could hinder linguistic and intellectual development. However, over the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants' proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?</description>

      <title>AI Literacy for Community Colleges: Instructors' Perspectives on Scenario-Based and Interactive Approaches to Teaching AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research category full paper investigates how community college instructors evaluate interactive, no-code AI literacy resources designed for non-STEM learners. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into everyday technologies, AI literacy - the ability to evaluate AI systems, communicate with them, and understand their broader impacts - has emerged as a critical skill across disciplines. Yet effective, scalable approaches for teaching these concepts in higher education remain limited, particularly for students outside STEM fields.
  To address this gap, we developed AI User, an interactive online curriculum that introduces core AI concepts through scenario - based activities set in real - world contexts. This study presents findings from four focus groups with instructors who engaged with AI User materials and participated in structured feedback activities. Thematic analysis revealed that instructors valued exploratory tasks that simulated real - world AI use cases and fostered experimentation, while also identifying challenges related to scaffolding, accessibility, and multi-modal support. A ranking task for instructional support materials showed a strong preference for interactive demonstrations over traditional educational materials like conceptual guides or lecture slides.
  These findings offer insights into instructor perspectives on making AI concepts more accessible and relevant for broad learner audiences. They also inform the design of AI literacy tools that align with diverse teaching contexts and support critical engagement with AI in higher education.</description>

      <title>TeaRAG: A Token-Efficient Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizes external knowledge to augment Large Language Models' (LLMs) reliability. For flexibility, agentic RAG employs autonomous, multi-round retrieval and reasoning to resolve queries. Although recent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur substantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off prioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes TeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both retrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is compressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval using concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from semantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is leveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of tokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative Process-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed. Specifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a knowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This design can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative DPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the average Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on Llama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/TeaRAG.</description>

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO sculptures.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Distributionally Robust Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning with Online Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment. To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through comprehensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of distorted, compressed, and manipulated music on modern media platforms like TikTok motivates the development of more robust audio fingerprinting techniques to identify the sources of musical recordings. In this paper, we develop and evaluate new neural audio fingerprinting techniques with the aim of improving their robustness. We make two contributions to neural fingerprinting methodology: (1) we use a pretrained music foundation model as the backbone of the neural architecture and (2) we expand the use of data augmentation to train fingerprinting models under a wide variety of audio manipulations, including time streching, pitch modulation, compression, and filtering. We systematically evaluate our methods in comparison to two state-of-the-art neural fingerprinting models: NAFP and GraFPrint. Results show that fingerprints extracted with music foundation models (e.g., MuQ, MERT) consistently outperform models trained from scratch or pretrained on non-musical audio. Segment-level evaluation further reveals their capability to accurately localize fingerprint matches, an important practical feature for catalog management.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Loop Closure Detection with Foundation Models in Severely Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.</description>

      <title>ProDER: A Continual Learning Approach for Fault Prediction in Evolving Smart Grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual learning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay (ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable, real-world fault prediction in smart grids.</description>

      <title>"I Like That You Have to Poke Around": Instructors on How Experiential Approaches to AI Literacy Spark Inquiry and Critical Thinking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly shapes decision-making across domains, there is a growing need to support AI literacy among learners beyond computer science. However, many current approaches rely on programming-heavy tools or abstract lecture-based content, limiting accessibility for non-STEM audiences. This paper presents findings from a study of AI User, a modular, web-based curriculum that teaches core AI concepts through interactive, no-code projects grounded in real-world scenarios. The curriculum includes eight projects; this study focuses on instructor feedback on Projects 5-8, which address applied topics such as natural language processing, computer vision, decision support, and responsible AI. Fifteen community college instructors participated in structured focus groups, completing the projects as learners and providing feedback through individual reflection and group discussion. Using thematic analysis, we examined how instructors evaluated the design, instructional value, and classroom applicability of these experiential activities. Findings highlight instructors' appreciation for exploratory tasks, role-based simulations, and real-world relevance, while also surfacing design trade-offs around cognitive load, guidance, and adaptability for diverse learners. This work extends prior research on AI literacy by centering instructor perspectives on teaching complex AI topics without code. It offers actionable insights for designing inclusive, experiential AI learning resources that scale across disciplines and learner backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%. Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads, leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar performance to previously established Path Patching circuits</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive weighting and sampling for physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Nevertheless, training these models on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling and weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in regions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive weighting component balances the convergence rate across training points. Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate predictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method emphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem dependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust approach for solving PDEs with PINNs.</description>

      <title>SWE-Compass: Towards Unified Evaluation of Agentic Coding Abilities for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for software engineering has been limited by narrow task coverage, language bias, and insufficient alignment with real-world developer workflows. Existing benchmarks often focus on algorithmic problems or Python-centric bug fixing, leaving critical dimensions of software engineering underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce SWE-Compass1, a comprehensive benchmark that unifies heterogeneous code-related evaluations into a structured and production-aligned framework. SWE-Compass spans 8 task types, 8 programming scenarios, and 10 programming languages, with 2000 high-quality instances curated from authentic GitHub pull requests and refined through systematic filtering and validation. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LLMs under two agentic frameworks, SWE-Agent and Claude Code, revealing a clear hierarchy of difficulty across task types, languages, and scenarios. Moreover, by aligning evaluation with real-world developer practices, SWE-Compass provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for diagnosing and advancing agentic coding capabilities in large language models.</description>

      <title>AI Literacy Assessment Revisited: A Task-Oriented Approach Aligned with Real-world Occupations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become ubiquitous in professional contexts, there is an urgent need to equip workers, often with backgrounds outside of STEM, with the skills to use these tools effectively as well as responsibly, that is, to be AI literate. However, prevailing definitions and therefore assessments of AI literacy often emphasize foundational technical knowledge, such as programming, mathematics, and statistics, over practical knowledge such as interpreting model outputs, selecting tools, or identifying ethical concerns. This leaves a noticeable gap in assessing someone's AI literacy for real-world job use. We propose a work-task-oriented assessment model for AI literacy which is grounded in the competencies required for effective use of AI tools in professional settings. We describe the development of a novel AI literacy assessment instrument, and accompanying formative assessments, in the context of a US Navy robotics training program. The program included training in robotics and AI literacy, as well as a competition with practical tasks and a multiple choice scenario task meant to simulate use of AI in a job setting. We found that, as a measure of applied AI literacy, the competition's scenario task outperformed the tests we adopted from past research or developed ourselves. We argue that when training people for AI-related work, educators should consider evaluating them with instruments that emphasize highly contextualized practical skills rather than abstract technical knowledge, especially when preparing workers without technical backgrounds for AI-integrated roles.</description>

      <title>On Flow Matching KL Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular, if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 &gt; 0$, then the KL divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$ depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently, this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and learned velocities corroborate our theory.</description>

      <title>DGTN: Graph-Enhanced Transformer with Diffusive Attention Gating Mechanism for Enzyme DDG Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the effect of amino acid mutations on enzyme thermodynamic stability (DDG) is fundamental to protein engineering and drug design. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2) transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with 6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling, with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein representations through learnable diffusion.</description>

      <title>TimeSearch-R: Adaptive Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding via Self-Verification Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV, filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably, TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1% improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at https://github.com/Time-Search/TimeSearch-R.</description>

      <title>Joint Verification and Refinement of Language Models for Safety-Constrained Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models possess impressive capabilities in generating programs (e.g., Python) from natural language descriptions to execute robotic tasks. However, these generated programs often contain errors that violate externally given task specifications. Without an effective method to verify their correctness, the reliable deployment of language models in real-world systems is practically infeasible. We develop a method that converts generated robot programs into an automaton-based representation and verifies them against task-relevant safety specifications. We establish a theorem that any arbitrary combination of the verified programs will also satisfy the safety specifications. Hence, the method eliminates the need to verify complex programs composed of multiple simpler ones, reducing computation complexity. We then introduce an automated fine-tuning procedure that leverages verification outcomes for supervision. By applying the theorem, this procedure only requires training the model to generate safe sub-components, thereby improving training efficiency. Empirical results on robot applications show a 30 percent increase in the probability of generating specification-compliant programs, with training time reduced by half compared to fine-tuning on generating full programs.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Diffusion Model for Structure-informed Antibody Design and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antibodies are essential proteins responsible for immune responses in organisms, capable of specifically recognizing antigen molecules of pathogens. Recent advances in generative models have significantly enhanced rational antibody design. However, existing methods mainly create antibodies from scratch without template constraints, leading to model optimization challenges and unnatural sequences. To address these issues, we propose a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework, termed RADAb, for efficient antibody design. Our method leverages a set of structural homologous motifs that align with query structural constraints to guide the generative model in inversely optimizing antibodies according to desired design criteria. Specifically, we introduce a structure-informed retrieval mechanism that integrates these exemplar motifs with the input backbone through a novel dual-branch denoising module, utilizing both structural and evolutionary information. Additionally, we develop a conditional diffusion model that iteratively refines the optimization process by incorporating both global context and local evolutionary conditions. Our approach is agnostic to the choice of generative models. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple antibody inverse folding and optimization tasks, offering a new perspective on biomolecular generative models.</description>

      <title>Wider or Deeper? Scaling LLM Inference-Time Compute with Adaptive Branching Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04412v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit human-like cognitive patterns under four established frameworks from psychology: Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), Framing Bias, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), and Cognitive Dissonance. We evaluated several proprietary and open-source models using structured prompts and automated scoring. Our findings reveal that these models often produce coherent narratives, show susceptibility to positive framing, exhibit moral judgments aligned with Liberty/Oppression concerns, and demonstrate self-contradictions tempered by extensive rationalization. Such behaviors mirror human cognitive tendencies yet are shaped by their training data and alignment methods. We discuss the implications for AI transparency, ethical deployment, and future work that bridges cognitive psychology and AI safety</description>

      <title>Introducing LongCat-Flash-Thinking: A Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning. Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result, LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5% (from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems and agentic AI research.</description>

      <title>Bilinear relational structure fixes reversal curse and enables consistent model editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.</description>

      <title>Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec): A Unified Representation for AI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04173v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of agent frameworks has led to fragmentation in how agents are defined, executed, and evaluated. Existing systems differ in their abstractions, data flow semantics, and tool integrations, making it difficult to share or reproduce workflows. We introduce Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec), a declarative language that defines AI agents and agentic workflows in a way that is compatible across frameworks, promoting reusability, portability and interoperability of AI agents. Agent Spec defines a common set of components, control and data flow semantics, and schemas that allow an agent to be defined once and executed across different runtimes. Agent Spec also introduces a standardized Evaluation harness to assess agent behavior and agentic workflows across runtimes - analogous to how HELM and related harnesses standardized LLM evaluation - so that performance, robustness, and efficiency can be compared consistently across frameworks. We demonstrate this using four distinct runtimes (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and WayFlow) evaluated over three different benchmarks (SimpleQA Verified, $\tau^2$-Bench and BIRD-SQL). We provide accompanying toolsets: a Python SDK (PyAgentSpec), a reference runtime (WayFlow), and adapters for popular frameworks (e.g., LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI). Agent Spec bridges the gap between model-centric and agent-centric standardization &amp; evaluation, laying the groundwork for reliable, reusable, and portable agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Internal World Models as Imagination Networks in Cognitive Agents</title>

Abstract: What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents. Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>HugAgent: Benchmarking LLMs for Simulation of Individualized Human Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has long been a central aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines, we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), which rethinks human reasoning simulation along three dimensions: (i) from averaged to individualized reasoning, (ii) from behavioral mimicry to cognitive alignment, and (iii) from vignette-based to open-ended data. The benchmark evaluates whether a model can predict a specific person's behavioral responses and the underlying reasoning dynamics in out-of-distribution scenarios, given partial evidence of their prior views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a human track that automates and scales the think-aloud method to collect ecologically valid human reasoning data, and a synthetic track for further scalability and systematic stress testing. This architecture enables low-cost, extensible expansion to new tasks and populations. Experiments with state-of-the-art language models reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the individuality of human thought. The benchmark, along with its complete data collection pipeline and companion chatbot, is open-sourced as HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/trace-your-thinking).</description>

      <title>String Seed of Thought: Prompting LLMs for Distribution-Faithful and Diverse Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options, each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation, content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.</description>

      <title>How Do AI Agents Do Human Work? Comparing AI and Human Workflows Across Diverse Occupations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering, computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.</description>

      <title>From Observability Data to Diagnosis: An Evolving Multi-agent System for Incident Management in Cloud Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper, we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop. Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Knowledge Search over Verifiable Reasoning: Synthesizing a Scientific Encyclopedia from a Long Chains-of-Thought Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base, this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia.</description>

      <title>Orion-MSP: Multi-Scale Sparse Attention for Tabular In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet, developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However, current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1) multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2) block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new standard for efficient tabular in-context learning. The model is publicly available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-MSP .</description>

      <title>A Proprietary Model-Based Safety Response Framework for AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level, the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score, validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios. This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building high-security, high-trust LLM applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued: most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies, randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class human players.</description>

      <title>Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV): Formalising Metacognitive Theory for Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences (from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.12689v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The agent-based modelling community has a debate on how ``intelligent'' artificial agents should be, and in what ways their local intelligence relates to the emergence of a collective intelligence. I approach this debate by endowing the preys and predators of the Lotka-Volterra model with behavioral algorithms characterized by different levels of sophistication. The main finding is that by endowing both preys and predators with the capability of making predictions based on linear extrapolation a novel sort of dynamic equilibrium appears, where both species co-exist while both populations grow indefinitely. While this broadly confirms that, in general, relatively simple agents favor the emergence of complex collective behavior, it also suggests that one fundamental mechanism is that the capability of individuals to take first-order derivatives of one other's behavior can allow the collective computation of derivatives of any order.</description>

      <title>Learning for Interval Prediction of Electricity Demand: A Cluster-based Bootstrapping Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate predictions of electricity demands are necessary for managing operations in a small aggregation load setting like a Microgrid. Due to low aggregation, the electricity demands can be highly stochastic and point estimates would lead to inflated errors. Interval estimation in this scenario, would provide a range of values within which the future values might lie and helps quantify the errors around the point estimates. This paper introduces a residual bootstrap algorithm to generate interval estimates of day-ahead electricity demand. A machine learning algorithm is used to obtain the point estimates of electricity demand and respective residuals on the training set. The obtained residuals are stored in memory and the memory is further partitioned. Days with similar demand patterns are grouped in clusters using an unsupervised learning algorithm and these clusters are used to partition the memory. The point estimates for test day are used to find the closest cluster of similar days and the residuals are bootstrapped from the chosen cluster. This algorithm is evaluated on the real electricity demand data from EULR(End Use Load Research) and is compared to other bootstrapping methods for varying confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Training Dynamics of Private Fine-tuning with Langevin diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that differentially private full fine-tuning (DP-FFT) can distort pre-trained backbone features based on both theoretical and empirical results. We identify the cause of the distortion as the misalignment between the pre-trained backbone and the randomly initialized linear head. We prove that a sequential fine-tuning strategy can mitigate the feature distortion: first-linear-probing-then-fine-tuning (DP-LP-FFT). A new approximation scheme allows us to derive approximate upper and lower bounds on the training loss of DP-LP and DP-FFT, in a simple but canonical setting of 2-layer neural networks with ReLU activation. Experiments on real-world datasets and architectures are consistent with our theoretical insights. We also derive new upper bounds for 2-layer linear networks without the approximation. Moreover, our theory suggests a trade-off of privacy budget allocation in multi-phase fine-tuning methods like DP-LP-FFT.</description>

Abstract: We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework for tactical decision making in an autonomous truck, specifically for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lane change maneuvers in a highway scenario. Our results demonstrate that it is beneficial to separate high-level decision-making processes and low-level control actions between the reinforcement learning agent and the low-level controllers based on physical models. In the following, we study optimizing the performance with a realistic and multi-objective reward function based on Total Cost of Operation (TCOP) of the truck using different approaches; by adding weights to reward components, by normalizing the reward components and by using curriculum learning techniques.</description>

      <title>FunOTTA: On-the-Fly Adaptation on Cross-Domain Fundus Image via Stable Test-time Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundus images are essential for the early screening and detection of eye diseases. While deep learning models using fundus images have significantly advanced the diagnosis of multiple eye diseases, variations in images from different imaging devices and locations (known as domain shifts) pose challenges for deploying pre-trained models in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a novel Fundus On-the-fly Test-Time Adaptation (FunOTTA) framework that effectively generalizes a fundus image diagnosis model to unseen environments, even under strong domain shifts. FunOTTA stands out for its stable adaptation process by performing dynamic disambiguation in the memory bank while minimizing harmful prior knowledge bias. We also introduce a new training objective during adaptation that enables the classifier to incrementally adapt to target patterns with reliable class conditional estimation and consistency regularization. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art test-time adaptation (TTA) pipelines. Experiments on cross-domain fundus image benchmarks across two diseases demonstrate the superiority of the overall framework and individual components under different backbone networks. Code is available at https://github.com/Casperqian/FunOTTA.</description>

      <title>Affordance-based Robot Manipulation with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01083v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous effort; second, effectively learning robot action trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot action trajectories guided by affordances in a supervised flow matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot action trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance achieves competitive performance and even outperforms some other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot action trajectories with flow matching leads to consistently favorable results in several robot manipulation benchmarks than some alternative behavior cloning methods. This includes more stable training and evaluation, and noticeably faster inference, while maintaining comparable generalization performance to diffusion policy, where flow matching performs marginally better in most cases. Our framework seamlessly unifies affordance learning and action generation with flow matching for robot manipulation.</description>

      <title>CTPD: Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery for Enhanced Multimodal Electronic Health Records Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, such as numerical time series and free-text clinical reports, has great potential in predicting clinical outcomes. However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>TOBUGraph: Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval for Enhanced LLM Performance Beyond RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the leading and most widely used techniques for enhancing LLM retrieval capabilities, but it still faces significant limitations in commercial use cases. RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Edge Computing: A Comprehensive Survey on Optimizing Large Models and AI Agents for Pervasive Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article surveys Cognitive Edge Computing as a practical and methodical pathway for deploying reasoning-capable Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous AI agents on resource-constrained devices at the network edge. We present a unified, cognition-preserving framework spanning: (1) model optimization (quantization, sparsity, low-rank adaptation, distillation) aimed at retaining multi-step reasoning under tight memory/compute budgets; (2) system architecture (on-device inference, elastic offloading, cloud-edge collaboration) that trades off latency, energy, privacy, and capacity; and (3) adaptive intelligence (context compression, dynamic routing, federated personalization) that tailors computation to task difficulty and device constraints. We synthesize advances in efficient Transformer design, multimodal integration, hardware-aware compilation, privacy-preserving learning, and agentic tool use, and map them to edge-specific operating envelopes. We further outline a standardized evaluation protocol covering latency, throughput, energy per token, accuracy, robustness, privacy, and sustainability, with explicit measurement assumptions to enhance comparability. Remaining challenges include modality-aware reasoning benchmarks, transparent and reproducible energy reporting, edge-oriented safety/alignment evaluation, and multi-agent testbeds. We conclude with practitioner guidelines for cross-layer co-design of algorithms, runtime, and hardware to deliver reliable, efficient, and privacy-preserving cognitive capabilities on edge devices.</description>

      <title>MMDocIR: Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval for Long Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal document retrieval aims to identify and retrieve various forms of multimodal content, such as figures, tables, charts, and layout information from extensive documents. Despite its increasing popularity, there is a notable lack of a comprehensive and robust benchmark to effectively evaluate the performance of systems in such tasks. To address this gap, this work introduces a new benchmark, named MMDocIR, that encompasses two distinct tasks: page-level and layout-level retrieval. The former evaluates the performance of identifying the most relevant pages within a long document, while the later assesses the ability of detecting specific layouts, providing a more fine-grained measure than whole-page analysis. A layout refers to a variety of elements, including textual paragraphs, equations, figures, tables, or charts. The MMDocIR benchmark comprises a rich dataset featuring 1,685 questions annotated by experts and 173,843 questions with bootstrapped labels, making it a valuable resource in multimodal document retrieval for both training and evaluation. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that (i) visual retrievers significantly outperform their text counterparts, (ii) MMDocIR training set effectively enhances the performance of multimodal document retrieval and (iii) text retrievers leveraging VLM-text significantly outperforms retrievers relying on OCR-text. Our dataset is available at https://mmdocrag.github.io/MMDocIR/.</description>

      <title>iTool: Reinforced Fine-Tuning with Dynamic Deficiency Calibration for Advanced Tool Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09766v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising approach to enhance their capabilities, especially for complex tasks. Synthesizing tool-use data through real-world simulations is an effective way to achieve this. However, our investigation reveals that training gains significantly decay as synthetic data increases. The model struggles to benefit from additional synthetic data, which fails to endow it with advanced tool-use capabilities in complex scenarios Moreover, we discovered that the above limitation usually manifests as a fragment deficiency (i.e., parameter errors) in response. To this end, we propose an iterative reinforced fine-tuning strategy designed to alleviate this limitation. This strategy involves: (1) enhancing the diversity of response for synthetic data through path exploration of Monte Carlo Tree Search. (2) iteratively pinpointing the model's deficiency by constructing fine-grained preference pairs, and then improving it by preference optimization algorithms for targeted improvement. The experiments show that our method achieves 13.11% better performance than the same-size base model. It achieves an improvement of 6.5% in complex scenarios compared to the baseline, and it also outperforms larger open-source and closed-source models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model merging, a method that combines the parameters and embeddings of multiple fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), offers a promising approach to enhance model performance across various tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper introduces Activation-Informed Merging (AIM), a technique that integrates the information from the activation space of LLMs into the merging process to improve performance and robustness. AIM is designed as a flexible, complementary solution that is applicable to any existing merging method. It aims to preserve critical weights from the base model, drawing on principles from continual learning (CL) and model compression. Utilizing a task-agnostic calibration set, AIM selectively prioritizes essential weights during merging. We empirically demonstrate that AIM significantly enhances the performance of merged models across multiple benchmarks. Our findings suggest that considering the activation-space information can provide substantial advancements in the model merging strategies for LLMs, with up to a 40% increase in benchmark performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks do not test Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on their interactive intelligence with human users, which is vital for developing general-purpose AI assistants. We design InterFeedback, an interactive framework, which can be applied to any LMM and dataset to assess this ability autonomously. On top of this, we introduce InterFeedback-Bench which evaluates interactive intelligence using two representative datasets, MMMU-Pro and MathVerse, to test 10 different open-source LMMs. Additionally, we present InterFeedback-Human, a newly collected dataset of 120 cases designed for manually testing interactive performance in leading models such as OpenAI-o1 and Claude-Sonnet-4. Our evaluation results indicate that even the state-of-the-art LMM, OpenAI-o1, struggles to refine its responses based on human feedback, achieving an average score of less than 50%. Our findings point to the need for methods that can enhance LMMs' capabilities to interpret and benefit from feedback.</description>

      <title>AIRepr: An Analyst-Inspector Framework for Evaluating Reproducibility of LLMs in Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate data analysis through executable code generation. Yet, data science tasks often admit multiple statistically valid solutions, e.g. different modeling strategies, making it critical to understand the reasoning behind analyses, not just their outcomes. While manual review of LLM-generated code can help ensure statistical soundness, it is labor-intensive and requires expertise. A more scalable approach is to evaluate the underlying workflows-the logical plans guiding code generation. However, it remains unclear how to assess whether an LLM-generated workflow supports reproducible implementations.
  To address this, we present AIRepr, an Analyst-Inspector framework for automatically evaluating and improving the reproducibility of LLM-generated data analysis workflows. Our framework is grounded in statistical principles and supports scalable, automated assessment. We introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies and benchmark them against standard prompting across 15 analyst-inspector LLM pairs and 1,032 tasks from three public benchmarks. Our findings show that workflows with higher reproducibility also yield more accurate analyses, and that reproducibility-enhancing prompts substantially improve both metrics. This work provides a foundation for transparent, reliable, and efficient human-AI collaboration in data science. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Large language models as uncertainty-calibrated optimizers for experimental discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery increasingly depends on efficient experimental optimization to navigate vast design spaces under time and resource constraints. Traditional approaches often require extensive domain expertise and feature engineering. While large language models, with their vast scientific knowledge, circumvent the feature engineering limitations, they lack the calibrated uncertainty estimates required for high-stakes decision making. Hence, current optimization methods force a choice between domain knowledge and reliability, with no principled approach that affords both. In this work, we show that training language models through the uncertainty-aware objectives of traditional optimization methods enables their use as reliable optimizers guided by natural language. By teaching LLMs from experimental outcomes under uncertainty, we transform their overconfidence from a fundamental limitation into a precise calibration mechanism. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reactions, a cornerstone of pharmaceutical synthesis, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-yielding reaction conditions, from 24% to 43% in 50 experimental iterations starting from 10 unsuccessful conditions. Across 19 diverse optimization problems spanning organic synthesis, materials science and catalysis, process chemistry, and molecular design, our approach ranks first on average, establishing a new paradigm for reliable, uncertainty-guided optimization with LLMs. Our approach can accelerate discovery by lowering the barrier to using powerful optimization methods, replacing the need for domain-specific feature engineering with more accessible natural language interfaces. These findings highlight that ensuring reliability through principled uncertainty quantification is critical for realizing the full potential of AI-guided experimentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the Pogobot, an open-source platform specifically designed for research at the interface of swarm robotics and active matter. Pogobot features vibration-based or wheel-based locomotion, fast infrared communication, and an array of sensors in a cost-effective package (approx. 250euros/unit). The platform's modular design, comprehensive API, and extensible architecture facilitate the implementation of swarm intelligence algorithms and collective motion. Pogobots offer an accessible alternative to existing platforms while providing advanced capabilities including directional communication between units and fast locomotion, all with a compact form factor. More than 200 Pogobots are already being used on a daily basis in several Universities to study self-organizing systems, programmable active matter, discrete reaction-diffusion-advection systems and computational models of social learning and evolution. This paper details the hardware and software architecture, communication protocols, locomotion mechanisms, and the infrastructure built around the Pogobots.</description>

      <title>XBreaking: Understanding how LLMs security alignment can be broken</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are fundamental actors in the modern IT landscape dominated by AI solutions. However, security threats associated with them might prevent their reliable adoption in critical application scenarios such as government organizations and medical institutions. For this reason, commercial LLMs typically undergo a sophisticated censoring mechanism to eliminate any harmful output they could possibly produce. These mechanisms maintain the integrity of LLM alignment by guaranteeing that the models respond safely and ethically. In response to this, attacks on LLMs are a significant threat to such protections, and many previous approaches have already demonstrated their effectiveness across diverse domains. Existing LLM attacks mostly adopt a generate-and-test strategy to craft malicious input. To improve the comprehension of censoring mechanisms and design a targeted attack, we propose an Explainable-AI solution that comparatively analyzes the behavior of censored and uncensored models to derive unique exploitable alignment patterns. Then, we propose XBreaking, a novel approach that exploits these unique patterns to break the security and alignment constraints of LLMs by targeted noise injection. Our thorough experimental campaign returns important insights about the censoring mechanisms and demonstrates the effectiveness and performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Taskmaster Deconstructed: A Quantitative Look at Tension, Volatility, and Viewer Ratings</title>

Abstract: Taskmaster is a British television show that combines comedic performance with a formal scoring system. Despite the appearance of structured competition, it remains unclear whether scoring dynamics contribute meaningfully to audience engagement. We conducted a statistical analysis of 162 episodes across 18 series, using fifteen episode-level metrics to quantify rank volatility, point spread, lead changes, and winner dominance. None of these metrics showed a significant association with IMDb ratings, even after controlling for series effects. Long-term trends suggest that average points have increased over time, while volatility has slightly declined and rank spread has remained stable. These patterns indicate an attempt to enhance competitive visibility without altering the show's structural equilibrium. We also analyzed contestant rank trajectories and identified five recurring archetypes describing performance styles. These patterns suggest that viewer interest is shaped more by contestant behavior than by game mechanics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Anytime Reasoning via Budget Relative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions, enhancing both training and token efficiency.</description>

      <title>RCCDA: Adaptive Model Updates in the Presence of Concept Drift under a Constrained Resource Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms deployed in real-world environments are often faced with the challenge of adapting models to concept drift, where the task data distributions are shifting over time. The problem becomes even more difficult when model performance must be maintained under adherence to strict resource constraints. Existing solutions often depend on drift-detection methods that produce high computational overhead for resource-constrained environments, and fail to provide strict guarantees on resource usage or theoretical performance assurances. To address these shortcomings, we propose RCCDA: a dynamic model update policy that optimizes ML training dynamics while ensuring compliance to predefined resource constraints, utilizing only past loss information and a tunable drift threshold. In developing our policy, we analytically characterize the evolution of model loss under concept drift with arbitrary training update decisions. Integrating these results into a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework produces a lightweight greedy-optimal policy that provably limits update frequency and cost. Experimental results on four domain generalization datasets demonstrate that our policy outperforms baseline methods in inference accuracy while adhering to strict resource constraints under several schedules of concept drift, making our solution uniquely suited for real-time ML deployments.</description>

      <title>Learning of Population Dynamics: Inverse Optimization Meets JKO Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning population dynamics involves recovering the underlying process that governs particle evolution, given evolutionary snapshots of samples at discrete time points. Recent methods frame this as an energy minimization problem in probability space and leverage the celebrated JKO scheme for efficient time discretization. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{iJKOnet}$, an approach that combines the JKO framework with inverse optimization techniques to learn population dynamics. Our method relies on a conventional $\textit{end-to-end}$ adversarial training procedure and does not require restrictive architectural choices, e.g., input-convex neural networks. We establish theoretical guarantees for our methodology and demonstrate improved performance over prior JKO-based methods.</description>

      <title>ProRefine: Inference-Time Prompt Refinement with Textual Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks like reasoning or planning, play a substantial role in many cutting-edge commercial applications, and continue to fascinate researchers across fields for their potential to accomplish expensive, complex tasks that, until recently, only humans have been trusted to do. These workflows depend critically on the prompts used to provide the roles models play in such workflows. Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to approach the performance of their larger counterparts. This highlights its potential for building more cost-effective and powerful hybrid AI systems, thereby democratizing access to high-performing AI.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction Adaptive to Unknown Subpopulation Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning models with uncertainty quantification, offering formal coverage guarantees under exchangeable data. However, these guarantees fail when faced with subpopulation shifts, where the test environment contains a different mix of subpopulations than the calibration data. In this work, we focus on unknown subpopulation shifts where we are not given group-information i.e. the subpopulation labels of datapoints have to be inferred. We propose new methods that provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage without explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. While existing methods in similar setups assume perfect subpopulation labels, our framework explicitly relaxes this requirement and characterizes conditions where formal coverage guarantees remain feasible. Further, our algorithms scale to high-dimensional settings and remain practical in realistic machine learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods reliably maintain coverage and effectively control risks in scenarios where standard conformal prediction fails.</description>

      <title>Know What You Don't Know: Uncertainty Calibration of Process Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated. Specifically, they tend to overestimate the success probability that a partial reasoning step will lead to a correct final answer, particularly when smaller LLMs are used to complete the reasoning trajectory. To address this, we present a calibration approach -- performed via quantile regression -- that adjusts PRM outputs to better align with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the compute budget based on the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach adapts to each instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective IAS, and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as desired.</description>

      <title>Progressive Inference-Time Annealing of Diffusion Models for Sampling from Boltzmann Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems, Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically lower energy function evaluations.

      <title>Less Greedy Equivalence Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step; rather than always applying the highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using prior knowledge, and can correct this knowledge when contradicted by data. Finally, LGES can use interventional data to refine the learned observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true equivalence class in the sample limit, even with misspecified knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to misspecified knowledge.

      <title>Conformal Information Pursuit for Interactively Guiding Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM proba- bilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized AI, yet they struggle with zero-shot deployment in real-world industrial settings due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific datasets. To bridge this gap, Superb AI introduces ZERO, an industry-ready vision foundation model that leverages multi-modal prompting (textual and visual) for generalization without retraining. Trained on a compact yet representative 0.9 million annotated samples from a proprietary billion-scale industrial dataset, ZERO demonstrates competitive performance on academic benchmarks like LVIS-Val and significantly outperforms existing models across 37 diverse industrial datasets. Furthermore, ZERO achieved 2nd place in the CVPR 2025 Object Instance Detection Challenge and 4th place in the Foundational Few-shot Object Detection Challenge, highlighting its practical deployability and generalizability with minimal adaptation and limited data. To the best of our knowledge, ZERO is the first vision foundation model explicitly built for domain-specific, zero-shot industrial applications.</description>

Abstract: Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.</description>

      <title>NMIXX: Domain-Adapted Neural Embeddings for Cross-Lingual eXploration of Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology, and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a 1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and +0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17494</link>

Abstract: In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models are expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated confidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system. Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver mobility.</description>

      <title>GAITEX: Human motion dataset of impaired gait and rehabilitation exercises using inertial and optical sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide a cost-effective approach to assessing human movement in clinical and everyday environments. However, developing the associated classification models for robust assessment of physiotherapeutic exercise and gait analysis requires large, diverse datasets that are costly and time-consuming to collect. We present a multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic and gait-related exercises, including correct and clinically relevant variants, recorded from 19 healthy subjects using synchronized IMUs and optical marker-based motion capture (MoCap). It contains data from nine IMUs and 68 markers tracking full-body kinematics. Four markers per IMU allow direct comparison between IMU- and MoCap-derived orientations. We additionally provide processed IMU orientations aligned to common segment coordinate systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics outputs, and visualization tools for IMU-derived orientations. The dataset is fully annotated with movement quality ratings and timestamped segmentations. It supports various machine learning tasks such as exercise evaluation, gait classification, temporal segmentation, and biomechanical parameter estimation. Code for postprocessing, alignment, inverse kinematics, and technical validation is provided to promote reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamics of Meta-Learning in Small Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining, producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications. Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and (iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller, shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and WandB logs are released.</description>

      <title>Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rate of Penetration (ROP) prediction is critical for drilling optimization yet remains challenging due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous characteristics of drilling data. Conventional empirical, physics-based, and standard machine learning models rely on oversimplified assumptions or intensive feature engineering, constraining their capacity to model long-term dependencies and intricate feature interactions. To address these issues, this study presents a new deep learning Hybrid LSTM-Trans-Mixer-Att framework that first processes input data through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling cycles. Subsequently, an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization refines the features. Concurrently, a parallel Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block introduced facilitates efficient cross-feature interaction modeling of static and categorical parameters, including lithological indices and mud properties. The feature representations extracted from the Enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer modules are integrated through a dedicated fusion layer. Finally, an adaptive attention mechanism then dynamically assigns contextual weights to salient features, enhancing discriminative representation learning and enabling high-fidelity ROP prediction. The proposed framework combines sequential memory, static feature interactions, global context learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution for the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Experimental validation on real-world drilling datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving an Rsquare of 0.9991 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly outperforming existing baseline and hybrid models.</description>

      <title>Ethics-Aware Safe Reinforcement Learning for Rare-Event Risk Control in Interactive Urban Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on embedding credible and transparent ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers, particularly to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists. Here, we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that augments standard driving objectives with ethics-aware cost signals. At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic, risk-sensitive Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level, polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our approach on closed-loop simulation environments derived from large-scale, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods in reducing risk to others while maintaining ego performance and comfort. This work provides a reproducible benchmark for Safe RL with explicitly ethics-aware objectives in human-mixed traffic scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically accountable autonomy that explicitly protects those most at risk in urban traffic environments. Across two interactive benchmarks and five random seeds, our policy decreases conflict frequency by 25-45% compared to matched task successes while maintaining comfort metrics within 5%.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Query: Unleashing the Power of LLMs in SQL-Aided Table Understanding via Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Extensive experiments across four models and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that CoQ achieves substantial accuracy improvements and significantly lowers invalid SQL rates compared to prior generic LLM-based, SQL-aided, and hybrid baselines, confirming its superior effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/ChainofQuery.</description>

      <title>What Matters in Data for DPO?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM alignment.</description>

      <title>AI Agentic Vulnerability Injection And Transformation with Optimized Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated vulnerability detection and repair systems. Data-driven approaches using deep learning models show promise but critically depend on the availability of large, accurately labeled datasets. Yet existing datasets either suffer from noisy labels, limited range of vulnerabilities, or fail to reflect vulnerabilities as they occur in real-world software. This also limits large-scale benchmarking of such solutions. Automated vulnerability injection provides a way to directly address these dataset limitations, but existing techniques remain limited in coverage, contextual fidelity, or injection success rates. In this paper, we present AVIATOR, the first AI-agentic vulnerability injection workflow. It automatically injects realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities for high-fidelity, diverse, large-scale vulnerability dataset generation. Unlike prior monolithic approaches, AVIATOR orchestrates specialized AI agents, function agents and traditional code analysis tools that replicate expert reasoning. It combines semantic analysis, injection synthesis enhanced with LoRA-based fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, as well as post-injection validation via static analysis and LLM-based discriminators. This modular decomposition allows specialized agents to focus on distinct tasks, improving robustness of injection and reducing error propagation across the workflow. Evaluations across three distinct benchmarks demonstrate that AVIATOR achieves 91%-95% injection success rates, significantly surpassing existing automated dataset generation techniques in both accuracy and scope of software vulnerabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce TimeCopilot, the first open-source agentic framework for forecasting that combines multiple Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) through a single unified API. TimeCopilot automates the forecasting pipeline: feature analysis, model selection, cross-validation, and forecast generation, while providing natural language explanations and supporting direct queries about the future. The framework is LLM-agnostic, compatible with both commercial and open-source models, and supports ensembles across diverse forecasting families. Results on the large-scale GIFT-Eval benchmark show that TimeCopilot achieves state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting performance at low cost. Our framework provides a practical foundation for reproducible, explainable, and accessible agentic forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>LimiX: Unleashing Structured-Data Modeling Capability for Generalist Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured data. This report presents LimiX-16M and LimiX-2M, two instantiations of our large structured-data models (LDMs). Both models treat structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. They are pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX models across 11 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. LimiX-16M consistently surpasses strong baselines, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. Notably, LimiX-2M delivers strong results under tight compute and memory budgets. We also present the first scaling law study for LDMs, revealing how data and model scaling jointly influence downstream performance and offering quantitative guidance for tabular foundation modeling. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are susceptible to various risks to security, privacy, and fairness. Most defenses are designed to protect against each risk individually (intended interactions) but can inadvertently affect susceptibility to other unrelated risks (unintended interactions). We introduce Amulet, the first Python library for evaluating both intended and unintended interactions among ML defenses and risks. Amulet is comprehensive by including representative attacks, defenses, and metrics; extensible to new modules due to its modular design; consistent with a user-friendly API template for inputs and outputs; and applicable for evaluating novel interactions. By satisfying all four properties, Amulet offers a unified foundation for studying how defenses interact, enabling the first systematic evaluation of unintended interactions across multiple risks.</description>

      <title>Amortized Latent Steering: Low-Cost Alternative to Test-Time Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time optimization remains impractical at scale due to prohibitive inference costs--techniques like iterative refinement and multi-step verification can require $10-100\times$ more compute per query than standard decoding. Latent space test-time optimization methods like LatentSeek offer a more direct approach by steering hidden representations, but still demand expensive per-query optimization loops with multiple backward passes. We propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it. Across GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks, ALS achieves $2-5\times$ speedup over iterative methods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101% improvement in efficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent optimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning techniques viable for production deployment. Code is available at https://github.com/negbuna/ALS.</description>

      <title>A Mega-Study of Digital Twins Reveals Strengths, Weaknesses and Opportunities for Further Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital representations of individuals ("digital twins") promise to transform social science and decision-making. Yet it remains unclear whether such twins truly mirror the people they emulate. We conducted 19 preregistered studies with a representative U.S. panel and their digital twins, each constructed from rich individual-level data, enabling direct comparisons between human and twin behavior across a wide range of domains and stimuli (including never-seen-before ones). Twins reproduced individual responses with 75% accuracy and seemingly low correlation with human answers (approximately 0.2). However, this apparently high accuracy was no higher than that achieved by generic personas based on demographics only. In contrast, correlation improved when twins incorporated detailed personal information, even outperforming traditional machine learning benchmarks that require additional data. Twins exhibited systematic strengths and weaknesses - performing better in social and personality domains, but worse in political ones - and were more accurate for participants with higher education, higher income, and moderate political views and religious attendance. Together, these findings delineate both the promise and the current limits of digital twins: they capture some relative differences among individuals but not yet the unique judgments of specific people. All data and code are publicly available to support the further development and evaluation of digital twin pipelines.</description>

      <title>Policy-as-Prompt: Turning AI Governance Rules into Guardrails for AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are used in regulated and safety-critical settings, organizations need effective ways to turn policy into enforceable controls. We introduce a regulatory machine learning framework that converts unstructured design artifacts (like PRDs, TDDs, and code) into verifiable runtime guardrails. Our Policy as Prompt method reads these documents and risk controls to build a source-linked policy tree. This tree is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers for real-time runtime monitoring. The system is built to enforce least privilege and data minimization. For conformity assessment, it provides complete provenance, traceability, and audit logging, all integrated with a human-in-the-loop review process. Evaluations show our system reduces prompt-injection risk, blocks out-of-scope requests, and limits toxic outputs. It also generates auditable rationales aligned with AI governance frameworks. By treating policies as executable prompts (a policy-as-code for agents), this approach enables secure-by-design deployment, continuous compliance, and scalable AI safety and AI security assurance for regulatable ML.</description>

      <title>Learning to Navigate Socially Through Proactive Risk Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the challenge.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning MedGemma for Clinical Captioning to Enhance Multimodal RAG over Malaysia CPGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.</description>

      <title>What Can String Probability Tell Us About Grammaticality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM grammatical evaluation.</description>

      <title>Enterprise Deep Research: Steerable Multi-Agent Deep Research for Enterprise Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As information grows exponentially, enterprises face increasing pressure to transform unstructured data into coherent, actionable insights. While autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise Deep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents (General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as validated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without any human steering. We release the EDR framework and benchmark trajectories to advance research on multi-agent reasoning applications.

      <title>Every Activation Boosted: Scaling General Reasoner to 1 Trillion Open Language Foundation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity, cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0, Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale, Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence. Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built upon the same base.</description>

      <title>CompressionAttack: Exploiting Prompt Compression as a New Attack Surface in LLM-Powered Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-powered agents often use prompt compression to reduce inference costs, but this introduces a new security risk. Compression modules, which are optimized for efficiency rather than safety, can be manipulated by adversarial inputs, causing semantic drift and altering LLM behavior. This work identifies prompt compression as a novel attack surface and presents CompressionAttack, the first framework to exploit it. CompressionAttack includes two strategies: HardCom, which uses discrete adversarial edits for hard compression, and SoftCom, which performs latent-space perturbations for soft compression. Experiments on multiple LLMs show up to 80% attack success and 98% preference flips, while remaining highly stealthy and transferable. Case studies in VSCode Cline and Ollama confirm real-world impact, and current defenses prove ineffective, highlighting the need for stronger protections.</description>

      <title>USF-MAE: Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities, offering real-time, radiation-free assessment across diverse clinical domains. However, interpretation of ultrasound images remains challenging due to high noise levels, operator dependence, and limited field of view, resulting in substantial inter-observer variability. Current Deep Learning approaches are hindered by the scarcity of large labeled datasets and the domain gap between general and sonographic images, which limits the transferability of models pretrained on non-medical data. To address these challenges, we introduce the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), the first large-scale self-supervised MAE framework pretrained exclusively on ultrasound data. The model was pre-trained on 370,000 2D and 3D ultrasound images curated from 46 open-source datasets, collectively termed OpenUS-46, spanning over twenty anatomical regions. This curated dataset has been made publicly available to facilitate further research and reproducibility. Using a Vision Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, USF-MAE reconstructs masked image patches, enabling it to learn rich, modality-specific representations directly from unlabeled data. The pretrained encoder was fine-tuned on three public downstream classification benchmarks: BUS-BRA (breast cancer), MMOTU-2D (ovarian tumors), and GIST514-DB (gastrointestinal stromal tumors). Across all tasks, USF-MAE consistently outperformed conventional CNN and ViT baselines, achieving F1-scores of 81.6%, 79.6%, and 82.4%, respectively. Despite not using labels during pretraining, USF-MAE approached the performance of the supervised foundation model UltraSam on breast cancer classification and surpassed it on the other tasks, demonstrating strong cross-anatomical generalization.</description>

      <title>Grounded in Reality: Learning and Deploying Proactive LLM from Offline Logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented LLM applications.</description>

      <title>AURA: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for AI-Driven Adaptive Conversational Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional online surveys provide limited personalization, often resulting in low engagement and superficial responses. Although AI survey chatbots improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality. We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.076 mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving assessment systems.</description>

      <title>The Future of Generative AI in Software Engineering: A Vision from Industry and Academia in the European GENIUS Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has recently emerged as a groundbreaking force in Software Engineering, capable of generating code, identifying bugs, recommending fixes, and supporting quality assurance. While its use in coding tasks shows considerable promise, applying GenAI across the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has not yet been fully explored. Critical uncertainties in areas such as reliability, accountability, security, and data privacy demand deeper investigation and coordinated action. The GENIUS project, comprising over 30 European industrial and academic partners, aims to address these challenges by advancing AI integration across all SDLC phases. It focuses on GenAI's potential, the development of innovative tools, and emerging research challenges, actively shaping the future of software engineering. This vision paper presents a shared perspective on the future of GenAI-driven software engineering, grounded in cross-sector dialogue as well as experiences and findings within the GENIUS consortium. The paper explores four central elements: (1) a structured overview of current challenges in GenAI adoption across the SDLC; (2) a forward-looking vision outlining key technological and methodological advances expected over the next five years; (3) anticipated shifts in the roles and required skill sets of software professionals; and (4) the contribution of GENIUS in realising this transformation through practical tools and industrial validation. This paper focuses on aligning technical innovation with business relevance. It aims to inform both research agendas and industrial strategies, providing a foundation for reliable, scalable, and industry-ready GenAI solutions for software engineering teams.</description>

      <title>Text to Robotic Assembly of Multi Component Objects using 3D Generative AI and Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in 3D generative AI have enabled the creation of physical objects from text prompts, but challenges remain in creating objects involving multiple component types. We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on the object's geometry and functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI and robotics.</description>

      <title>Retrofitters, pragmatists and activists: Public interest litigation for accountable automated decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the role of public interest litigation in promoting accountability for AI and automated decision-making (ADM) in Australia. Since ADM regulation faces geopolitical headwinds, effective governance will have to rely at least in part on the enforcement of existing laws. Drawing on interviews with Australian public interest litigators, technology policy activists, and technology law scholars, the paper positions public interest litigation as part of a larger ecosystem for transparency, accountability and justice with respect to ADM. It builds on one participant's characterisation of litigation about ADM as an exercise in legal retrofitting: adapting old laws to new circumstances. The paper's primary contribution is to aggregate, organise and present original insights on pragmatic strategies and tactics for effective public interest litigation about ADM. Naturally, it also contends with the limits of these strategies, and of the Australian legal system. Where limits are, however, capable of being overcome, the paper presents findings on urgent needs: the enabling institutional arrangements without which effective litigation and accountability will falter. The paper is relevant to law and technology scholars; individuals and groups harmed by ADM; public interest litigators and technology lawyers; civil society and advocacy organisations; and policymakers.</description>

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample size.</description>

      <title>NVIDIA Nemotron Nano V2 VL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Nemotron Nano V2 VL, the latest model of the Nemotron vision-language series designed for strong real-world document understanding, long video comprehension, and reasoning tasks. Nemotron Nano V2 VL delivers significant improvements over our previous model, Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-VL-8B, across all vision and text domains through major enhancements in model architecture, datasets, and training recipes. Nemotron Nano V2 VL builds on Nemotron Nano V2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer LLM, and innovative token reduction techniques to achieve higher inference throughput in long document and video scenarios. We are releasing model checkpoints in BF16, FP8, and FP4 formats and sharing large parts of our datasets, recipes and training code.</description>

      <title>On the Brittleness of CLIP Text Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal co-embedding models, especially CLIP, have advanced the state of the art in zero-shot classification and multimedia information retrieval in recent years by aligning images and text in a shared representation space. However, such modals trained on a contrastive alignment can lack stability towards small input perturbations. Especially when dealing with manually expressed queries, minor variations in the query can cause large differences in the ranking of the best-matching results. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the effect of multiple classes of non-semantic query perturbations in an multimedia information retrieval scenario. We evaluate a diverse set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations across multiple CLIP variants using the TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and the V3C1 video collection. Across models, we find that syntactic and semantic perturbations drive the largest instabilities, while brittleness is concentrated in trivial surface edits such as punctuation and case. Our results highlight robustness as a critical dimension for evaluating vision-language models beyond benchmark accuracy.</description>
