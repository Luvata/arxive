      <title>Movement Control of Smart Mosque's Domes using CSRNet and Fuzzy Logic Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mosques are worship places of Allah and must be preserved clean, immaculate, provide all the comforts of the worshippers in them. The prophet's mosque in Medina/ Saudi Arabia is one of the most important mosques for Muslims. It occupies second place after the sacred mosque in Mecca/ Saudi Arabia, which is in constant overcrowding by all Muslims to visit the prophet Mohammad's tomb. This paper aims to propose a smart dome model to preserve the fresh air and allow the sunlight to enter the mosque using artificial intelligence techniques. The proposed model controls domes movements based on the weather conditions and the overcrowding rates in the mosque. The data have been collected from two different resources, the first one from the database of Saudi Arabia weather's history, and the other from Shanghai Technology Database. Congested Scene Recognition Network (CSRNet) and Fuzzy techniques have applied using Python programming language to control the domes to be opened and closed for a specific time to renew the air inside the mosque. Also, this model consists of several parts that are connected for controlling the mechanism of opening/closing domes according to weather data and the situation of crowding in the mosque. Finally, the main goal of this paper has been achieved, and the proposed model has worked efficiently and specifies the exact duration time to keep the domes open automatically for a few minutes for each hour head.</description>

      <title>Advancing NLP Security by Leveraging LLMs as Adversarial Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper proposes a novel approach to advancing NLP security by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as engines for generating diverse adversarial attacks. Building upon recent work demonstrating LLMs' effectiveness in creating word-level adversarial examples, we argue for expanding this concept to encompass a broader range of attack types, including adversarial patches, universal perturbations, and targeted attacks. We posit that LLMs' sophisticated language understanding and generation capabilities can produce more effective, semantically coherent, and human-like adversarial examples across various domains and classifier architectures. This paradigm shift in adversarial NLP has far-reaching implications, potentially enhancing model robustness, uncovering new vulnerabilities, and driving innovation in defense mechanisms. By exploring this new frontier, we aim to contribute to the development of more secure, reliable, and trustworthy NLP systems for critical applications.</description>

      <title>Neural Cover Selection for Image Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In steganography, selecting an optimal cover image, referred to as cover selection, is pivotal for effective message concealment. Traditional methods have typically employed exhaustive searches to identify images that conform to specific perceptual or complexity metrics. However, the relationship between these metrics and the actual message hiding efficacy of an image is unclear, often yielding less-than-ideal steganographic outcomes. Inspired by recent advancements in generative models, we introduce a novel cover selection framework, which involves optimizing within the latent space of pretrained generative models to identify the most suitable cover images, distinguishing itself from traditional exhaustive search methods. Our method shows significant advantages in message recovery and image quality. We also conduct an information-theoretic analysis of the generated cover images, revealing that message hiding predominantly occurs in low-variance pixels, reflecting the waterfilling algorithm's principles in parallel Gaussian channels. Our code can be found at: https://github.com/karlchahine/Neural-Cover-Selection-for-Image-Steganography.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the role of human evaluation in LLM-based spoken document summarization systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of powerful LLMs has led to a paradigm shift in abstractive summarization of spoken documents. The properties that make LLMs so valuable for this task -- creativity, ability to produce fluent speech, and ability to abstract information from large corpora -- also present new challenges to evaluating their content. Quick, cost-effective automatic evaluations such as ROUGE and BERTScore offer promise, but do not yet show competitive performance when compared to human evaluations. We draw on methodologies from the social sciences to propose an evaluation paradigm for spoken document summarization explicitly tailored for generative AI content. We provide detailed evaluation criteria and best practices guidelines to ensure robustness in the experimental design, replicability, and trustworthiness of human evaluation studies. We additionally include two case studies that show how these human-in-the-loop evaluation methods have been implemented at a major U.S. technology company.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation for Automated Adaptive Rodent Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully optimized automation of behavioral training protocols for lab animals like rodents has long been a coveted goal for researchers. It is an otherwise labor-intensive and time-consuming process that demands close interaction between the animal and the researcher. In this work, we used a data-driven approach to optimize the way rodents are trained in labs. In pursuit of our goal, we looked at data augmentation, a technique that scales well in data-poor environments. Using data augmentation, we built several artificial rodent models, which in turn would be used to build an efficient and automatic trainer. Then we developed a novel similarity metric based on the action probability distribution to measure the behavioral resemblance of our models to that of real rodents.</description>

      <title>Human-Agent Coordination in Games under Incomplete Information via Multi-Step Intent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategic coordination between autonomous agents and human partners under incomplete information can be modeled as turn-based cooperative games. We extend a turn-based game under incomplete information, the shared-control game, to allow players to take multiple actions per turn rather than a single action. The extension enables the use of multi-step intent, which we hypothesize will improve performance in long-horizon tasks. To synthesize cooperative policies for the agent in this extended game, we propose an approach featuring a memory module for a running probabilistic belief of the environment dynamics and an online planning algorithm called IntentMCTS. This algorithm strategically selects the next action by leveraging any communicated multi-step intent via reward augmentation while considering the current belief. Agent-to-agent simulations in the Gnomes at Night testbed demonstrate that IntentMCTS requires fewer steps and control switches than baseline methods. A human-agent user study corroborates these findings, showing an 18.52% higher success rate compared to the heuristic baseline and a 5.56% improvement over the single-step prior work. Participants also report lower cognitive load, frustration, and higher satisfaction with the IntentMCTS agent partner.</description>

      <title>Backdoor in Seconds: Unlocking Vulnerabilities in Large Pre-trained Models via Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pre-trained models have achieved notable success across a range of downstream tasks. However, recent research shows that a type of adversarial attack ($\textit{i.e.,}$ backdoor attack) can manipulate the behavior of machine learning models through contaminating their training dataset, posing significant threat in the real-world application of large pre-trained model, especially for those customized models. Therefore, addressing the unique challenges for exploring vulnerability of pre-trained models is of paramount importance. Through empirical studies on the capability for performing backdoor attack in large pre-trained models ($\textit{e.g.,}$ ViT), we find the following unique challenges of attacking large pre-trained models: 1) the inability to manipulate or even access large training datasets, and 2) the substantial computational resources required for training or fine-tuning these models. To address these challenges, we establish new standards for an effective and feasible backdoor attack in the context of large pre-trained models. In line with these standards, we introduce our EDT model, an \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{D}ata-free, \textbf{T}raining-free backdoor attack method. Inspired by model editing techniques, EDT injects an editing-based lightweight codebook into the backdoor of large pre-trained models, which replaces the embedding of the poisoned image with the target image without poisoning the training dataset or training the victim model. Our experiments, conducted across various pre-trained models such as ViT, CLIP, BLIP, and stable diffusion, and on downstream tasks including image classification, image captioning, and image generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>1-2-3-Go! Policy Synthesis for Parameterized Markov Decision Processes via Decision-Tree Learning and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the advances in probabilistic model checking, the scalability of the verification methods remains limited. In particular, the state space often becomes extremely large when instantiating parameterized Markov decision processes (MDPs) even with moderate values. Synthesizing policies for such \emph{huge} MDPs is beyond the reach of available tools. We propose a learning-based approach to obtain a reasonable policy for such huge MDPs.
  The idea is to generalize optimal policies obtained by model-checking small instances to larger ones using decision-tree learning. Consequently, our method bypasses the need for explicit state-space exploration of large models, providing a practical solution to the state-space explosion problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by performing extensive experimentation on the relevant models from the quantitative verification benchmark set. The experimental results indicate that our policies perform well, even when the size of the model is orders of magnitude beyond the reach of state-of-the-art analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) Dataset: Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Bridging Communication Barrier among the Deaf Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) is the primary language used by the deaf community in Kenya. It is the medium of instruction from Pre-primary 1 to university among deaf learners, facilitating their education and academic achievement. Kenyan Sign Language is used for social interaction, expression of needs, making requests and general communication among persons who are deaf in Kenya. However, there exists a language barrier between the deaf and the hearing people in Kenya. Thus, the innovation on AI4KSL is key in eliminating the communication barrier. Artificial intelligence for KSL is a two-year research project (2023-2024) that aims to create a digital open-access AI of spontaneous and elicited data from a representative sample of the Kenyan deaf community. The purpose of this study is to develop AI assistive technology dataset that translates English to KSL as a way of fostering inclusion and bridging language barriers among deaf learners in Kenya. Specific objectives are: Build KSL dataset for spoken English and video recorded Kenyan Sign Language and to build transcriptions of the KSL signs to a phonetic-level interface of the sign language. In this paper, the methodology for building the dataset is described. Data was collected from 48 teachers and tutors of the deaf learners and 400 learners who are Deaf. Participants engaged mainly in sign language elicitation tasks through reading and singing. Findings of the dataset consisted of about 14,000 English sentences with corresponding KSL Gloss derived from a pool of about 4000 words and about 20,000 signed KSL videos that are either signed words or sentences. The second level of data outcomes consisted of 10,000 split and segmented KSL videos. The third outcome of the dataset consists of 4,000 transcribed words into five articulatory parameters according to HamNoSys system.</description>

      <title>Geometric Feature Enhanced Knowledge Graph Embedding and Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geospatial Knowledge Graphs (GeoKGs) model geoentities (e.g., places and natural features) and spatial relationships in an interconnected manner, providing strong knowledge support for geographic applications, including data retrieval, question-answering, and spatial reasoning. However, existing methods for mining and reasoning from GeoKGs, such as popular knowledge graph embedding (KGE) techniques, lack geographic awareness. This study aims to enhance general-purpose KGE by developing new strategies and integrating geometric features of spatial relations, including topology, direction, and distance, to infuse the embedding process with geographic intuition. The new model is tested on downstream link prediction tasks, and the results show that the inclusion of geometric features, particularly topology and direction, improves prediction accuracy for both geoentities and spatial relations. Our research offers new perspectives for integrating spatial concepts and principles into the GeoKG mining process, providing customized GeoAI solutions for geospatial challenges.</description>

      <title>Contextual Biasing to Improve Domain-specific Custom Vocabulary Audio Transcription without Explicit Fine-Tuning of Whisper Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenAI's Whisper Automated Speech Recognition model excels in generalizing across diverse datasets and domains. However, this broad adaptability can lead to diminished performance in tasks requiring recognition of specific vocabularies. Addressing this challenge typically involves fine-tuning the model, which demands extensive labeled audio data that is often difficult to acquire and unavailable for specific domains. In this study, we propose a method to enhance transcription accuracy without explicit fine-tuning or altering model parameters, using a relatively small training dataset. Our method leverages contextual biasing, to direct Whisper model's output towards a specific vocabulary by integrating a neural-symbolic prefix tree structure to guide the model's transcription output. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments using a validation dataset comprising maritime data collected within a simulated training environment. A comparison between the original Whisper models of varying parameter sizes and our biased model revealed a notable reduction in transcription word error rate and enhanced performance of downstream applications. Our findings suggest that this methodology holds promise for improving speech-to-text translation performance in domains characterized by limited vocabularies.</description>

      <title>Integrating Canonical Neural Units and Multi-Scale Training for Handwritten Text Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The segmentation-free research efforts for addressing handwritten text recognition can be divided into three categories: connectionist temporal classification (CTC), hidden Markov model and encoder-decoder methods. In this paper, inspired by the above three modeling methods, we propose a new recognition network by using a novel three-dimensional (3D) attention module and global-local context information. Based on the feature maps of the last convolutional layer, a series of 3D blocks with different resolutions are split. Then, these 3D blocks are fed into the 3D attention module to generate sequential visual features. Finally, by integrating the visual features and the corresponding global-local context features, a well-designed representation can be obtained. Main canonical neural units including attention mechanisms, fully-connected layer, recurrent unit and convolutional layer are efficiently organized into a network and can be jointly trained by the CTC loss and the cross-entropy loss. Experiments on the latest Chinese handwritten text datasets (the SCUT-HCCDoc and the SCUT-EPT) and one English handwritten text dataset (the IAM) show that the proposed method can make a new milestone.</description>

      <title>Link, Synthesize, Retrieve: Universal Document Linking for Zero-Shot Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the recent advancements in information retrieval (IR), zero-shot IR remains a significant challenge, especially when dealing with new domains, languages, and newly-released use cases that lack historical query traffic from existing users. For such cases, it is common to use query augmentations followed by fine-tuning pre-trained models on the document data paired with synthetic queries. In this work, we propose a novel Universal Document Linking (UDL) algorithm, which links similar documents to enhance synthetic query generation across multiple datasets with different characteristics. UDL leverages entropy for the choice of similarity models and named entity recognition (NER) for the link decision of documents using similarity scores. Our empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the UDL across diverse datasets and IR models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot cases. The developed code for reproducibility is included in https://github.com/eoduself/UDL</description>

      <title>Skywork-Reward: Bag of Tricks for Reward Modeling in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report, we introduce a collection of methods to enhance reward modeling for LLMs, focusing specifically on data-centric techniques. We propose effective data selection and filtering strategies for curating high-quality open-source preference datasets, culminating in the Skywork-Reward data collection, which contains only 80K preference pairs -- significantly smaller than existing datasets. Using this curated dataset, we developed the Skywork-Reward model series -- Skywork-Reward-Gemma-27B and Skywork-Reward-Llama-3.1-8B -- with the former currently holding the top position on the RewardBench leaderboard. Notably, our techniques and datasets have directly enhanced the performance of many top-ranked models on RewardBench, highlighting the practical impact of our contributions in real-world preference learning applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond Multiple-Choice Accuracy: Real-World Challenges of Implementing Large Language Models in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in the medical domain for their human-level capabilities, leading to increased efforts to explore their potential in various healthcare applications. However, despite such a promising future, there are multiple challenges and obstacles that remain for their real-world uses in practical settings. This work discusses key challenges for LLMs in medical applications from four unique aspects: operational vulnerabilities, ethical and social considerations, performance and assessment difficulties, and legal and regulatory compliance. Addressing these challenges is crucial for leveraging LLMs to their full potential and ensuring their responsible integration into healthcare.</description>

      <title>Gene-Metabolite Association Prediction with Interactive Knowledge Transfer Enhanced Graph for Metabolite Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of metabolic engineering, the quest for efficient and precise gene target identification for metabolite production enhancement presents significant challenges. Traditional approaches, whether knowledge-based or model-based, are notably time-consuming and labor-intensive, due to the vast scale of research literature and the approximation nature of genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) simulations. Therefore, we propose a new task, Gene-Metabolite Association Prediction based on metabolic graphs, to automate the process of candidate gene discovery for a given pair of metabolite and candidate-associated genes, as well as presenting the first benchmark containing 2474 metabolites and 1947 genes of two commonly used microorganisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) and Issatchenkia orientalis (IO). This task is challenging due to the incompleteness of the metabolic graphs and the heterogeneity among distinct metabolisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Interactive Knowledge Transfer mechanism based on Metabolism Graph (IKT4Meta), which improves the association prediction accuracy by integrating the knowledge from different metabolism graphs. First, to build a bridge between two graphs for knowledge transfer, we utilize Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) with external knowledge of genes and metabolites to help generate inter-graph links, significantly alleviating the impact of heterogeneity. Second, we propagate intra-graph links from different metabolic graphs using inter-graph links as anchors. Finally, we conduct the gene-metabolite association prediction based on the enriched metabolism graphs, which integrate the knowledge from multiple microorganisms. Experiments on both types of organisms demonstrate that our proposed methodology outperforms baselines by up to 12.3% across various link prediction frameworks.</description>

      <title>LLM as a code generator in Agile Model Driven Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT4 in the auto generation of code represents a significant advancement, yet it is not without its challenges. The ambiguity inherent in natural language descriptions of software poses substantial obstacles to generating deployable, structured artifacts. This research champions Model Driven Development (MDD) as a viable strategy to overcome these challenges, proposing an Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD) approach that employs GPT4 as a code generator. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the code auto generation process and offers agility that allows seamless adaptation to changes in models or deployment environments. We illustrate this by modeling a multi agent Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), significantly reducing model ambiguity by integrating the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for code structure meta modeling, and the FIPA ontology language for communication semantics meta modeling. Applying GPT4 auto generation capabilities yields Java and Python code that is compatible with the JADE and PADE frameworks, respectively. Our thorough evaluation of the auto generated code verifies its alignment with expected behaviors and identifies enhancements in agent interactions. Structurally, we assessed the complexity of code derived from a model constrained solely by OCL meta models, against that influenced by both OCL and FIPA ontology meta models. The results indicate that the ontology constrained meta model produces inherently more complex code, yet its cyclomatic complexity remains within manageable levels, suggesting that additional meta model constraints can be incorporated without exceeding the high risk threshold for complexity.</description>

      <title>SFB-net for cardiac segmentation: Bridging the semantic gap with attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past few years, deep learning algorithms have been widely used for cardiac image segmentation. However, most of these architectures rely on convolutions that hardly model long-range dependencies, limiting their ability to extract contextual information. In order to tackle this issue, this article introduces the Swin Filtering Block network (SFB-net) which takes advantage of both conventional and swin transformer layers. The former are used to introduce spatial attention at the bottom of the network, while the latter are applied to focus on high level semantically rich features between the encoder and decoder. An average Dice score of 92.4 was achieved on the ACDC dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this result outperforms any other work on this dataset. The average Dice score of 87.99 obtained on the M\&amp;amp;M's dataset demonstrates that the proposed method generalizes well to data from different vendors and centres.</description>

      <title>A framework for GNSS-based solutions performance analysis in an ERTMS context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context Progresses in GNSS-based solution introduction in rail applications GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is now used in most of our travels and each of our smartphone apps. Most of the usages are not safety-critical. But Europe identified GNSS for more applications and to be integrated in rail in general as part of the toolset to help railway to contribute to reduce transport carbon footprint. To increase the use of trains in European transports, railways must improve their attractiveness for passengers and freight, but also increase reliability, availability and efficiency by reducing capital expenditure and operational costs. GNSS is part of the global digitalization scheme of freight that aims to offer added value to the clients knowledge of accurate time of arrival, continuous monitoring of transport conditions (temperature, humidity...). But a major challenge will be to reach stringent applications and in particular, GNSS is today seen as a realistic and serious game changer for the future of the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System). The localisation function is today performed with both odometry and balises. Odometer provides a continuous train position in time from a reference point. But as the distance delivered by the odometer shows a growing bias with distance, due to wear and wheel sliding, the use of on-track balises allows to reduce this error. Future systems will be based on on-board localisation solutions with GNSS receivers. It will allow the development of new concepts for moving blocks, virtual coupling and automation. Its use for train integrity is also investigated. But the environmental conditions of track and surroundings configuration, i.e, tunnels, dense urban areas or vegetation often degrade positioning performance and thus its efficiency and safety. Indeed, GNSS satellites are moving and their visibility (availability and relative position from the receiver) vary with time. Moreover, for optimal performance, the system requires open sky environments, which are the cases of most of the aeronautical uses but not of train uses. Trains often circulate in areas where signal reception can be disturbed (multipath, intentional or unintentional interferences) and thus, performances degraded. If many progresses have been made in the past years to develop more robust receivers [Puccitelli, 2022], multi-sensor solutions [CLUG website] or missing tools such as Digital Maps [Crespillo, 2023], in projects such as the Shift2Rail Project X2Rail-5 or CLUG, some questions remain and in particular related to performance evaluation. How can we evaluate performances in a dynamic environment (train, satellite, obstacles)? How can we be sure that every configuration has been tested? What is the impact of a failure (inaccuracy, missed detection) on operation? Some of these issues are addressed in the on-going R2DATO project funded by Europe's rail.</description>

      <title>Scaling up Masked Diffusion Models on Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have shown promise in language modeling, yet their scalability and effectiveness in core language tasks, such as text generation and language understanding, remain underexplored. This paper establishes the first scaling law for MDMs, demonstrating a scaling rate comparable to autoregressive models (ARMs) and a relatively small compute gap. Motivated by their scalability, we train a family of MDMs with up to 1.1 billion (B) parameters to systematically evaluate their performance against ARMs of comparable or larger sizes. Fully leveraging the probabilistic formulation of MDMs, we propose a simple yet effective \emph{unsupervised classifier-free guidance} that effectively exploits large-scale unpaired data, boosting performance for conditional inference. In language understanding, a 1.1B MDM shows competitive results, outperforming the larger 1.5B GPT-2 model on four out of eight zero-shot benchmarks. In text generation, MDMs provide a flexible trade-off compared to ARMs utilizing KV-cache: MDMs match the performance of ARMs while being 1.4 times faster, or achieve higher quality than ARMs at a higher computational cost. Moreover, MDMs address challenging tasks for ARMs by effectively handling bidirectional reasoning and adapting to temporal shifts in data. Notably, a 1.1B MDM breaks the \emph{reverse curse} encountered by much larger ARMs with significantly more data and computation, such as Llama-2 (13B) and GPT-3 (175B).

      <title>PRACT: Optimizing Principled Reasoning and Acting of LLM Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Principled Reasoning and Acting (PRAct) framework, a novel method for learning and enforcing action principles from trajectory data. Central to our approach is the use of text gradients from a reflection and optimization engine to derive these action principles. To adapt action principles to specific task requirements, we propose a new optimization framework, Reflective Principle Optimization (RPO). After execution, RPO employs a reflector to critique current action principles and an optimizer to update them accordingly. We develop the RPO framework under two scenarios: Reward-RPO, which uses environmental rewards for reflection, and Self-RPO, which conducts self-reflection without external rewards. Additionally, two RPO methods, RPO-Traj and RPO-Batch, is introduced to adapt to different settings. Experimental results across four environments demonstrate that the PRAct agent, leveraging the RPO framework, effectively learns and applies action principles to enhance performance.</description>

      <title>Explainable News Summarization -- Analysis and mitigation of Disagreement Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for text summarization provide valuable understanding of how the summaries are generated. Recent studies have highlighted a major challenge in this area, known as the disagreement problem. This problem occurs when different XAI methods offer contradictory explanations for the summary generated from the same input article. This inconsistency across XAI methods has been evaluated using predefined metrics designed to quantify agreement levels between them, revealing significant disagreement. This impedes the reliability and interpretability of XAI in this area. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that utilizes sentence transformers and the k-means clustering algorithm to first segment the input article and then generate the explanation of the summary generated for each segment. By producing regional or segmented explanations rather than comprehensive ones, a decrease in the observed disagreement between XAI methods is hypothesized. This segmentation-based approach was used on two news summarization datasets, namely Extreme Summarization(XSum) and CNN-DailyMail, and the experiment was conducted using multiple disagreement metrics. Our experiments validate the hypothesis by showing a significant reduction in disagreement among different XAI methods. Additionally, a JavaScript visualization tool is developed, that is easy to use and allows users to interactively explore the color-coded visualization of the input article and the machine-generated summary based on the attribution scores of each sentences.</description>

      <title>SIKeD: Self-guided Iterative Knowledge Distillation for mathematical reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can transfer their reasoning skills to smaller models by teaching them to generate the intermediate reasoning process required to solve multistep reasoning tasks. While LLMs can accurately solve reasoning tasks through a variety of strategies, even without fine-tuning, smaller models are not expressive enough to fit the LLMs distribution on all strategies when distilled and tend to prioritize one strategy over the others. This reliance on one strategy poses a challenge for smaller models when attempting to solve reasoning tasks that may be difficult with their preferred strategy. To address this, we propose a distillation method SIKeD (Self-guided Iterative Knowledge Distillation for mathematical reasoning), where the LLM teaches the smaller model to approach a task using different strategies and the smaller model uses its self-generated on-policy outputs to choose the most suitable strategy for the given task. The training continues in a self-guided iterative manner, where for each training iteration, a decision is made on how to combine the LLM data with the self-generated outputs. Unlike traditional distillation methods, SIKeD allows the smaller model to learn which strategy is suitable for a given task while continuously learning to solve a task using different strategies. Our experiments on various mathematical reasoning datasets show that SIKeD significantly outperforms traditional distillation techniques across smaller models of different sizes.

      <title>Aligning CodeLLMs with Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last year has witnessed the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) across diverse domains. Among them, CodeLLMs have garnered particular attention because they can not only assist in completing various programming tasks but also represent the decision-making and logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, current CodeLLMs mainly focus on pre-training and supervised fine-tuning scenarios, leaving the alignment stage, which is important for post-training LLMs, under-explored. This work first identifies that the commonly used PPO algorithm may be suboptimal for the alignment of CodeLLM because the involved reward rules are routinely coarse-grained and potentially flawed. We then advocate addressing this using the DPO algorithm. Based on only preference data pairs, DPO can render the model rank data automatically, giving rise to a fine-grained rewarding pattern more robust than human intervention. We also contribute a pipeline for collecting preference pairs for DPO on CodeLLMs. Studies show that our method significantly improves the performance of existing CodeLLMs on benchmarks such as MBPP and HumanEval.</description>

      <title>AgentStore: Scalable Integration of Heterogeneous Agents As Specialized Generalist Computer Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital agents capable of automating complex computer tasks have attracted considerable attention due to their immense potential to enhance human-computer interaction. However, existing agent methods exhibit deficiencies in their generalization and specialization capabilities, especially in handling open-ended computer tasks in real-world environments. Inspired by the rich functionality of the App store, we present AgentStore, a scalable platform designed to dynamically integrate heterogeneous agents for automating computer tasks. AgentStore empowers users to integrate third-party agents, allowing the system to continuously enrich its capabilities and adapt to rapidly evolving operating systems. Additionally, we propose a novel core \textbf{MetaAgent} with the \textbf{AgentToken} strategy to efficiently manage diverse agents and utilize their specialized and generalist abilities for both domain-specific and system-wide tasks. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AgentStore surpasses the limitations of previous systems with narrow capabilities, particularly achieving a significant improvement from 11.21\% to 23.85\% on the OSWorld benchmark, more than doubling the previous results. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results further demonstrate AgentStore's ability to enhance agent systems in both generalization and specialization, underscoring its potential for developing the specialized generalist computer assistant. All our codes will be made publicly available in https://chengyou-jia.github.io/AgentStore-Home.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent cooperation through learning-aware policy gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interested individuals often fail to cooperate, posing a fundamental challenge for multi-agent learning. How can we achieve cooperation among self-interested, independent learning agents? Promising recent work has shown that in certain tasks cooperation can be established between learning-aware agents who model the learning dynamics of each other. Here, we present the first unbiased, higher-derivative-free policy gradient algorithm for learning-aware reinforcement learning, which takes into account that other agents are themselves learning through trial and error based on multiple noisy trials. We then leverage efficient sequence models to condition behavior on long observation histories that contain traces of the learning dynamics of other agents. Training long-context policies with our algorithm leads to cooperative behavior and high returns on standard social dilemmas, including a challenging environment where temporally-extended action coordination is required. Finally, we derive from the iterated prisoner's dilemma a novel explanation for how and when cooperation arises among self-interested learning-aware agents.</description>

      <title>GADT: Enhancing Transferable Adversarial Attacks through Gradient-guided Adversarial Data Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Transferable Adversarial Examples (TAE) are primarily generated by adding Adversarial Noise (AN). Recent studies emphasize the importance of optimizing Data Augmentation (DA) parameters along with AN, which poses a greater threat to real-world AI applications. However, existing DA-based strategies often struggle to find optimal solutions due to the challenging DA search procedure without proper guidance. In this work, we propose a novel DA-based attack algorithm, GADT. GADT identifies suitable DA parameters through iterative antagonism and uses posterior estimates to update AN based on these parameters. We uniquely employ a differentiable DA operation library to identify adversarial DA parameters and introduce a new loss function as a metric during DA optimization. This loss term enhances adversarial effects while preserving the original image content, maintaining attack crypticity. Extensive experiments on public datasets with various networks demonstrate that GADT can be integrated with existing transferable attack methods, updating their DA parameters effectively while retaining their AN formulation strategies. Furthermore, GADT can be utilized in other black-box attack scenarios, e.g., query-based attacks, offering a new avenue to enhance attacks on real-world AI applications in both research and industrial contexts.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Online Prediction of Time-varying Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for predicting missing values in time-varying graph signals by exploiting spatial and temporal smoothness. We leverage the power of LLM to achieve a message-passing scheme. For each missing node, its neighbors and previous estimates are fed into and processed by LLM to infer the missing observations. Tested on the task of the online prediction of wind-speed graph signals, our model outperforms online graph filtering algorithms in terms of accuracy, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in effectively addressing partially observed signals in graphs.</description>

      <title>AI Readiness in Healthcare through Storytelling XAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is rapidly advancing and radically impacting everyday life, driven by the increasing availability of computing power. Despite this trend, the adoption of AI in real-world healthcare is still limited. One of the main reasons is the trustworthiness of AI models and the potential hesitation of domain experts with model predictions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques aim to address these issues. However, explainability can mean different things to people with different backgrounds, expertise, and goals. To address the target audience with diverse needs, we develop storytelling XAI. In this research, we have developed an approach that combines multi-task distillation with interpretability techniques to enable audience-centric explainability. Using multi-task distillation allows the model to exploit the relationships between tasks, potentially improving interpretability as each task supports the other leading to an enhanced interpretability from the perspective of a domain expert. The distillation process allows us to extend this research to large deep models that are highly complex. We focus on both model-agnostic and model-specific methods of interpretability, supported by textual justification of the results in healthcare through our use case. Our methods increase the trust of both the domain experts and the machine learning experts to enable a responsible AI.</description>

      <title>Should We Really Edit Language Models? On the Evaluation of Edited Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model editing has become an increasingly popular alternative for efficiently updating knowledge within language models. Current methods mainly focus on reliability, generalization, and locality, with many methods excelling across these criteria. Some recent works disclose the pitfalls of these editing methods such as knowledge distortion or conflict. However, the general abilities of post-edited language models remain unexplored. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on various editing methods and different language models, and have following findings. (1) Existing editing methods lead to inevitable performance deterioration on general benchmarks, indicating that existing editing methods maintain the general abilities of the model within only a few dozen edits. When the number of edits is slightly large, the intrinsic knowledge structure of the model is disrupted or even completely damaged. (2) Instruction-tuned models are more robust to editing, showing less performance drop on general knowledge after editing. (3) Language model with large scale is more resistant to editing compared to small model. (4) The safety of the edited model, is significantly weakened, even for those safety-aligned models. Our findings indicate that current editing methods are only suitable for small-scale knowledge updates within language models, which motivates further research on more practical and reliable editing methods.

      <title>Applying Neural Monte Carlo Tree Search to Unsignalized Multi-intersection Scheduling for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic scheduling of access to shared resources by autonomous systems is a challenging problem, characterized as being NP-hard. The complexity of this task leads to a combinatorial explosion of possibilities in highly dynamic systems where arriving requests must be continuously scheduled subject to strong safety and time constraints. An example of such a system is an unsignalized intersection, where automated vehicles' access to potential conflict zones must be dynamically scheduled. In this paper, we apply Neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (NMCTS) to the challenging task of scheduling platoons of vehicles crossing unsignalized intersections. Crucially, we introduce a transformation model that maps successive sequences of potentially conflicting road-space reservation requests from platoons of vehicles into a series of board-game-like problems and use NMCTS to search for solutions representing optimal road-space allocation schedules in the context of past allocations. To optimize search, we incorporate a prioritized re-sampling method with parallel NMCTS (PNMCTS) to improve the quality of training data. To optimize training, a curriculum learning strategy is used to train the agent to schedule progressively more complex boards culminating in overlapping boards that represent busy intersections. In a busy single four-way unsignalized intersection simulation, PNMCTS solved 95\% of unseen scenarios, reducing crossing time by 43\% in light and 52\% in heavy traffic versus first-in, first-out control. In a 3x3 multi-intersection network, the proposed method maintained free-flow in light traffic when all intersections are under control of PNMCTS and outperformed state-of-the-art RL-based traffic-light controllers in average travel time by 74.5\% and total throughput by 16\% in heavy traffic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a transformative class of AI tools capable of revolutionizing various aspects of healthcare by generating human-like responses across diverse contexts and adapting to novel tasks following human instructions. Their potential application spans a broad range of medical tasks, such as clinical documentation, matching patients to clinical trials, and answering medical questions. In this primer paper, we propose an actionable guideline to help healthcare professionals more efficiently utilize LLMs in their work, along with a set of best practices. This approach consists of several main phases, including formulating the task, choosing LLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and deployment. We start with the discussion of critical considerations in identifying healthcare tasks that align with the core capabilities of LLMs and selecting models based on the selected task and data, performance requirements, and model interface. We then review the strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, to adapt standard LLMs to specialized medical tasks. Deployment considerations, including regulatory compliance, ethical guidelines, and continuous monitoring for fairness and bias, are also discussed. By providing a structured step-by-step methodology, this tutorial aims to equip healthcare professionals with the tools necessary to effectively integrate LLMs into clinical practice, ensuring that these powerful technologies are applied in a safe, reliable, and impactful manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of diffusion models has transformed synthetic media generation, offering unmatched realism and control over content creation. These advancements have driven innovation across fields such as art, design, and scientific visualization. However, they also introduce significant ethical and societal challenges, particularly through the creation of hyper-realistic images that can facilitate deepfakes, misinformation, and unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted material. In response, the need for effective detection mechanisms has become increasingly urgent. This review examines the evolving adversarial relationship between diffusion model development and the advancement of detection methods. We present a thorough analysis of contemporary detection strategies, including frequency and spatial domain techniques, deep learning-based approaches, and hybrid models that combine multiple methodologies. We also highlight the importance of diverse datasets and standardized evaluation metrics in improving detection accuracy and generalizability. Our discussion explores the practical applications of these detection systems in copyright protection, misinformation prevention, and forensic analysis, while also addressing the ethical implications of synthetic media. Finally, we identify key research gaps and propose future directions to enhance the robustness and adaptability of detection methods in line with the rapid advancements of diffusion models. This review emphasizes the necessity of a comprehensive approach to mitigating the risks associated with AI-generated content in an increasingly digital world.</description>

      <title>Guiding Empowerment Model: Liberating Neurodiversity in Online Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this innovative practice full paper, we address the equity gap for neurodivergent and situationally limited learners by identifying the spectrum of dynamic factors that impact learning and function. Educators have shown a growing interest in identifying learners' cognitive abilities and learning preferences to measure their impact on academic achievement. Often institutions employ one-size-fits-all approaches leaving the burden on disabled students to self-advocate or tolerate inadequate support. Emerging frameworks guide neurodivergent learners through instructional approaches, such as online education. However, these frameworks fail to address holistic environmental needs or recommend technology interventions, particularly for those with undisclosed learning or developmental disabilities and situational limitations. In this article, we integrate a neurodivergent perspective through secondary research of around 100 articles to introduce a Guiding Empowerment Model involving key cognitive and situational factors that contextualize day-to-day experiences affecting learner ability. We synthesize three sample student profiles that highlight user problems in functioning. We use this model to evaluate sample learning platform features and other supportive technology solutions. The proposed approach augments frameworks such as Universal Design for Learning to consider factors including various sensory processing differences, social connection challenges, and environmental limitations. We suggest that by applying the mode through technology-enabled features such as customizable task management, guided varied content access, and guided multi-modal collaboration, major learning barriers of neurodivergent and situationally limited learners will be removed to activate the successful pursuit of their academic goals.</description>

      <title>Improving Small-Scale Large Language Models Function Calling for Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. While these models excel in general complex reasoning tasks, they still face challenges in mathematical problem-solving and logical reasoning. To address these limitations, researchers have explored function calling abilities, allowing LLMs to execute provided functions and utilize their outputs for task completion. However, concentrating on specific tasks can be very inefficient for large-scale LLMs to be used, because of the expensive cost of training and inference stages they need in terms of computational resources. This study introduces a novel framework for training smaller language models in function calling, focusing on specific logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. The approach aims to improve performances of small-scale models for these tasks using function calling, ensuring a high level of accuracy. Our framework employs an agent that, given a problem and a set of callable functions, queries the LLM by injecting a description and examples of the usable functions into the prompt and managing their calls in a step-by-step reasoning chain. This process is used to create a dataset of correct and incorrect reasoning chain chat completions from a large-scale LLM. This dataset is used to train a smaller LLM using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), specifically employing the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) technique. Experimental results demonstrate how the proposed approach balances the trade-off between model size and performance, improving the ability of function calling for reasoning tasks, in smaller models.</description>

      <title>Schema-Guided Culture-Aware Complex Event Simulation with Multi-Agent Role-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex news events, such as natural disasters and socio-political conflicts, require swift responses from the government and society. Relying on historical events to project the future is insufficient as such events are sparse and do not cover all possible conditions and nuanced situations. Simulation of these complex events can help better prepare and reduce the negative impact. We develop a controllable complex news event simulator guided by both the event schema representing domain knowledge about the scenario and user-provided assumptions representing case-specific conditions. As event dynamics depend on the fine-grained social and cultural context, we further introduce a geo-diverse commonsense and cultural norm-aware knowledge enhancement component. To enhance the coherence of the simulation, apart from the global timeline of events, we take an agent-based approach to simulate the individual character states, plans, and actions. By incorporating the schema and cultural norms, our generated simulations achieve much higher coherence and appropriateness and are received favorably by participants from a humanitarian assistance organization.</description>

      <title>OSCAR: Operating System Control via State-Aware Reasoning and Re-Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential in automating complex tasks like web browsing and gaming. However, their ability to generalize across diverse applications remains limited, hindering broader utility. To address this challenge, we present OSCAR: Operating System Control via state-Aware reasoning and Re-planning. OSCAR is a generalist agent designed to autonomously navigate and interact with various desktop and mobile applications through standardized controls, such as mouse and keyboard inputs, while processing screen images to fulfill user commands. OSCAR translates human instructions into executable Python code, enabling precise control over graphical user interfaces (GUIs). To enhance stability and adaptability, OSCAR operates as a state machine, equipped with error-handling mechanisms and dynamic task re-planning, allowing it to efficiently adjust to real-time feedback and exceptions. We demonstrate OSCAR's effectiveness through extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks across desktop and mobile platforms, where it transforms complex workflows into simple natural language commands, significantly boosting user productivity. Our code will be open-source upon publication.</description>

      <title>ConceptDrift: Uncovering Biases through the Lens of Foundational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Datasets and pre-trained models come with intrinsic biases. Most methods rely on spotting them by analysing misclassified samples, in a semi-automated human-computer validation. In contrast, we propose ConceptDrift, a method which analyzes the weights of a linear probe, learned on top a foundational model. We capitalize on the weight update trajectory, which starts from the embedding of the textual representation of the class, and proceeds to drift towards embeddings that disclose hidden biases. Different from prior work, with this approach we can pin-point unwanted correlations from a dataset, providing more than just possible explanations for the wrong predictions. We empirically prove the efficacy of our method, by significantly improving zero-shot performance with biased-augmented prompting. Our method is not bounded to a single modality, and we experiment in this work with both image (Waterbirds, CelebA, Nico++) and text datasets (CivilComments).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect the epileptic seizure status of a subject presents a challenge to existing technologies aimed at providing timely and efficient diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to detect interictal and ictal periods of epileptic seizures using a spiking neural network (SNN). Our proposed approach provides an online and real-time preliminary diagnosis of epileptic seizures and helps to detect possible pathological conditions.To validate our approach, we conducted experiments using multiple datasets. We utilized a trained SNN to identify the presence of epileptic seizures and compared our results with those of related studies. The SNN model was deployed on Xylo, a digital SNN neuromorphic processor designed to process temporal signals. Xylo efficiently simulates spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with exponential input synapses. Xylo has much lower energy requirments than traditional approaches to signal processing, making it an ideal platform for developing low-power seizure detection systems.Our proposed method has a high test accuracy of 93.3% and 92.9% when classifying ictal and interictal periods. At the same time, the application has an average power consumption of 87.4 uW(IO power) + 287.9 uW(computational power) when deployed to Xylo. Our method demonstrates excellent low-latency performance when tested on multiple datasets. Our work provides a new solution for seizure detection, and it is expected to be widely used in portable and wearable devices in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Texture image generation has been studied for various applications, including gaming and entertainment. However, context-specific realistic texture generation for industrial applications, such as generating defect textures on railway components, remains unexplored. A mobile-friendly, LLM-based tool that generates fine-grained defect characteristics offers a solution to the challenge of understanding the impact of defects from actual occurrences. We introduce TextureMeDefect, an innovative tool leveraging an LLM-based AI-Inferencing engine. The tool allows users to create realistic defect textures interactively on images of railway components taken with smartphones or tablets. We conducted a multifaceted evaluation to assess the relevance of the generated texture, time, and cost in using this tool on iOS and Android platforms. We also analyzed the software usability score (SUS) across three scenarios. TextureMeDefect outperformed traditional image generation tools by generating meaningful textures faster, showcasing the potential of AI-driven mobile applications on consumer-grade devices.</description>

      <title>CUPID: A Real-Time Session-Based Reciprocal Recommendation System for a One-on-One Social Discovery Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces CUPID, a novel approach to session-based reciprocal recommendation systems designed for a real-time one-on-one social discovery platform. In such platforms, low latency is critical to enhance user experiences. However, conventional session-based approaches struggle with high latency due to the demands of modeling sequential user behavior for each recommendation process. Additionally, given the reciprocal nature of the platform, where users act as items for each other, training recommendation models on large-scale datasets is computationally prohibitive using conventional methods. To address these challenges, CUPID decouples the time-intensive user session modeling from the real-time user matching process to reduce inference time. Furthermore, CUPID employs a two-phase training strategy that separates the training of embedding and prediction layers, significantly reducing the computational burden by decreasing the number of sequential model inferences by several hundredfold. Extensive experiments on large-scale Azar datasets demonstrate CUPID's effectiveness in a real-world production environment. Notably, CUPID reduces response latency by more than 76% compared to non-asynchronous systems, while significantly improving user engagement.</description>

Traditional methods relying on single-modal data and discrete simulations fall short in optimizing intermodal systems holistically. These systems involve interconnected processes that affect shipping time, costs, emissions, and socio-economic factors. Developing digital twins for real-time awareness, predictive analytics, and urban logistics optimization requires extensive efforts in knowledge discovery, data integration, and multi-domain simulation. Recent advancements in generative AI offer new opportunities to streamline digital twin development by automating knowledge discovery and data integration, generating innovative simulation and optimization solutions. These models extend digital twins' capabilities by promoting autonomous workflows for data engineering, analytics, and software development. This paper proposes an innovative paradigm that leverages generative AI to enhance digital twins for urban research and operations. Using freight decarbonization as a case study, we propose a conceptual framework employing transformer-based language models to enhance an urban digital twin through foundation models. We share preliminary results and our vision for more intelligent, autonomous, and general-purpose digital twins for optimizing integrated freight systems from multimodal to synchromodal paradigms.</description>

      <title>Liver Cancer Knowledge Graph Construction based on dynamic entity replacement and masking strategies RoBERTa-BiLSTM-CRF model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18090</link>

Abstract: Background: Liver cancer ranks as the fifth most common malignant tumor and the second most fatal in our country. Early diagnosis is crucial, necessitating that physicians identify liver cancer in patients at the earliest possible stage. However, the diagnostic process is complex and demanding. Physicians must analyze a broad spectrum of patient data, encompassing physical condition, symptoms, medical history, and results from various examinations and tests, recorded in both structured and unstructured medical formats. This results in a significant workload for healthcare professionals. In response, integrating knowledge graph technology to develop a liver cancer knowledge graph-assisted diagnosis and treatment system aligns with national efforts toward smart healthcare. Such a system promises to mitigate the challenges faced by physicians in diagnosing and treating liver cancer.
  Methods: This paper addresses the major challenges in building a knowledge graph for hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis, such as the discrepancy between public data sources and real electronic medical records, the effective integration of which remains a key issue. The knowledge graph construction process consists of six steps: conceptual layer design, data preprocessing, entity identification, entity normalization, knowledge fusion, and graph visualization. A novel Dynamic Entity Replacement and Masking Strategy (DERM) for named entity recognition is proposed.
  Results: A knowledge graph for liver cancer was established, including 7 entity types such as disease, symptom, and constitution, containing 1495 entities. The recognition accuracy of the model was 93.23%, the recall was 94.69%, and the F1 score was 93.96%.</description>

      <title>Predicting Fine-grained Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia Based on Machine Learning and Smart Wearable Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) impact dementia care substantially, affecting both patients and caregivers. Effective management and early detection of BPSD are crucial to reduce the stress and burden on caregivers and healthcare systems. Despite the advancements in machine learning for dementia prediction, there is a considerable gap in utilizing these methods for BPSD prediction. This study aims to fill this gap by presenting a novel personalized framework for BPSD prediction, utilizing physiological signals from smart wearable devices. Our personalized fine-grained BPSD prediction method accurately predicts BPSD occurrences by extracting individual behavioral patterns, while the generalized models identify diverse patterns and differentiate between various BPSD symptoms. Detailed comparisons between the proposed personalized method and conventional generalized methods reveals substantial improvements across all performance metrics, including a 16.0% increase in AUC. These results demonstrate the potential of our proposed method in advancing dementia care by enabling proactive interventions and improving patient outcomes in real-world scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that leverages physiological signals from smart wearable devices to predict BPSD, marking a significant stride in dementia care research.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Radio Map Construction with Real Environments and Sparse Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio map construction based on extensive measurements is accurate but expensive and time-consuming, while environment-aware radio map estimation reduces the costs at the expense of low accuracy. Considering accuracy and costs, a first-predict-then-correct (FPTC) method is proposed by leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs). A primary radio map is first predicted by a radio map prediction GAN (RMP-GAN) taking environmental information as input. Then, the prediction result is corrected by a radio map correction GAN (RMC-GAN) with sparse measurements as guidelines. Specifically, the self-attention mechanism and residual-connection blocks are introduced to RMP-GAN and RMC-GAN to improve the accuracy, respectively. Experimental results validate that the proposed FPTC-GANs method achieves the best radio map construction performance, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised inter-intra period-aware ECG representation learning for detecting atrial fibrillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation is a commonly encountered clinical arrhythmia associated with stroke and increased mortality. Since professional medical knowledge is required for annotation, exploiting a large corpus of ECGs to develop accurate supervised learning-based atrial fibrillation algorithms remains challenging. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising recipe for generalized ECG representation learning, eliminating the dependence on expensive labeling. However, without well-designed incorporations of knowledge related to atrial fibrillation, existing SSL approaches typically suffer from unsatisfactory capture of robust ECG representations. In this paper, we propose an inter-intra period-aware ECG representation learning approach. Considering ECGs of atrial fibrillation patients exhibit the irregularity in RR intervals and the absence of P-waves, we develop specific pre-training tasks for interperiod and intraperiod representations, aiming to learn the single-period stable morphology representation while retaining crucial interperiod features. After further fine-tuning, our approach demonstrates remarkable AUC performances on the BTCH dataset, \textit{i.e.}, 0.953/0.996 for paroxysmal/persistent atrial fibrillation detection. On commonly used benchmarks of CinC2017 and CPSC2021, the generalization capability and effectiveness of our methodology are substantiated with competitive results.</description>

      <title>$M^3EL$: A Multi-task Multi-topic Dataset for Multi-modal Entity Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal Entity Linking (MEL) is a fundamental component for various downstream tasks. However, existing MEL datasets suffer from small scale, scarcity of topic types and limited coverage of tasks, making them incapable of effectively enhancing the entity linking capabilities of multi-modal models. To address these obstacles, we propose a dataset construction pipeline and publish $M^3EL$, a large-scale dataset for MEL. $M^3EL$ includes 79,625 instances, covering 9 diverse multi-modal tasks, and 5 different topics. In addition, to further improve the model's adaptability to multi-modal tasks, We propose a modality-augmented training strategy. Utilizing $M^3EL$ as a corpus, train the $\textit{CLIP}_{\textit{ND}}$ model based on $\textit{CLIP} (\textit{ViT}-\textit{B}-\textit{32})$, and conduct a comparative analysis with an existing multi-modal baselines. Experimental results show that the existing models perform far below expectations (ACC of 49.4%-75.8%), After analysis, it was obtained that small dataset sizes, insufficient modality task coverage, and limited topic diversity resulted in poor generalisation of multi-modal models. Our dataset effectively addresses these issues, and the $\textit{CLIP}_{\textit{ND}}$ model fine-tuned with $M^3EL$ shows a significant improvement in accuracy, with an average improvement of 9.3% to 25% across various tasks. Our dataset is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/M3EL.</description>

      <title>RRADistill: Distilling LLMs' Passage Ranking Ability for Document Re-Ranking of Long-Tail Queries in a Search Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding the semantic relationships between queries and documents, even with lengthy and complex long-tail queries. These queries are challenging for feedback-based rankings due to sparse user engagement and limited feedback, making LLMs' ranking ability highly valuable. However, the large size and slow inference of LLMs necessitate the development of smaller, more efficient models (sLLMs). Recently, integrating ranking label generation into distillation techniques has become crucial, but existing methods underutilize LLMs' capabilities and are cumbersome. Our research, RRADistill: Re-Ranking Ability Distillation, propose an efficient label generation pipeline and novel sLLM training methods for both encoder and decoder models. We introduce an encoder-based method using a Term Control Layer to capture term matching signals and a decoder-based model with a ranking layer for enhanced understanding. A/B testing on a Korean-based search platform, validates the effectiveness of our approach in improving re-ranking for long-tail queries.</description>

      <title>Gesture2Text: A Generalizable Decoder for Word-Gesture Keyboards in XR Through Trajectory Coarse Discretization and Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text entry with word-gesture keyboards (WGK) is emerging as a popular method and becoming a key interaction for Extended Reality (XR). However, the diversity of interaction modes, keyboard sizes, and visual feedback in these environments introduces divergent word-gesture trajectory data patterns, thus leading to complexity in decoding trajectories into text. Template-matching decoding methods, such as SHARK^2, are commonly used for these WGK systems because they are easy to implement and configure. However, these methods are susceptible to decoding inaccuracies for noisy trajectories. While conventional neural-network-based decoders (neural decoders) trained on word-gesture trajectory data have been proposed to improve accuracy, they have their own limitations: they require extensive data for training and deep-learning expertise for implementation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel solution that combines ease of implementation with high decoding accuracy: a generalizable neural decoder enabled by pre-training on large-scale coarsely discretized word-gesture trajectories. This approach produces a ready-to-use WGK decoder that is generalizable across mid-air and on-surface WGK systems in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), which is evident by a robust average Top-4 accuracy of 90.4% on four diverse datasets. It significantly outperforms SHARK^2 with a 37.2% enhancement and surpasses the conventional neural decoder by 7.4%. Moreover, the Pre-trained Neural Decoder's size is only 4 MB after quantization, without sacrificing accuracy, and it can operate in real-time, executing in just 97 milliseconds on Quest 3.</description>

      <title>RingGesture: A Ring-Based Mid-Air Gesture Typing System Powered by a Deep-Learning Word Prediction Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text entry is a critical capability for any modern computing experience, with lightweight augmented reality (AR) glasses being no exception. Designed for all-day wearability, a limitation of lightweight AR glass is the restriction to the inclusion of multiple cameras for extensive field of view in hand tracking. This constraint underscores the need for an additional input device. We propose a system to address this gap: a ring-based mid-air gesture typing technique, RingGesture, utilizing electrodes to mark the start and end of gesture trajectories and inertial measurement units (IMU) sensors for hand tracking. This method offers an intuitive experience similar to raycast-based mid-air gesture typing found in VR headsets, allowing for a seamless translation of hand movements into cursor navigation. To enhance both accuracy and input speed, we propose a novel deep-learning word prediction framework, Score Fusion, comprised of three key components: a) a word-gesture decoding model, b) a spatial spelling correction model, and c) a lightweight contextual language model. In contrast, this framework fuses the scores from the three models to predict the most likely words with higher precision. We conduct comparative and longitudinal studies to demonstrate two key findings: firstly, the overall effectiveness of RingGesture, which achieves an average text entry speed of 27.3 words per minute (WPM) and a peak performance of 47.9 WPM. Secondly, we highlight the superior performance of the Score Fusion framework, which offers a 28.2% improvement in uncorrected Character Error Rate over a conventional word prediction framework, Naive Correction, leading to a 55.2% improvement in text entry speed for RingGesture. Additionally, RingGesture received a System Usability Score of 83 signifying its excellent usability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational molecular design -- the endeavor to design molecules, with various missions, aided by machine learning and molecular dynamics approaches, has been widely applied to create valuable new molecular entities, from small molecule therapeutics to protein biologics. In the small data regime, physics-based approaches model the interaction between the molecule being designed and proteins of key physiological functions, providing structural insights into the mechanism. When abundant data has been collected, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) can be more directly constructed from experimental data, from which machine learning can distill key insights to guide the design of the next round of experiment design. Machine learning methodologies can also facilitate physical modeling, from improving the accuracy of force fields and extending them to unseen chemical spaces, to more directly enhancing the sampling on the conformational spaces. We argue that these techniques are mature enough to be applied to not just extend the longevity of life, but the beauty it manifests. In this perspective, we review the current frontiers in the research \&amp; development of skin care products, as well as the statistical and physical toolbox applicable to addressing the challenges in this industry. Feasible interdisciplinary research projects are proposed to harness the power of machine learning tools to design innovative, effective, and inexpensive skin care products.</description>

      <title>Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch Algorithm for Multimodal Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main challenge of multimodal optimization problems is identifying multiple peaks with high accuracy in multidimensional search spaces with irregular landscapes. This work proposes the Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithm, which addresses the challenge of multimodal optimization problems by introducing a specialized mechanism for each operator. Inspired by the evolution of the universe, Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch groups the best individuals of the population into cluster-based centers of mass and then expands them with a progressively lower disturbance to guarantee convergence. During this process, it (i) applies a distance-based filtering to remove unnecessary elites such that the ones on smaller peaks are not lost, (ii) promotes isolated individuals based on their niche count after clustering, and (iii) balances exploration and exploitation during offspring generation to target specific accuracy levels. Experimental results on twenty multimodal benchmark test functions show that Multiple Gloal Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch generally performs better or competitively with respect to other state-of-the-art multimodal optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Graph Neural Network for Enhanced EEG-Based Depression Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are becoming increasingly popular for EEG-based depression detection. However, previous GNN-based methods fail to sufficiently consider the characteristics of depression, thus limiting their performance. Firstly, studies in neuroscience indicate that depression patients exhibit both common and individualized brain abnormal patterns. Previous GNN-based approaches typically focus either on fixed graph connections to capture common abnormal brain patterns or on adaptive connections to capture individualized patterns, which is inadequate for depression detection. Secondly, brain network exhibits a hierarchical structure, which includes the arrangement from channel-level graph to region-level graph. This hierarchical structure varies among individuals and contains significant information relevant to detecting depression. Nonetheless, previous GNN-based methods overlook these individualized hierarchical information. To address these issues, we propose a Hybrid GNN (HGNN) that merges a Common Graph Neural Network (CGNN) branch utilizing fixed connection and an Individualized Graph Neural Network (IGNN) branch employing adaptive connections. The two branches capture common and individualized depression patterns respectively, complementing each other. Furthermore, we enhance the IGNN branch with a Graph Pooling and Unpooling Module (GPUM) to extract individualized hierarchical information. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>ENWAR: A RAG-empowered Multi-Modal LLM Framework for Wireless Environment Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in advancing network management and orchestration in 6G and beyond networks. However, existing LLMs are limited in domain-specific knowledge and their ability to handle multi-modal sensory data, which is critical for real-time situational awareness in dynamic wireless environments. This paper addresses this gap by introducing ENWAR, an ENvironment-aWARe retrieval augmented generation-empowered multi-modal LLM framework. ENWAR seamlessly integrates multi-modal sensory inputs to perceive, interpret, and cognitively process complex wireless environments to provide human-interpretable situational awareness. ENWAR is evaluated on the GPS, LiDAR, and camera modality combinations of DeepSense6G dataset with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Mistral-7b/8x7b and LLaMa3.1-8/70/405b. Compared to general and often superficial environmental descriptions of these vanilla LLMs, ENWAR delivers richer spatial analysis, accurately identifies positions, analyzes obstacles, and assesses line-of-sight between vehicles. Results show that ENWAR achieves key performance indicators of up to 70% relevancy, 55% context recall, 80% correctness, and 86% faithfulness, demonstrating its efficacy in multi-modal perception and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Improving Embedding Accuracy for Document Retrieval Using Entity Relationship Maps and Model-Aware Contrastive Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present APEX-Embedding-7B (Advanced Processing for Epistemic eXtraction), a 7-billion parameter decoder-only text Feature Extraction Model, specifically designed for Document Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks. Our approach employs two training techniques that yield an emergent improvement in factual focus: (1) Pre-convergence interrupted fine-tuning using Structured Entity Relationship Maps as training data input: designed to shift the model's attention and create a bias towards factual content rather than semantic style - this enhances plain text performance despite not being directly trained for it; and (2) Model-Aware Contrastive Sampling, creating a balanced and evenly distributed collation map of hard and soft negatives directly informed by the base model's competency. This combined methodology yields significant improvements, enhancing plain text query/document pair retrieval to achieve an absolute rank@1 accuracy of 90.86% (an increase of 6.26% compared to the next leading model) in our evaluation, and reducing training data input context size by an average of 37.71% compared to plain text for both queries and document texts. Based on our evaluations, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art standard in text feature extraction for longer context document retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>In-Context Code-Text Learning for Bimodal Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bimodal software analysis initially appeared to be within reach with the advent of large language models. Unfortunately, the complex interplay of natural language text and code in software engineering, presents unique challenges that prevent pretrained models to generalize to a variety of tasks. We postulate that in-context learning for the code-text bimodality is a promising avenue. This paper thus introduces a comprehensive study of in-context code-text learning, focusing on leveraging pretrained CodeLLAMA models.
  We consider a diverse dataset encompassing 23 software engineering tasks, which we transform in an in-context learning format. To effectively extract informative features, we propose a configurable prompt template. Our proposed pipeline, InCTRL, then unifies prompt learning across various software engineering tasks. Extensive evaluation on the study datasets demonstrates the superiority of INCTRL-models in few-shot performance, surpassing state-of-the-art models including the support model, CodeLLAMA. Typically, we observe that applied to the CodeLLAMA model, INCTRL brings improvements in terms of precision (at least about 12\%) and recall (up to 93.88\%) on various tasks. For example, on the task of program repair, INCTRL improves the BLEU score of CodeLLAMA by 85 points, while for clone detection, INCTRL achieves an improvement of 69 percentage points. Moreover, INCTRL-models offer state-of-the-art performance when using retrieval-augmented generation on individual downstream tasks. Finally, we qualitatively analyze the benefits of INCTRL over CodeLLAMA and open-source all models for broader impact.
  We make our code and dataset publicly available at: \begin{center}

      <title>NaVIP: An Image-Centric Indoor Navigation Solution for Visually Impaired People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor navigation is challenging due to the absence of satellite positioning. This challenge is manifold greater for Visually Impaired People (VIPs) who lack the ability to get information from wayfinding signage. Other sensor signals (e.g., Bluetooth and LiDAR) can be used to create turn-by-turn navigation solutions with position updates for users. Unfortunately, these solutions require tags to be installed all around the environment or the use of fairly expensive hardware. Moreover, these solutions require a high degree of manual involvement that raises costs, thus hampering scalability. We propose an image dataset and associated image-centric solution called NaVIP towards visual intelligence that is infrastructure-free and task-scalable, and can assist VIPs in understanding their surroundings. Specifically, we start by curating large-scale phone camera data in a four-floor research building, with 300K images, to lay the foundation for creating an image-centric indoor navigation and exploration solution for inclusiveness. Every image is labelled with precise 6DoF camera poses, details of indoor PoIs, and descriptive captions to assist VIPs. We benchmark on two main aspects: 1) positioning system and 2) exploration support, prioritizing training scalability and real-time inference, to validate the prospect of image-based solution towards indoor navigation. The dataset, code, and model checkpoints are made publicly available at https://github.com/junfish/VIP_Navi.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Compression with Bits-back Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel lossless compression method for compressing geometric attributes of point cloud data with bits-back coding. Our method specializes in using a deep learning-based probabilistic model to estimate the Shannon's entropy of the point cloud information, i.e., geometric attributes of the 3D floating points. Once the entropy of the point cloud dataset is estimated with a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE), we use the learned CVAE model to compress the geometric attributes of the point clouds with the bits-back coding technique. The novelty of our method with bits-back coding specializes in utilizing the learned latent variable model of the CVAE to compress the point cloud data. By using bits-back coding, we can capture the potential correlation between the data points, such as similar spatial features like shapes and scattering regions, into the lower-dimensional latent space to further reduce the compression ratio. The main insight of our method is that we can achieve a competitive compression ratio as conventional deep learning-based approaches, while significantly reducing the overhead cost of storage and/or communicating the compression codec, making our approach more applicable in practical scenarios. Throughout comprehensive evaluations, we found that the cost for the overhead is significantly small, compared to the reduction of the compression ratio when compressing large point cloud datasets. Experiment results show that our proposed approach can achieve a compression ratio of 1.56 bit-per-point on average, which is significantly lower than the baseline approach such as Google's Draco with a compression ratio of 1.83 bit-per-point.</description>

      <title>Towards Edge General Intelligence via Large Language Models: Opportunities and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge Intelligence (EI) has been instrumental in delivering real-time, localized services by leveraging the computational capabilities of edge networks. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) empowers EI to evolve into the next stage: Edge General Intelligence (EGI), enabling more adaptive and versatile applications that require advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, systematic exploration in this area remains insufficient. This survey delineates the distinctions between EGI and traditional EI, categorizing LLM-empowered EGI into three conceptual systems: centralized, hybrid, and decentralized. For each system, we detail the framework designs and review existing implementations. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance and throughput of various Small Language Models (SLMs) that are more suitable for development on edge devices. This survey provides researchers with a comprehensive vision of EGI, offering insights into its vast potential and establishing a foundation for future advancements in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Preference Alignment with Differentiable NDCG Ranking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences improves interaction quality and safety by ensuring outputs better reflect human values. A promising strategy involves Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), starting with collecting and ranking responses generated by a supervised fine-tuning model to refine alignment. Current methods (DPO) focus on learning from pairwise preference data, categorizing responses into preferred and less preferred pairs, and optimizing by maximizing pairwise margins. Recent studies have uncovered a substantial discrepancy between the theoretical aspirations of preference learning and its real-world results. Current preference alignment techniques underperform expectations, with ranking accuracies below $60\%$ on standard datasets. This suggests existing methods inadequately capture ideal preference relationships within sequences. To address this challenge, this paper introduces \underline{D}irect \underline{R}anking \underline{P}reference \underline{O}ptimization (DRPO), a novel method that views human preference alignment as a Learning-to-Rank (LTR) task. DRPO leverages NDCG, a widely used LTR metric, to optimize the ranking of responses within lists based on preference data, thereby enhancing ranking accuracies. Due to the nondifferentiability of NDCG, we propose diffNDCG loss, a differentiable approximation facilitated by a sorting network to simulate NDCG. Furthermore, to improve the quality of generated response, we propose a novel margin-based Adaptive Rank Policy Score. Extensive experiments have shown that DRPO outperforms existing baseline methods, enhancing the quality of the generated responses.</description>

Abstract: Radiology report generation is crucial in medical imaging,but the manual annotation process by physicians is time-consuming and labor-intensive, necessitating the develop-ment of automatic report generation methods. Existingresearch predominantly utilizes Transformers to generateradiology reports, which can be computationally intensive,limiting their use in real applications. In this work, we presentR2Gen-Mamba, a novel automatic radiology report genera-tion method that leverages the efficient sequence processingof the Mamba with the contextual benefits of Transformerarchitectures. Due to lower computational complexity ofMamba, R2Gen-Mamba not only enhances training and in-ference efficiency but also produces high-quality reports.Experimental results on two benchmark datasets with morethan 210,000 X-ray image-report pairs demonstrate the ef-fectiveness of R2Gen-Mamba regarding report quality andcomputational efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>SmartRAG: Jointly Learn RAG-Related Tasks From the Environment Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RAG systems consist of multiple modules to work together. However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Nobel Prize Literature with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the capabilities of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly the o1 model, in the context of literary analysis. The outputs of these models are compared directly to those produced by graduate-level human participants. By focusing on two Nobel Prize-winning short stories, 'Nine Chapters' by Han Kang, the 2024 laureate, and 'Friendship' by Jon Fosse, the 2023 laureate, the research explores the extent to which AI can engage with complex literary elements such as thematic analysis, intertextuality, cultural and historical contexts, linguistic and structural innovations, and character development. Given the Nobel Prize's prestige and its emphasis on cultural, historical, and linguistic richness, applying LLMs to these works provides a deeper understanding of both human and AI approaches to interpretation. The study uses qualitative and quantitative evaluations of coherence, creativity, and fidelity to the text, revealing the strengths and limitations of AI in tasks typically reserved for human expertise. While LLMs demonstrate strong analytical capabilities, particularly in structured tasks, they often fall short in emotional nuance and coherence, areas where human interpretation excels. This research underscores the potential for human-AI collaboration in the humanities, opening new opportunities in literary studies and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to advanced applications requires reliable structured output generation. Existing methods which often rely on rigid JSON schemas, can lead to unreliable outputs, diminished reasoning capabilities, and increased computational overhead, limiting LLMs' adaptability for complex tasks. We introduce Meaning Typed Prompting (MTP), a technique for efficient structured output generation that integrates types, meanings, and abstractions, such as variables and classes, into the prompting process. By utilizing expressive type definitions, MTP enhances output clarity and reduces dependence on complex abstractions, simplifying development, and improving implementation efficiency. This enables LLMs to understand relationships and generate structured data more effectively. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MTP outperforms existing frameworks in accuracy, reliability, consistency, and token efficiency. We present Semantix, a framework that implements MTP, providing practical insights into its application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Integer Programming (IP) approach for discovering the Markov Equivalent Class (MEC) of Bayesian Networks (BNs) through observational data. The MEC-IP algorithm utilizes a unique clique-focusing strategy and Extended Maximal Spanning Graphs (EMSG) to streamline the search for MEC, thus overcoming the computational limitations inherent in other existing algorithms. Our numerical results show that not only a remarkable reduction in computational time is achieved by our algorithm but also an improvement in causal discovery accuracy is seen across diverse datasets. These findings underscore this new algorithm's potential as a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners in causal discovery and BNSL, offering a significant leap forward toward the efficient and accurate analysis of complex data structures.</description>

      <title>Deep Autoencoder with SVD-Like Convergence and Flat Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential - without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Additionally, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods, paving the way for robust representation learning of high-dimensional, complex physical systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks for Functional Differential Equations: Cylindrical Approximation and Its Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first learning scheme for functional differential equations (FDEs). FDEs play a fundamental role in physics, mathematics, and optimal control. However, the numerical analysis of FDEs has faced challenges due to its unrealistic computational costs and has been a long standing problem over decades. Thus, numerical approximations of FDEs have been developed, but they often oversimplify the solutions. To tackle these two issues, we propose a hybrid approach combining physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the \textit{cylindrical approximation}. The cylindrical approximation expands functions and functional derivatives with an orthonormal basis and transforms FDEs into high-dimensional PDEs. To validate the reliability of the cylindrical approximation for FDE applications, we prove the convergence theorems of approximated functional derivatives and solutions. Then, the derived high-dimensional PDEs are numerically solved with PINNs. Through the capabilities of PINNs, our approach can handle a broader class of functional derivatives more efficiently than conventional discretization-based methods, improving the scalability of the cylindrical approximation. As a proof of concept, we conduct experiments on two FDEs and demonstrate that our model can successfully achieve typical $L^1$ relative error orders of PINNs $\sim 10^{-3}$. Overall, our work provides a strong backbone for physicists, mathematicians, and machine learning experts to analyze previously challenging FDEs, thereby democratizing their numerical analysis, which has received limited attention.

      <title>TabDPT: Scaling Tabular Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenges faced by neural networks on tabular data are well-documented and have hampered the progress of tabular foundation models. Techniques leveraging in-context learning (ICL) have shown promise here, allowing for dynamic adaptation to unseen data. ICL can provide predictions for entirely new datasets without further training or hyperparameter tuning, therefore providing very fast inference when encountering a novel task. However, scaling ICL for tabular data remains an issue: approaches based on large language models cannot efficiently process numeric tables, and tabular-specific techniques have not been able to effectively harness the power of real data to improve performance and generalization. We are able to overcome these challenges by training tabular-specific ICL-based architectures on real data with self-supervised learning and retrieval, combining the best of both worlds. Our resulting model -- the Tabular Discriminative Pre-trained Transformer (TabDPT) -- achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CC18 (classification) and CTR23 (regression) benchmarks with no task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating the adapatability and speed of ICL once the model is pre-trained. TabDPT also demonstrates strong scaling as both model size and amount of available data increase, pointing towards future improvements simply through the curation of larger tabular pre-training datasets and training larger models.</description>

      <title>ZIP-FIT: Embedding-Free Data Selection via Compression-Based Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data selection is crucial for optimizing language model (LM) performance on specific tasks, yet most existing methods fail to effectively consider the target task distribution.
  Current approaches either ignore task-specific requirements entirely or rely on approximations that fail to capture the nuanced patterns needed for tasks like Autoformalization or code generation.
  Methods that do consider the target distribution often rely on simplistic, sometimes noisy, representations, like hashed n-gram features, which can lead to collisions and introduce noise.
  We introduce ZIP-FIT, a data selection framework that uses gzip compression to directly measure alignment between potential training data and the target task distribution.
  In extensive evaluations on Autoformalization and Python code generation, ZIP-FIT significantly outperforms leading baselines like DSIR and D4.
  Models trained on ZIP-FIT-selected data achieve their lowest cross-entropy loss up to 85.1\% faster than baselines, demonstrating that better task alignment leads to more efficient learning.
  In addition, ZIP-FIT performs selection up to 65.8\% faster than DSIR and two orders of magnitude faster than D4.
  Notably, ZIP-FIT shows that smaller, well-aligned datasets often outperform larger but less targeted ones, demonstrating that a small amount of higher quality data is superior to a large amount of lower quality data.
  Our results imply that task-aware data selection is crucial for efficient domain adaptation, and that compression offers a principled way to measure task alignment.
  By showing that targeted data selection can dramatically improve task-specific performance, our work provides new insights into the relationship between data quality, task alignment, and model learning efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) presents a promising approach for addressing the complexity of Traffic Signal Control (TSC) in urban environments. However, existing platforms for MARL-based TSC research face challenges such as slow simulation speeds and convoluted, difficult-to-maintain codebases. To address these limitations, we introduce PyTSC, a robust and flexible simulation environment that facilitates the training and evaluation of MARL algorithms for TSC. PyTSC integrates multiple simulators, such as SUMO and CityFlow, and offers a streamlined API, empowering researchers to explore a broad spectrum of MARL approaches efficiently. PyTSC accelerates experimentation and provides new opportunities for advancing intelligent traffic management systems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Fragility of Multilingual LLMs against Fine-Tuning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked widespread concerns about their safety. Recent work demonstrates that safety alignment of LLMs can be easily removed by fine-tuning with a few adversarially chosen instruction-following examples, i.e., fine-tuning attacks. We take a further step to understand fine-tuning attacks in multilingual LLMs. We first discover cross-lingual generalization of fine-tuning attacks: using a few adversarially chosen instruction-following examples in one language, multilingual LLMs can also be easily compromised (e.g., multilingual LLMs fail to refuse harmful prompts in other languages). Motivated by this finding, we hypothesize that safety-related information is language-agnostic and propose a new method termed Safety Information Localization (SIL) to identify the safety-related information in the model parameter space. Through SIL, we validate this hypothesis and find that only changing 20% of weight parameters in fine-tuning attacks can break safety alignment across all languages. Furthermore, we provide evidence to the alternative pathways hypothesis for why freezing safety-related parameters does not prevent fine-tuning attacks, and we demonstrate that our attack vector can still jailbreak LLMs adapted to new languages.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization for robust robotic grasping using a sensorized compliant hand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the first tasks we learn as children is to grasp objects based on our tactile perception. Incorporating such skill in robots will enable multiple applications, such as increasing flexibility in industrial processes or providing assistance to people with physical disabilities. However, the difficulty lies in adapting the grasping strategies to a large variety of tasks and objects, which can often be unknown. The brute-force solution is to learn new grasps by trial and error, which is inefficient and ineffective. In contrast, Bayesian optimization applies active learning by adding information to the approximation of an optimal grasp. This paper proposes the use of Bayesian optimization techniques to safely perform robotic grasping. We analyze different grasp metrics to provide realistic grasp optimization in a real system including tactile sensors. An experimental evaluation in the robotic system shows the usefulness of the method for performing unknown object grasping even in the presence of noise and uncertainty inherent to a real-world environment.</description>

      <title>E2E-Swin-Unet++: An Enhanced End-to-End Swin-Unet Architecture With Dual Decoders For PTMC Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently managing papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) while minimizing patient discomfort poses a significant clinical challenge. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) offers a less invasive alternative to surgery and radiation therapy for PTMC treatment, characterized by shorter recovery times and reduced pain. As an image-guided procedure, RFA generates localized heat by delivering high-frequency electrical currents through electrodes to the targeted area under ultrasound imaging guidance. However, the precision and skill required by operators for accurate guidance using current ultrasound B-mode imaging technologies remain significant challenges. To address these challenges, we develop a novel AI segmentation model, E2E-Swin-Unet++. This model enhances ultrasound B-mode imaging by enabling real-time identification and segmentation of PTMC tumors and monitoring of the region of interest for precise targeting during treatment. E2E-Swin- Unet++ is an advanced end-to-end extension of the Swin-Unet architecture, incorporating thyroid region information to minimize the risk of false PTMC segmentation while providing fast inference capabilities. Experimental results on a real clinical RFA dataset demonstrate the superior performance of E2E-Swin-Unet++ compared to related models. Our proposed solution significantly improves the precision and control of RFA ablation treatment by enabling real-time identification and segmentation of PTMC margins during the procedure.</description>

      <title>Characterising Open Source Co-opetition in Company-hosted Open Source Software Projects: The Cases of PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Companies, including market rivals, have long collaborated on the development of open source software (OSS), resulting in a tangle of co-operation and competition known as "open source co-opetition". While prior work investigates open source co-opetition in OSS projects that are hosted by vendor-neutral foundations, we have a limited understanding thereof in OSS projects that are hosted and governed by one company. Given their prevalence, it is timely to investigate open source co-opetition in such contexts. Towards this end, we conduct a mixed-methods analysis of three company-hosted OSS projects in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry: Meta's PyTorch (prior to its donation to the Linux Foundation), Google's TensorFlow, and Hugging Face's Transformers. We contribute three key findings. First, while the projects exhibit similar code authorship patterns between host and external companies (80%/20% of commits), collaborations are structured differently (e.g., decentralised vs. hub-and-spoke networks). Second, host and external companies engage in strategic, non-strategic, and contractual collaborations, with varying incentives and collaboration practices. Some of the observed collaborations are specific to the AI industry (e.g., hardware-software optimizations or AI model integrations), while others are typical of the broader software industry (e.g., bug fixing or task outsourcing). Third, single-vendor governance creates a power imbalance that influences open source co-opetition practices and possibilities, from the host company's singular decision-making power (e.g., the risk of license change) to their community involvement strategy (e.g., from over-control to over-delegation). We conclude with recommendations for future research.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inference for Augmented Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance the capabilities of standalone LLMs by integrating external data sources through API calls. In interactive LLM applications, efficient scheduling is crucial for maintaining low request completion times, directly impacting user engagement. However, these augmentations introduce scheduling challenges due to the need to manage limited memory for cached information (KV caches). As a result, traditional size-based scheduling algorithms, such as Shortest Job First (SJF), become less effective at minimizing completion times. Existing work focuses only on handling requests during API calls by preserving, discarding, or swapping memory without considering how to schedule requests with API calls. In this paper, we propose LAMPS, a novel LLM inference framework for augmented LLMs. LAMPS minimizes request completion time through a unified scheduling approach that considers the total length of requests and their handling strategies during API calls. Recognizing that LLM inference is memory-bound, our approach ranks requests based on their consumption of memory over time, which depends on both the output sizes and how a request is managed during its API calls. To implement our scheduling, LAMPS predicts the strategy that minimizes memory waste of a request during its API calls, aligning with but improving upon existing approaches. We also propose starvation prevention techniques and optimizations to mitigate the overhead of our scheduling. We implement LAMPS on top of vLLM and evaluate its performance against baseline LLM inference systems, demonstrating improvements in end-to-end latency by 27%-85% and reductions in TTFT by 4%-96% compared to the existing augmented-LLM system, with even greater gains over vLLM.</description>

      <title>Context-Augmented Code Generation Using Programming Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Code-LLMs (CLLMs) have significantly improved code generation, but, they frequently face difficulties when dealing with challenging and complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving and integrating external knowledge at the inference time. However, retrieval models often fail to find most relevant context, and generation models, with limited context capacity, can hallucinate when given irrelevant data. We present a novel framework that leverages a Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) to semantically represent and retrieve code. This approach enables fine-grained code retrieval by focusing on the most relevant segments while reducing irrelevant context through a tree-pruning technique. PKG is coupled with a re-ranking mechanism to reduce even more hallucinations by selectively integrating non-RAG solutions. We propose two retrieval approaches-block-wise and function-wise-based on the PKG, optimizing context granularity. Evaluations on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks show our method improves pass@1 accuracy by up to 20%, and outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 34% on MBPP. Our contributions include PKG-based retrieval, tree pruning to enhance retrieval precision, a re-ranking method for robust solution selection and a Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) enhancer module for automatic code augmentation with relevant comments and docstrings.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous RLHF: Faster and More Efficient Off-Policy RL for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model. To understand the challenges in this regime, we investigate a fundamental question: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we tested, we find that online DPO is most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. Finally, we verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task 40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance.</description>

      <title>Screw Geometry Meets Bandits: Incremental Acquisition of Demonstrations to Generate Manipulation Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of methodically obtaining a sufficient set of kinesthetic demonstrations, one at a time, such that a robot can be confident of its ability to perform a complex manipulation task in a given region of its workspace. Although Learning from Demonstrations has been an active area of research, the problems of checking whether a set of demonstrations is sufficient, and systematically seeking additional demonstrations have remained open. We present a novel approach to address these open problems using (i) a screw geometric representation to generate manipulation plans from demonstrations, which makes the sufficiency of a set of demonstrations measurable; (ii) a sampling strategy based on PAC-learning from multi-armed bandit optimization to evaluate the robot's ability to generate manipulation plans in a subregion of its task space; and (iii) a heuristic to seek additional demonstration from areas of weakness. Thus, we present an approach for the robot to incrementally and actively ask for new demonstration examples until the robot can assess with high confidence that it can perform the task successfully. We present experimental results on two example manipulation tasks, namely, pouring and scooping, to illustrate our approach. A short video on the method: https://youtu.be/R-qICICdEos</description>

      <title>Countering Autonomous Cyber Threats</title>

Abstract: With the capability to write convincing and fluent natural language and generate code, Foundation Models present dual-use concerns broadly and within the cyber domain specifically. Generative AI has already begun to impact cyberspace through a broad illicit marketplace for assisting malware development and social engineering attacks through hundreds of malicious-AI-as-a-services tools. More alarming is that recent research has shown the potential for these advanced models to inform or independently execute offensive cyberspace operations. However, these previous investigations primarily focused on the threats posed by proprietary models due to the until recent lack of strong open-weight model and additionally leave the impacts of network defenses or potential countermeasures unexplored. Critically, understanding the aptitude of downloadable models to function as offensive cyber agents is vital given that they are far more difficult to govern and prevent their misuse. As such, this work evaluates several state-of-the-art FMs on their ability to compromise machines in an isolated network and investigates defensive mechanisms to defeat such AI-powered attacks. Using target machines from a commercial provider, the most recently released downloadable models are found to be on par with a leading proprietary model at conducting simple cyber attacks with common hacking tools against known vulnerabilities. To mitigate such LLM-powered threats, defensive prompt injection (DPI) payloads for disrupting the malicious cyber agent's workflow are demonstrated to be effective. From these results, the implications for AI safety and governance with respect to cybersecurity is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series: A Review &amp; Critique of FITS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate time series forecasting is a highly valuable endeavour with applications across many industries. Despite recent deep learning advancements, increased model complexity, and larger model sizes, many state-of-the-art models often perform worse or on par with simpler models. One of those cases is a recently proposed model, FITS, claiming competitive performance with significantly reduced parameter counts. By training a one-layer neural network in the complex frequency domain, we are able to replicate these results. Our experiments on a wide range of real-world datasets further reveal that FITS especially excels at capturing periodic and seasonal patterns, but struggles with trending, non-periodic, or random-resembling behavior. With our two novel hybrid approaches, where we attempt to remedy the weaknesses of FITS by combining it with DLinear, we achieve the best results of any known open-source model on multivariate regression and promising results in multiple/linear regression on price datasets, on top of vastly improving upon what FITS achieves as a standalone model.</description>

      <title>Search-Based Path Planning among Movable Obstacles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Path planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO), which seeks a minimum cost collision-free path among static obstacles from start to goal while allowing the robot to push away movable obstacles (i.e., objects) along its path when needed. To develop planners that are complete and optimal for PAMO, the planner has to search a giant state space involving both the location of the robot as well as the locations of the objects, which grows exponentially with respect to the number of objects. The main idea in this paper is that, only a small fraction of this giant state space needs to be explored during planning as guided by a heuristic, and most of the objects far away from the robot are intact, which thus leads to runtime efficient algorithms. Based on this idea, this paper introduces two PAMO formulations, i.e., bi-objective and resource constrained problems in an occupancy grid, and develops PAMO*, a search method with completeness and solution optimality guarantees, to solve the two problems. We then further extend PAMO* to hybrid-state PAMO* to plan in continuous spaces with high-fidelity interaction between the robot and the objects. Our results show that, PAMO* can often find optimal solutions within a second in cluttered environments with up to 400 objects.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Creativity of LLMs in Proposing Novel Solutions to Mathematical Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mathematical capabilities of AI systems are complex and multifaceted. Most existing research has predominantly focused on the correctness of AI-generated solutions to mathematical problems. In this work, we argue that beyond producing correct answers, AI systems should also be capable of, or assist humans in, developing novel solutions to mathematical challenges. This study explores the creative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning, an aspect that has received limited attention in prior research. We introduce a novel framework and benchmark, CreativeMath, which encompasses problems ranging from middle school curricula to Olympic-level competitions, designed to assess LLMs' ability to propose innovative solutions after some known solutions have been provided. Our experiments demonstrate that, while LLMs perform well on standard mathematical tasks, their capacity for creative problem-solving varies considerably. Notably, the Gemini-1.5-Pro model outperformed other LLMs in generating novel solutions. This research opens a new frontier in evaluating AI creativity, shedding light on both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in fostering mathematical innovation, and setting the stage for future developments in AI-assisted mathematical discovery.</description>

      <title>Aggregated Knowledge Model: Enhancing Domain-Specific QA with Fine-Tuned and Retrieval-Augmented Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhancing closed-domain Question Answering (QA) systems, focusing on the specific needs of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL) Science Information Technology (ScienceIT) domain. Utilizing a rich dataset derived from the ScienceIT documentation, our study embarks on a detailed comparison of two fine-tuned large language models and five retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models. Through data processing techniques, we transform the documentation into structured context-question-answer triples, leveraging the latest Large Language Models (AWS Bedrock, GCP PaLM2, Meta LLaMA2, OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini-Pro) for data-driven insights. Additionally, we introduce the Aggregated Knowledge Model (AKM), which synthesizes responses from the seven models mentioned above using K-means clustering to select the most representative answers. The evaluation of these models across multiple metrics offers a comprehensive look into their effectiveness and suitability for the LBL ScienceIT environment. The results demonstrate the potential benefits of integrating fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented strategies, highlighting significant performance improvements achieved with the AKM. The insights gained from this study can be applied to develop specialized QA systems tailored to specific domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on the dynam-ics and performance of innovation teams during the idea generation phase of the innovation process. Utilizing a custom AI-augmented ideation tool, the study applies the Knowledge Spill-over Theory of Entrepreneurship to understand the effects of AI on knowledge spillover, gen-eration and application. Through a framed field experiment with participants divided into exper-imental and control groups, findings indicate that AI-augmented teams generated higher quali-ty ideas in less time. GenAI application led to improved efficiency, knowledge exchange, in-creased satisfaction and engagement as well as enhanced idea diversity. These results high-light the transformative role of the field of AI within the innovation management domain and shows that GenAI has a positive impact on important elements of the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepeneurship, emphasizing its potential impact on innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. Future research should further explore the dynamic interaction be-tween GenAI and creative processes.</description>

      <title>Data Publishing in Mechanics and Dynamics: Challenges, Guidelines, and Examples from Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-based methods have gained increasing importance in engineering, especially but not only driven by successes with deep artificial neural networks. Success stories are prevalent, e.g., in areas such as data-driven modeling, control and automation, as well as surrogate modeling for accelerated simulation. Beyond engineering, generative and large-language models are increasingly performing and helping with tasks that, previously, were solely associated with creative human processes. Thus, it seems timely to seek artificial-intelligence-support for engineering design tasks to automate, help with, or accelerate purpose-built designs of engineering systems, e.g., in mechanics and dynamics, where design so far requires a lot of specialized knowledge. However, research-wise, compared to established, predominantly first-principles-based methods, the datasets used for training, validation, and test become an almost inherent part of the overall methodology. Thus, data publishing becomes just as important in (data-driven) engineering science as appropriate descriptions of conventional methodology in publications in the past. This article analyzes the value and challenges of data publishing in mechanics and dynamics, in particular regarding engineering design tasks, showing that the latter raise also challenges and considerations not typical in fields where data-driven methods have been booming originally. Possible ways to deal with these challenges are discussed and a set of examples from across different design problems shows how data publishing can be put into practice. The analysis, discussions, and examples are based on the research experience made in a priority program of the German research foundation focusing on research on artificially intelligent design assistants in mechanics and dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Unimodal Speaker-Level Membership Inference Detector for Contrastive Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio can disclose PII, particularly when combined with related text data. Therefore, it is essential to develop tools to detect privacy leakage in Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining(CLAP). Existing MIAs need audio as input, risking exposure of voiceprint and requiring costly shadow models. To address these challenges, we propose USMID, a textual unimodal speaker-level membership inference detector for CLAP models, which queries the target model using only text data and does not require training shadow models. We randomly generate textual gibberish that are clearly not in training dataset. Then we extract feature vectors from these texts using the CLAP model and train a set of anomaly detectors on them. During inference, the feature vector of each test text is input into the anomaly detector to determine if the speaker is in the training set (anomalous) or not (normal). If available, USMID can further enhance detection by integrating real audio of the tested speaker. Extensive experiments on various CLAP model architectures and datasets demonstrate that USMID outperforms baseline methods using only text data.</description>

      <title>MoMQ: Mixture-of-Experts Enhances Multi-Dialect Query Generation across Relational and Non-Relational Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The improvement in translating natural language to structured query language (SQL) can be attributed to the advancements in large language models (LLMs). Open-source LLMs, tailored for specific database dialects such as MySQL, have shown great performance. However, cloud service providers are looking for a unified database manager service (e.g., Cosmos DB from Azure, Amazon Aurora from AWS, Lindorm from AlibabaCloud) that can support multiple dialects. This requirement has led to the concept of multi-dialect query generation, which presents challenges to LLMs. These challenges include syntactic differences among dialects and imbalanced data distribution across multiple dialects. To tackle these challenges, we propose MoMQ, a novel Mixture-of-Experts-based multi-dialect query generation framework across both relational and non-relational databases. MoMQ employs a dialect expert group for each dialect and a multi-level routing strategy to handle dialect-specific knowledge, reducing interference during query generation. Additionally, a shared expert group is introduced to address data imbalance, facilitating the transfer of common knowledge from high-resource dialects to low-resource ones. Furthermore, we have developed a high-quality multi-dialect query generation benchmark that covers relational and non-relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cypher for Neo4j, and nGQL for NebulaGraph. Extensive experiments have shown that MoMQ performs effectively and robustly even in resource-imbalanced scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Mathematical Modeling and Probabilistic Optimization Engineering in Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis on the mathematical problem formulations and the probabilistic optimization explorations for some of the key components in Transformer model [33] in the field of generative AI. We explore and discuss some potential further enhancement for current state of the art methods for some key underlying technologies of generative AI models from algorithmic and probabilistic optimization perspective. In particular, we present an optimal solution for sub-word encoding (SWE) based on similar initial settings as that of byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm in [9] with similar objectives as that of WordPiece approach in [28, 31] to maximize the likelihood of the training data. We also present cross entropy optimization method to optimize hyperparameters for word2vec model [17]. In addition, we propose a factored combination of rotary positional encoding (RoPE) [32] and attention with linear biases (ALiBi) [23] with a harmonic series. We also present a probabilistic FlashAttention [6, 7] (PrFlashAttention) method with a probability distribution over block distances in the matrix to decide which block is likely to participate in a given round of attention computation while maintaining the lower triangle shape of the tensor for autoregressive language models by re-shaping the tensors. Finally, we present staircase adaptive quantization (SAQ) of key-value (KV) cache for multi-query attention (MQA) based on the framework presented in [16] to have gradual quantization degradation while achieving reasonable model quality and cost savings.</description>

      <title>Verifying Non-friendly Formal Verification Designs: Can We Start Earlier?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of Systems on Chips (SoCs) is becoming more and more complex due to technological advancements. Missed bugs can cause drastic failures in safety-critical environments leading to the endangerment of lives. To overcome these drastic failures, formal property verification (FPV) has been applied in the industry. However, there exist multiple hardware designs where the results of FPV are not conclusive even for long runtimes of model-checking tools. For this reason, the use of High-level Equivalence Checking (HLEC) tools has been proposed in the last few years. However, the procedure for how to use it inside an industrial toolchain has not been defined. For this reason, we proposed an automated methodology based on metamodeling techniques which consist of two main steps. First, an untimed algorithmic description written in C++ is verified in an early stage using generated assertions; the advantage of this step is that the assertions at the software level run in seconds and we can start our analysis with conclusive results about our algorithm before starting to write the RTL (Register Transfer Level) design. Second, this algorithmic description is verified against its sequential design using HLEC and the respective metamodel parameters. The results show that the presented methodology can find bugs early related to the algorithmic description and prepare the setup for the HLEC verification. This helps to reduce the verification efforts to set up the tool and write the properties manually which is always error-prone. The proposed framework can help teams working on datapaths to verify and make decisions in an early stage of the verification flow.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Airway Segmentation in Lung CT Based on Multi-scale Nested Residual UNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and complete segmentation of airways in chest CT images is essential for the quantitative assessment of lung diseases and the facilitation of pulmonary interventional procedures. Although deep learning has led to significant advancements in medical image segmentation, maintaining airway continuity remains particularly challenging. This difficulty arises primarily from the small and dispersed nature of airway structures, as well as class imbalance in CT scans. To address these challenges, we designed a Multi-scale Nested Residual U-Net (MNR-UNet), incorporating multi-scale inputs and Residual Multi-scale Modules (RMM) into a nested residual framework to enhance information flow, effectively capturing the intricate details of small airways and mitigating gradient vanishing. Building on this, we developed a three-stage segmentation pipeline to optimize the training of the MNR-UNet. The first two stages prioritize high accuracy and sensitivity, while the third stage focuses on repairing airway breakages to balance topological completeness and correctness. To further address class imbalance, we introduced a weighted Breakage-Aware Loss (wBAL) to heighten focus on challenging samples, penalizing breakages and thereby extending the length of the airway tree. Additionally, we proposed a hierarchical evaluation framework to offer more clinically meaningful analysis. Validation on both in-house and public datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves superior performance in detecting more accurate airway voxels and identifying additional branches, significantly improving airway topological completeness. The code will be released publicly following the publication of the paper.</description>

      <title>Dialog2Flow: Pre-training Soft-Contrastive Action-Driven Sentence Embeddings for Automatic Dialog Flow Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently deriving structured workflows from unannotated dialogs remains an underexplored and formidable challenge in computational linguistics. Automating this process could significantly accelerate the manual design of workflows in new domains and enable the grounding of large language models in domain-specific flowcharts, enhancing transparency and controllability. In this paper, we introduce Dialog2Flow (D2F) embeddings, which differ from conventional sentence embeddings by mapping utterances to a latent space where they are grouped according to their communicative and informative functions (i.e., the actions they represent). D2F allows for modeling dialogs as continuous trajectories in a latent space with distinct action-related regions. By clustering D2F embeddings, the latent space is quantized, and dialogs can be converted into sequences of region/action IDs, facilitating the extraction of the underlying workflow. To pre-train D2F, we build a comprehensive dataset by unifying twenty task-oriented dialog datasets with normalized per-turn action annotations. We also introduce a novel soft contrastive loss that leverages the semantic information of these actions to guide the representation learning process, showing superior performance compared to standard supervised contrastive loss. Evaluation against various sentence embeddings, including dialog-specific ones, demonstrates that D2F yields superior qualitative and quantitative results across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Attention Neural Network Performance for Marijuana Consumption Classification through Large-scale Augmented Granger Causality (lsAGC) Analysis of Functional MR Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present research, the effectiveness of large-scale Augmented Granger Causality (lsAGC) as a tool for gauging brain network connectivity was examined to differentiate between marijuana users and typical controls by utilizing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The relationship between marijuana consumption and alterations in brain network connectivity is a recognized fact in scientific literature. This study probes how lsAGC can accurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension reduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts time-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of the inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset of 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain connections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification task, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize intricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for fMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a five-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the correlation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard deviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%, with a standard deviation of 1.44. The suggested method enhances the body of knowledge in the field of neuroimaging-based classification and emphasizes the necessity to consider directed causal connections in brain network connectivity analysis when studying marijuana's effects on the brain.</description>

      <title>KVSharer: Efficient Inference via Layer-Wise Dissimilar KV Cache Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly expanded model sizes, resulting in substantial GPU memory requirements during inference. The key and value storage of the attention map in the KV (key-value) cache accounts for more than 80\% of this memory consumption. Nowadays, most existing KV cache compression methods focus on intra-layer compression within a single Transformer layer but few works consider layer-wise compression. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play method called \textit{KVSharer}, which shares the KV cache between layers to achieve layer-wise compression. Rather than intuitively sharing based on higher similarity, we discover a counterintuitive phenomenon: sharing dissimilar KV caches better preserves the model performance. Experiments show that \textit{KVSharer} can reduce KV cache computation by 30\%, thereby lowering memory consumption without significantly impacting model performance and it can also achieve at least 1.3 times generation acceleration. Additionally, we verify that \textit{KVSharer} is compatible with existing intra-layer KV cache compression methods, and combining both can further save memory.</description>

      <title>LOGO -- Long cOntext aliGnment via efficient preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-context models(LCMs) have shown great potential in processing long input sequences(even more than 100M tokens) conveniently and effectively. With significant progress, recent research has pointed out that LCMs can accurately locate token-level salient information within the context. Yet, the generation performance of these LCMs is far from satisfactory and might result in misaligned responses, such as hallucinations. To enhance the generation capability of LCMs, existing works have investigated the effects of data size and quality for both pre-training and instruction tuning. Though achieving meaningful improvement, previous methods fall short in either effectiveness or efficiency. In this paper, we introduce LOGO(Long cOntext aliGnment via efficient preference Optimization), a training strategy that first introduces preference optimization for long-context alignment. To overcome the GPU memory-bound issue caused by the long sequence, LOGO employs a reference-free preference optimization strategy and adopts a position synthesis method to construct the training data. By training with only 0.3B data on a single 8$\times$A800 GPU machine for 16 hours, LOGO allows the Llama-3-8B-Instruct-80K model to achieve comparable performance with GPT-4 in real-world long-context tasks while preserving the model's original capabilities on other tasks, e.g., language modeling and MMLU. Moreover, LOGO can extend the model's context window size while enhancing its generation performance.</description>

      <title>On Explaining with Attention Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the much discussed, possible explanatory link between attention weights (AW) in transformer models and predicted output. Contrary to intuition and early research on attention, more recent prior research has provided formal arguments and empirical evidence that AW are not explanatorily relevant. We show that the formal arguments are incorrect. We introduce and effectively compute efficient attention, which isolates the effective components of attention matrices in tasks and models in which AW play an explanatory role. We show that efficient attention has a causal role (provides minimally necessary and sufficient conditions) for predicting model output in NLP tasks requiring contextual information, and we show, contrary to [7], that efficient attention matrices are probability distributions and are effectively calculable. Thus, they should play an important part in the explanation of attention based model behavior. We offer empirical experiments in support of our method illustrating various properties of efficient attention with various metrics on four datasets.</description>

      <title>IMAN: An Adaptive Network for Robust NPC Mortality Prediction with Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of mortality in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a complex malignancy particularly challenging in advanced stages, is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. However, this predictive process is often compromised by the high-dimensional and heterogeneous nature of NPC-related data, coupled with the pervasive issue of incomplete multi-modal data, manifesting as missing radiological images or incomplete diagnostic reports. Traditional machine learning approaches suffer significant performance degradation when faced with such incomplete data, as they fail to effectively handle the high-dimensionality and intricate correlations across modalities. Even advanced multi-modal learning techniques like Transformers struggle to maintain robust performance in the presence of missing modalities, as they lack specialized mechanisms to adaptively integrate and align the diverse data types, while also capturing nuanced patterns and contextual relationships within the complex NPC data. To address these problem, we introduce IMAN: an adaptive network for robust NPC mortality prediction with missing modalities.</description>

      <title>Complexity Matters: Effective Dimensionality as a Measure for Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying robustness in a single measure for the purposes of model selection, development of adversarial training methods, and anticipating trends has so far been elusive. The simplest metric to consider is the number of trainable parameters in a model but this has previously been shown to be insufficient at explaining robustness properties. A variety of other metrics, such as ones based on boundary thickness and gradient flatness have been proposed but have been shown to be inadequate proxies for robustness.
  In this work, we investigate the relationship between a model's effective dimensionality, which can be thought of as model complexity, and its robustness properties. We run experiments on commercial-scale models that are often used in real-world environments such as YOLO and ResNet. We reveal a near-linear inverse relationship between effective dimensionality and adversarial robustness, that is models with a lower dimensionality exhibit better robustness. We investigate the effect of a variety of adversarial training methods on effective dimensionality and find the same inverse linear relationship present, suggesting that effective dimensionality can serve as a useful criterion for model selection and robustness evaluation, providing a more nuanced and effective metric than parameter count or previously-tested measures.</description>

      <title>Bielik 7B v0.1: A Polish Language Model -- Development, Insights, and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Bielik 7B v0.1, a 7-billion-parameter generative text model for Polish language processing. Trained on curated Polish corpora, this model addresses key challenges in language model development through innovative techniques. These include Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss, which balances the learning of different instruction types, and Adaptive Learning Rate, which dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on training progress. To evaluate performance, we created the Open PL LLM Leaderboard and Polish MT-Bench, novel frameworks assessing various NLP tasks and conversational abilities. Bielik 7B v0.1 demonstrates significant improvements, achieving a 9 percentage point increase in average score compared to Mistral-7B-v0.1 on the RAG Reader task. It also excels in the Polish MT-Bench, particularly in Reasoning (6.15/10) and Role-playing (7.83/10) categories. This model represents a substantial advancement in Polish language AI, offering a powerful tool for diverse linguistic applications and setting new benchmarks in the field.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Object Navigation with Vision-Language Models Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object navigation is crucial for robots, but traditional methods require substantial training data and cannot be generalized to unknown environments. Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) aims to address this challenge, allowing robots to interact with unknown objects without specific training data. Language-driven zero-shot object navigation (L-ZSON) is an extension of ZSON that incorporates natural language instructions to guide robot navigation and interaction with objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision Language model with a Tree-of-thought Network (VLTNet) for L-ZSON. VLTNet comprises four main modules: vision language model understanding, semantic mapping, tree-of-thought reasoning and exploration, and goal identification. Among these modules, Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning and exploration module serves as a core component, innovatively using the ToT reasoning framework for navigation frontier selection during robot exploration. Compared to conventional frontier selection without reasoning, navigation using ToT reasoning involves multi-path reasoning processes and backtracking when necessary, enabling globally informed decision-making with higher accuracy. Experimental results on PASTURE and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model in LZSON, particularly in scenarios involving complex natural language as target instructions.</description>

      <title>Taipan: Efficient and Expressive State Space Language Models with Selective Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient long-context language modeling remains a significant challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While Transformers dominate language tasks, they struggle with long sequences due to quadratic computational complexity in training and linearly scaling memory costs during inference. Recent State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer alternatives with constant memory usage, but they underperform in tasks requiring extensive in-context retrieval. We introduce Taipan, a novel hybrid architecture that combines Mamba-2 with Selective Attention Layers (SALs). These SALs identify tokens requiring long-range interactions, remove less important features, and then augment their representations using the attention module. This approach balances Mamba's efficiency with Transformer-like performance in memory-intensive tasks. By constraining the attention budget, Taipan extends accurate predictions to context lengths of up to 1 million tokens while preserving computational efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate Taipan's superior performance across various scales and tasks, offering a promising solution for efficient long-context language modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech recognition and speech synthesis models are typically trained separately, each with its own set of learning objectives, training data, and model parameters, resulting in two distinct large networks. We propose a parameter-efficient approach to learning ASR and TTS jointly via a multi-task learning objective and shared parameters. Our evaluation demonstrates that the performance of our multi-task model is comparable to that of individually trained models while significantly saving computational and memory costs ($\sim$50\% reduction in the total number of parameters required for the two tasks combined). We experiment with English as a resource-rich language, and Arabic as a relatively low-resource language due to shortage of TTS data. Our models are trained with publicly available data, and both the training code and model checkpoints are openly available for further research.</description>

      <title>TripCast: Pre-training of Masked 2D Transformers for Trip Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning and pre-trained models have shown great success in time series forecasting. However, in the tourism industry, time series data often exhibit a leading time property, presenting a 2D structure. This introduces unique challenges for forecasting in this sector. In this study, we propose a novel modelling paradigm, TripCast, which treats trip time series as 2D data and learns representations through masking and reconstruction processes. Pre-trained on large-scale real-world data, TripCast notably outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in in-domain forecasting scenarios and demonstrates strong scalability and transferability in out-domain forecasting scenarios.</description>

      <title>FairQueue: Rethinking Prompt Learning for Fair Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has emerged as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fair text-to-image (T2I) generation. Specifically, this approach leverages readily available reference images to learn inclusive prompts for each target Sensitive Attribute (tSA), allowing for fair image generation. In this work, we first reveal that this prompt learning-based approach results in degraded sample quality. Our analysis shows that the approach's training objective -- which aims to align the embedding differences of learned prompts and reference images -- could be sub-optimal, resulting in distortion of the learned prompts and degraded generated images. To further substantiate this claim, as our major contribution, we deep dive into the denoising subnetwork of the T2I model to track down the effect of these learned prompts by analyzing the cross-attention maps. In our analysis, we propose a novel prompt switching analysis: I2H and H2I. Furthermore, we propose new quantitative characterization of cross-attention maps. Our analysis reveals abnormalities in the early denoising steps, perpetuating improper global structure that results in degradation in the generated samples. Building on insights from our analysis, we propose two ideas: (i) Prompt Queuing and (ii) Attention Amplification to address the quality issue. Extensive experimental results on a wide range of tSAs show that our proposed method outperforms SOTA approach's image generation quality, while achieving competitive fairness.

      <title>Prompting and Fine-Tuning of Small LLMs for Length-Controllable Telephone Call Summarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the rapid development of a telephone call summarization system utilizing large language models (LLMs). Our approach involves initial experiments with prompting existing LLMs to generate summaries of telephone conversations, followed by the creation of a tailored synthetic training dataset utilizing stronger frontier models. We place special focus on the diversity of the generated data and on the ability to control the length of the generated summaries to meet various use-case specific requirements. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated using two state-of-the-art LLM-as-a-judge-based evaluation techniques to ensure the quality and relevance of the summaries. Our results show that fine-tuned Llama-2-7B-based summarization model performs on-par with GPT-4 in terms of factual accuracy, completeness and conciseness. Our findings demonstrate the potential for quickly bootstrapping a practical and efficient call summarization system.</description>

      <title>SAMG: State-Action-Aware Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning with Offline Model Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The offline-to-online (O2O) paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL) utilizes pre-trained models on offline datasets for subsequent online fine-tuning. However, conventional O2O RL algorithms typically require maintaining and retraining the large offline datasets to mitigate the effects of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which limits their efficiency in exploiting online samples. To address this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm called SAMG: State-Action-Conditional Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning with Offline Model Guidance. In particular, rather than directly training on offline data, SAMG freezes the pre-trained offline critic to provide offline values for each state-action pair to deliver compact offline information. This framework eliminates the need for retraining with offline data by freezing and leveraging these values of the offline model. These are then incorporated with the online target critic using a Bellman equation weighted by a policy state-action-aware coefficient. This coefficient, derived from a conditional variational auto-encoder (C-VAE), aims to capture the reliability of the offline data on a state-action level. SAMG could be easily integrated with existing Q-function based O2O RL algorithms. Theoretical analysis shows good optimality and lower estimation error of SAMG. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SAMG outperforms four state-of-the-art O2O RL algorithms in the D4RL benchmark.</description>

      <title>Wavetable Synthesis Using CVAE for Timbre Control Based on Semantic Label</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizers are essential in modern music production. However, their complex timbre parameters, often filled with technical terms, require expertise. This research introduces a method of timbre control in wavetable synthesis that is intuitive and sensible and utilizes semantic labels. Using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), users can select a wavetable and define the timbre with labels such as bright, warm, and rich. The CVAE model, featuring convolutional and upsampling layers, effectively captures the wavetable nuances, ensuring real-time performance owing to their processing in the time domain. Experiments demonstrate that this approach allows for real-time, effective control of the timbre of the wavetable using semantic inputs and aims for intuitive timbre control through data-based semantic control.</description>

      <title>Little Giants: Synthesizing High-Quality Embedding Data at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation has become an increasingly popular way of training models without the need for large, manually labeled datasets. For tasks like text embedding, synthetic data offers diverse and scalable training examples, significantly reducing the cost of human annotation. However, most current approaches rely heavily on proprietary models like GPT-4, which are expensive and inefficient for generating large-scale embedding data. In this paper, we introduce SPEED, a framework that aligns open-source small models (8B) to efficiently generate large-scale synthetic embedding data. Through supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and self-improvement, SPEED enables small open-source models to produce high-quality data. Remarkably, SPEED uses only less than 1/10 of the GPT API calls, outperforming the state-of-the-art embedding model E5_mistral when both are trained solely on their synthetic data. Using this efficient generator, we conduct a comprehensive study on how various factors within the alignment pipeline impact data quality and reveal the scaling law for synthetic embedding data.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Attribution Score: Evaluating Training Data Influence in Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As diffusion models become increasingly popular, the misuse of copyrighted and private images has emerged as a major concern. One promising solution to mitigate this issue is identifying the contribution of specific training samples in generative models, a process known as data attribution. Existing data attribution methods for diffusion models typically quantify the contribution of a training sample by evaluating the change in diffusion loss when the sample is included or excluded from the training process. However, we argue that the direct usage of diffusion loss cannot represent such a contribution accurately due to the calculation of diffusion loss. Specifically, these approaches measure the divergence between predicted and ground truth distributions, which leads to an indirect comparison between the predicted distributions and cannot represent the variances between model behaviors. To address these issues, we aim to measure the direct comparison between predicted distributions with an attribution score to analyse the training sample importance, which is achieved by Diffusion Attribution Score (DAS). Underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis, we elucidate the effectiveness of DAS. Additionally, we explore strategies to accelerate DAS calculations, facilitating its application to large-scale diffusion models. Our extensive experiments across various datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that DAS significantly surpasses previous benchmarks in terms of the linear data-modelling score, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Smart ETL and LLM-based contents classification: the European Smart Tourism Tools Observatory experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Our research project focuses on improving the content update of the online European Smart Tourism Tools (STTs) Observatory by incorporating and categorizing STTs. The categorization is based on their taxonomy, and it facilitates the end user's search process. The use of a Smart ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process, where \emph{Smart} indicates the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is central to this endeavor.
  Methods: The contents describing STTs are derived from PDF catalogs, where PDF-scraping techniques extract QR codes, images, links, and text information. Duplicate STTs between the catalogs are removed, and the remaining ones are classified based on their text information using Large Language Models (LLMs). Finally, the data is transformed to comply with the Dublin Core metadata structure (the observatory's metadata structure), chosen for its wide acceptance and flexibility.
  Results: The Smart ETL process to import STTs to the observatory combines PDF-scraping techniques with LLMs for text content-based classification. Our preliminary results have demonstrated the potential of LLMs for text content-based classification.
  Conclusion: The proposed approach's feasibility is a step towards efficient content-based classification, not only in Smart Tourism but also adaptable to other fields. Future work will mainly focus on refining this classification process.</description>

      <title>$C^2$: Scalable Auto-Feedback for LLM-based Chart Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-quality charts with Large Language Models presents significant challenges due to limited data and the high cost of scaling through human curation. Instruction, data, and code triplets are scarce and expensive to manually curate as their creation demands technical expertise. To address this scalability issue, we introduce a reference-free automatic feedback generator, which eliminates the need for costly human intervention. Our novel framework, $C^2$, consists of (1) an automatic feedback provider (ChartAF) and (2) a diverse, reference-free dataset (ChartUIE-8K). Quantitative results are compelling: in our first experiment, 74% of respondents strongly preferred, and 10% preferred, the results after feedback. The second post-feedback experiment demonstrates that ChartAF outperforms nine baselines. Moreover, ChartUIE-8K significantly improves data diversity by increasing queries, datasets, and chart types by 5982%, 1936%, and 91%, respectively, over benchmarks. Finally, an LLM user study revealed that 94% of participants preferred ChartUIE-8K's queries, with 93% deeming them aligned with real-world use cases. Core contributions are available as open-source at an anonymized project site, with ample qualitative examples.</description>

      <title>Ali-AUG: Innovative Approaches to Labeled Data Augmentation using One-Step Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Ali-AUG, a novel single-step diffusion model for efficient labeled data augmentation in industrial applications. Our method addresses the challenge of limited labeled data by generating synthetic, labeled images with precise feature insertion. Ali-AUG utilizes a stable diffusion architecture enhanced with skip connections and LoRA modules to efficiently integrate masks and images, ensuring accurate feature placement without affecting unrelated image content. Experimental validation across various industrial datasets demonstrates Ali-AUG's superiority in generating high-quality, defect-enhanced images while maintaining rapid single-step inference. By offering precise control over feature insertion and minimizing required training steps, our technique significantly enhances data augmentation capabilities, providing a powerful tool for improving the performance of deep learning models in scenarios with limited labeled data. Ali-AUG is especially useful for use cases like defective product image generation to train AI-based models to improve their ability to detect defects in manufacturing processes. Using different data preparation strategies, including Classification Accuracy Score (CAS) and Naive Augmentation Score (NAS), we show that Ali-AUG improves model performance by 31% compared to other augmentation methods and by 45% compared to models without data augmentation. Notably, Ali-AUG reduces training time by 32% and supports both paired and unpaired datasets, enhancing flexibility in data preparation.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Reasoning Capability of LLMs via Scalable Question Synthesis from Scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of high-quality data is one of the most important factors in improving the reasoning capability of LLMs. Existing works have demonstrated the effectiveness of creating more instruction data from seed questions or knowledge bases. Recent research indicates that continually scaling up data synthesis from strong models (e.g., GPT-4) can further elicit reasoning performance. Though promising, the open-sourced community still lacks high-quality data at scale and scalable data synthesis methods with affordable costs. To address this, we introduce ScaleQuest, a scalable and novel data synthesis method that utilizes "small-size" (e.g., 7B) open-source models to generate questions from scratch without the need for seed data with complex augmentation constraints. With the efficient ScaleQuest, we automatically constructed a mathematical reasoning dataset consisting of 1 million problem-solution pairs, which are more effective than existing open-sourced datasets. It can universally increase the performance of mainstream open-source models (i.e., Mistral, Llama3, DeepSeekMath, and Qwen2-Math) by achieving 29.2% to 46.4% gains on MATH. Notably, simply fine-tuning the Qwen2-Math-7B-Base model with our dataset can even surpass Qwen2-Math-7B-Instruct, a strong and well-aligned model on closed-source data, and proprietary models such as GPT-4-Turbo and Claude-3.5 Sonnet.</description>

      <title>How Good Are LLMs for Literary Translation, Really? Literary Translation Evaluation with Humans and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has focused on literary machine translation (MT) as a new challenge in MT. However, the evaluation of literary MT remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing discussion by introducing LITEVAL-CORPUS, a paragraph-level parallel corpus comprising multiple verified human translations and outputs from 9 MT systems, which totals over 2k paragraphs and includes 13k annotated sentences across four language pairs, costing 4.5k Euro. This corpus enables us to (i) examine the consistency and adequacy of multiple annotation schemes, (ii) compare evaluations by students and professionals, and (iii) assess the effectiveness of LLM-based metrics. We find that Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM), as the de facto standard in non-literary human MT evaluation, is inadequate for literary translation: While Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) with students and Scalar Quality Metric (SQM) with professional translators prefer human translations at rates of ~82% and ~94%, respectively, MQM with student annotators prefers human professional translations over the translations of the best-performing LLMs in only ~42% of cases. While automatic metrics generally show a moderate correlation with human MQM and SQM, they struggle to accurately identify human translations, with rates of at most ~20%. Our overall evaluation indicates that human professional translations consistently outperform LLM translations, where even the most recent LLMs tend to produce more literal and less diverse translations compared to human translations. However, newer LLMs such as GPT-4o perform substantially better than older ones.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Genetic Basis of Glioblastoma Heterogeneity through Multimodal Analysis of Whole Slide Images and RNA Sequencing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer characterized by rapid progression and poor prognosis. Despite advances in treatment, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving this aggressiveness remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed multimodal deep learning approaches to investigate glioblastoma heterogeneity using joint image/RNA-seq analysis. Our results reveal novel genes associated with glioblastoma. By leveraging a combination of whole-slide images and RNA-seq, as well as introducing novel methods to encode RNA-seq data, we identified specific genetic profiles that may explain different patterns of glioblastoma progression. These findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying glioblastoma heterogeneity and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</description>

      <title>Low-Latency Video Anonymization for Crowd Anomaly Detection: Privacy vs. Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence promise ample potential in monitoring applications with surveillance cameras. However, concerns about privacy and model bias have made it challenging to utilize them in public. Although de-identification approaches have been proposed in the literature, aiming to achieve a certain level of anonymization, most of them employ deep learning models that are computationally demanding for real-time edge deployment. In this study, we revisit conventional anonymization solutions for privacy protection and real-time video anomaly detection (VAD) applications. We propose a novel lightweight adaptive anonymization for VAD (LA3D) that employs dynamic adjustment to enhance privacy protection. We evaluated the approaches on publicly available privacy and VAD data sets to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the different anonymization techniques and highlight the promising efficacy of our approach. Our experiment demonstrates that LA3D enables substantial improvement in the privacy anonymization capability without majorly degrading VAD efficacy.</description>

      <title>GeoLoRA: Geometric integration for parameter efficient fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large-scale, pre-trained neural networks. However, LoRA and its extensions face several challenges, including the need for rank adaptivity, robustness, and computational efficiency during the fine-tuning process. We introduce GeoLoRA, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging dynamical low-rank approximation theory. GeoLoRA requires only a single backpropagation pass over the small-rank adapters, significantly reducing computational cost as compared to similar dynamical low-rank training methods and making it faster than popular baselines such as AdaLoRA. This allows GeoLoRA to efficiently adapt the allocated parameter budget across the model, achieving smaller low-rank adapters compared to heuristic methods like AdaLoRA and LoRA, while maintaining critical convergence, descent, and error-bound theoretical guarantees. The resulting method is not only more efficient but also more robust to varying hyperparameter settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoLoRA on several state-of-the-art benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Does Differential Privacy Impact Bias in Pretrained NLP Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is applied when fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to limit leakage of training examples. While most DP research has focused on improving a model's privacy-utility tradeoff, some find that DP can be unfair to or biased against underrepresented groups. In this work, we show the impact of DP on bias in LLMs through empirical analysis. Differentially private training can increase the model bias against protected groups w.r.t AUC-based bias metrics. DP makes it more difficult for the model to differentiate between the positive and negative examples from the protected groups and other groups in the rest of the population. Our results also show that the impact of DP on bias is not only affected by the privacy protection level but also the underlying distribution of the dataset.</description>

      <title>Robust Watermarking Using Generative Priors Against Image Editing: From Benchmarking to Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current image watermarking methods are vulnerable to advanced image editing techniques enabled by large-scale text-to-image models. These models can distort embedded watermarks during editing, posing significant challenges to copyright protection. In this work, we introduce W-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of watermarking methods against a wide range of image editing techniques, including image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation. Through extensive evaluations of eleven representative watermarking methods against prevalent editing techniques, we demonstrate that most methods fail to detect watermarks after such edits. To address this limitation, we propose VINE, a watermarking method that significantly enhances robustness against various image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. Our approach involves two key innovations: (1) we analyze the frequency characteristics of image editing and identify that blurring distortions exhibit similar frequency properties, which allows us to use them as surrogate attacks during training to bolster watermark robustness; (2) we leverage a large-scale pretrained diffusion model SDXL-Turbo, adapting it for the watermarking task to achieve more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that our method achieves outstanding watermarking performance under various image editing techniques, outperforming existing methods in both image quality and robustness.

      <title>Towards Visual Text Design Transfer Across Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual text design plays a critical role in conveying themes, emotions, and atmospheres in multimodal formats such as film posters and album covers. Translating these visual and textual elements across languages extends the concept of translation beyond mere text, requiring the adaptation of aesthetic and stylistic features. To address this, we introduce a novel task of Multimodal Style Translation (MuST-Bench), a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of visual text generation models to perform translation across different writing systems while preserving design intent. Our initial experiments on MuST-Bench reveal that existing visual text generation models struggle with the proposed task due to the inadequacy of textual descriptions in conveying visual design. In response, we introduce SIGIL, a framework for multimodal style translation that eliminates the need for style descriptions. SIGIL enhances image generation models through three innovations: glyph latent for multilingual settings, pretrained VAEs for stable style guidance, and an OCR model with reinforcement learning feedback for optimizing readable character generation. SIGIL outperforms existing baselines by achieving superior style consistency and legibility while maintaining visual fidelity, setting itself apart from traditional description-based approaches. We release MuST-Bench publicly for broader use and exploration https://huggingface.co/datasets/yejinc/MuST-Bench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic cost-effective approach to developing bilingual base large language models (LLMs) to support English and any target language. The method includes vocabulary expansion, initialization of new embeddings, model training and evaluation. We performed our experiments with three languages, each using a non-Latin script - Ukrainian, Arabic, and Georgian.
  Our approach demonstrates improved language performance while reducing computational costs. It mitigates the disproportionate penalization of underrepresented languages, promoting fairness and minimizing adverse phenomena such as code-switching and broken grammar. Additionally, we introduce new metrics to evaluate language quality, revealing that vocabulary size significantly impacts the quality of generated text.</description>

      <title>From Efficiency to Equity: Measuring Fairness in Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems, particularly generative models, increasingly influence decision-making, ensuring that they are able to fairly represent diverse human preferences becomes crucial. This paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating epistemic fairness in preference learning models inspired by economic theories of inequality and Rawlsian justice. We propose metrics adapted from the Gini Coefficient, Atkinson Index, and Kuznets Ratio to quantify fairness in these models. We validate our approach using two datasets: a custom visual preference dataset (AI-EDI-Space) and the Jester Jokes dataset. Our analysis reveals variations in model performance across users, highlighting potential epistemic injustices. We explore pre-processing and in-processing techniques to mitigate these inequalities, demonstrating a complex relationship between model efficiency and fairness. This work contributes to AI ethics by providing a framework for evaluating and improving epistemic fairness in preference learning models, offering insights for developing more inclusive AI systems in contexts where diverse human preferences are crucial.</description>

      <title>Learning to Explore with Lagrangians for Bandits under Unknown Linear Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure exploration in bandits models multiple real-world problems, such as tuning hyper-parameters or conducting user studies, where different safety, resource, and fairness constraints on the decision space naturally appear. We study these problems as pure exploration in multi-armed bandits with unknown linear constraints, where the aim is to identify an $r$$\textit{-good feasible policy}$. First, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation of the sample complexity lower bound for pure exploration under constraints. We show how this lower bound evolves with the sequential estimation of constraints. Second, we leverage the Lagrangian lower bound and the properties of convex optimisation to propose two computationally efficient extensions of Track-and-Stop and Gamified Explorer, namely LATS and LAGEX. To this end, we propose a constraint-adaptive stopping rule, and while tracking the lower bound, use pessimistic estimate of the feasible set at each step. We show that these algorithms achieve asymptotically optimal sample complexity upper bounds up to constraint-dependent constants. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments with different reward distributions and constraints that validate efficient performance of LAGEX and LATS with respect to baselines.</description>

      <title>Expanding AI Awareness Through Everyday Interactions with AI: A Reflective Journal Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the application of AI continues to expand, students in technology programs are poised to be both producers and users of the technologies. They are also positioned to engage with AI applications within and outside the classroom. While focusing on the curriculum when examining students' AI knowledge is common, extending this connection to students' everyday interactions with AI provides a more complete picture of their learning. In this paper, we explore student's awareness and engagement with AI in the context of school and their daily lives. Over six weeks, 22 undergraduate students participated in a reflective journal study and submitted a weekly journal entry about their interactions with AI. The participants were recruited from a technology and society course that focuses on the implications of technology on people, communities, and processes. In their weekly journal entries, participants reflected on interactions with AI on campus (coursework, advertises campus events, or seminars) and beyond (social media, news, or conversations with friends and family). The journal prompts were designed to help them think through what they had read, watched, or been told and reflect on the development of their own perspectives, knowledge, and literacy on the topic. Overall, students described nine categories of interactions: coursework, news and current events, using software and applications, university events, social media related to their work, personal discussions with friends and family, interacting with content, and gaming. Students reported that completing the diaries allowed them time for reflection and made them more aware of the presence of AI in their daily lives and of its potential benefits and drawbacks. This research contributes to the ongoing work on AI awareness and literacy by bringing in perspectives from beyond a formal educational context.</description>

      <title>DL-Polycube: Deep learning enhanced polycube method for high-quality hexahedral mesh generation and volumetric spline construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that integrates deep learning with the polycube method (DL-Polycube) to generate high-quality hexahedral (hex) meshes, which are then used to construct volumetric splines for isogeometric analysis. Our DL-Polycube algorithm begins by establishing a connection between surface triangular meshes and polycube structures. We employ deep neural network to classify surface triangular meshes into their corresponding polycube structures. Following this, we combine the acquired polycube structural information with unsupervised learning to perform surface segmentation of triangular meshes. This step addresses the issue of segmentation not corresponding to a polycube while reducing manual intervention. Quality hex meshes are then generated from the polycube structures, with employing octree subdivision, parametric mapping and quality improvement techniques. The incorporation of deep learning for creating polycube structures, combined with unsupervised learning for segmentation of surface triangular meshes, substantially accelerates hex mesh generation. Finally, truncated hierarchical B-splines are constructed on the generated hex meshes. We extract trivariate B\'ezier elements from these splines and apply them directly in isogeometric analysis. We offer several examples to demonstrate the robustness of our DL-Polycube algorithm.</description>

      <title>DeCoRe: Decoding by Contrasting Retrieval Heads to Mitigate Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, producing unfaithful or factually incorrect outputs by misrepresenting the provided context or incorrectly recalling internal knowledge. Recent studies have identified specific attention heads within the Transformer architecture, known as retrieval heads, responsible for extracting relevant contextual information. We hypothesise that masking these retrieval heads can induce hallucinations and that contrasting the outputs of the base LLM and the masked LLM can reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Decoding by Contrasting Retrieval Heads (DeCoRe), a novel training-free decoding strategy that amplifies information found in the context and model parameters. DeCoRe mitigates potentially hallucinated responses by dynamically contrasting the outputs of the base LLM and the masked LLM, using conditional entropy as a guide. Our extensive experiments confirm that DeCoRe significantly improves performance on tasks requiring high contextual faithfulness, such as summarisation (XSum by 18.6%), instruction following (MemoTrap by 10.9%), and open-book question answering (NQ-Open by 2.4% and NQ-Swap by 5.5%).</description>

      <title>Provably Robust Watermarks for Open-Source Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent explosion of high-quality language models has necessitated new methods for identifying AI-generated text. Watermarking is a leading solution and could prove to be an essential tool in the age of generative AI. Existing approaches embed watermarks at inference and crucially rely on the large language model (LLM) specification and parameters being secret, which makes them inapplicable to the open-source setting. In this work, we introduce the first watermarking scheme for open-source LLMs. Our scheme works by modifying the parameters of the model, but the watermark can be detected from just the outputs of the model. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that our watermarks are unremovable under certain assumptions about the adversary's knowledge. To demonstrate the behavior of our construction under concrete parameter instantiations, we present experimental results with OPT-6.7B and OPT-1.3B. We demonstrate robustness to both token substitution and perturbation of the model parameters. We find that the stronger of these attacks, the model-perturbation attack, requires deteriorating the quality score to 0 out of 100 in order to bring the detection rate down to 50%.</description>

      <title>Diff-Instruct++: Training One-step Text-to-image Generator Model to Align with Human Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-step text-to-image generator models offer advantages such as swift inference efficiency, flexible architectures, and state-of-the-art generation performance. In this paper, we study the problem of aligning one-step generator models with human preferences for the first time. Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), we formulate the alignment problem as maximizing expected human reward functions while adding an Integral Kullback-Leibler divergence term to prevent the generator from diverging. By overcoming technical challenges, we introduce Diff-Instruct++ (DI++), the first, fast-converging and image data-free human preference alignment method for one-step text-to-image generators. We also introduce novel theoretical insights, showing that using CFG for diffusion distillation is secretly doing RLHF with DI++. Such an interesting finding brings understanding and potential contributions to future research involving CFG. In the experiment sections, we align both UNet-based and DiT-based one-step generators using DI++, which use the Stable Diffusion 1.5 and the PixelArt-$\alpha$ as the reference diffusion processes. The resulting DiT-based one-step text-to-image model achieves a strong Aesthetic Score of 6.19 and an Image Reward of 1.24 on the COCO validation prompt dataset. It also achieves a leading Human preference Score (HPSv2.0) of 28.48, outperforming other open-sourced models such as Stable Diffusion XL, DMD2, SD-Turbo, as well as PixelArt-$\alpha$. Both theoretical contributions and empirical evidence indicate that DI++ is a strong human-preference alignment approach for one-step text-to-image models.</description>

      <title>Creating and Repairing Robot Programs in Open-World Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce robot programs from natural language has allowed for robot systems that can complete a higher diversity of tasks. However, LLM-generated programs may be faulty, either due to ambiguity in instructions, misinterpretation of the desired task, or missing information about the world state. As these programs run, the state of the world changes and they gather new information. When a failure occurs, it is important that they recover from the current world state and avoid repeating steps that they they previously completed successfully. We propose RoboRepair, a system which traces the execution of a program up until error, and then runs an LLM-produced recovery program that minimizes repeated actions.
  To evaluate the efficacy of our system, we create a benchmark consisting of eleven tasks with various error conditions that require the generation of a recovery program. We compare the efficiency of the recovery program to a plan built with an oracle that has foreknowledge of future errors.</description>

      <title>PRISM: A Methodology for Auditing Biases in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auditing Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover their biases and preferences is an emerging challenge in creating Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI). While various methods have been proposed to elicit the preferences of such models, countermeasures have been taken by LLM trainers, such that LLMs hide, obfuscate or point blank refuse to disclosure their positions on certain subjects. This paper presents PRISM, a flexible, inquiry-based methodology for auditing LLMs - that seeks to illicit such positions indirectly through task-based inquiry prompting rather than direct inquiry of said preferences. To demonstrate the utility of the methodology, we applied PRISM on the Political Compass Test, where we assessed the political leanings of twenty-one LLMs from seven providers. We show LLMs, by default, espouse positions that are economically left and socially liberal (consistent with prior work). We also show the space of positions that these models are willing to espouse - where some models are more constrained and less compliant than others - while others are more neutral and objective. In sum, PRISM can more reliably probe and audit LLMs to understand their preferences, biases and constraints.</description>

      <title>SkillMimicGen: Automated Demonstration Generation for Efficient Skill Learning and Deployment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective paradigm for robot manipulation, but acquiring large datasets is costly and resource-intensive, especially for long-horizon tasks. To address this issue, we propose SkillMimicGen (SkillGen), an automated system for generating demonstration datasets from a few human demos. SkillGen segments human demos into manipulation skills, adapts these skills to new contexts, and stitches them together through free-space transit and transfer motion. We also propose a Hybrid Skill Policy (HSP) framework for learning skill initiation, control, and termination components from SkillGen datasets, enabling skills to be sequenced using motion planning at test-time. We demonstrate that SkillGen greatly improves data generation and policy learning performance over a state-of-the-art data generation framework, resulting in the capability to produce data for large scene variations, including clutter, and agents that are on average 24% more successful. We demonstrate the efficacy of SkillGen by generating over 24K demonstrations across 18 task variants in simulation from just 60 human demonstrations, and training proficient, often near-perfect, HSP agents. Finally, we apply SkillGen to 3 real-world manipulation tasks and also demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a long-horizon assembly task.

      <title>Dynamic 3D Gaussian Tracking for Graph-Based Neural Dynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Videos of robots interacting with objects encode rich information about the objects' dynamics. However, existing video prediction approaches typically do not explicitly account for the 3D information from videos, such as robot actions and objects' 3D states, limiting their use in real-world robotic applications. In this work, we introduce a framework to learn object dynamics directly from multi-view RGB videos by explicitly considering the robot's action trajectories and their effects on scene dynamics. We utilize the 3D Gaussian representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to train a particle-based dynamics model using Graph Neural Networks. This model operates on sparse control particles downsampled from the densely tracked 3D Gaussian reconstructions. By learning the neural dynamics model on offline robot interaction data, our method can predict object motions under varying initial configurations and unseen robot actions. The 3D transformations of Gaussians can be interpolated from the motions of control particles, enabling the rendering of predicted future object states and achieving action-conditioned video prediction. The dynamics model can also be applied to model-based planning frameworks for object manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments on various kinds of deformable materials, including ropes, clothes, and stuffed animals, demonstrating our framework's ability to model complex shapes and dynamics.

      <title>From Blind Solvers to Logical Thinkers: Benchmarking LLMs' Logical Integrity on Faulty Mathematical Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the math problem: "Lily received 3 cookies from her best friend yesterday and ate 5 for breakfast. Today, her friend gave her 3 more cookies. How many cookies does Lily have now?" Many large language models (LLMs) in previous research approach this problem by calculating the answer "1" using the equation "3 - 5 + 3." However, from a human perspective, we recognize the inherent flaw in this problem: Lily cannot eat 5 cookies if she initially only had 3. This discrepancy prompts a key question: Are current LLMs merely Blind Solver that apply mathematical operations without deeper reasoning, or can they function as Logical Thinker capable of identifying logical inconsistencies?
  To explore this question, we propose a benchmark dataset, FaultyMath, which includes faulty math problems of rich diversity: i) multiple mathematical categories, e.g., algebra, geometry, number theory, etc., ii) varying levels of difficulty, and iii) different origins of faultiness -- ranging from violations of common sense and ambiguous statements to mathematical contradictions and more. We evaluate a broad spectrum of LLMs, including open-source, closed-source, and math-specialized models, using FaultyMath across three dimensions: (i) How accurately can the models detect faulty math problems without being explicitly prompted to do so? (ii) When provided with hints -- either correct or misleading -- about the validity of the problems, to what extent do LLMs adapt to become reliable Logical Thinker? (iii) How trustworthy are the explanations generated by LLMs when they recognize a math problem as flawed? Through extensive experimentation and detailed analysis, our results demonstrate that existing LLMs largely function as Blind Solver and fall short of the reasoning capabilities required to perform as Logical Thinker.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SegLLM, a novel multi-round interactive reasoning segmentation model that enhances LLM-based segmentation by exploiting conversational memory of both visual and textual outputs. By leveraging a mask-aware multimodal LLM, SegLLM re-integrates previous segmentation results into its input stream, enabling it to reason about complex user intentions and segment objects in relation to previously identified entities, including positional, interactional, and hierarchical relationships, across multiple interactions. This capability allows SegLLM to respond to visual and text queries in a chat-like manner. Evaluated on the newly curated MRSeg benchmark, SegLLM outperforms existing methods in multi-round interactive reasoning segmentation by over 20%. Additionally, we observed that training on multi-round reasoning segmentation data enhances performance on standard single-round referring segmentation and localization tasks, resulting in a 5.5% increase in cIoU for referring expression segmentation and a 4.5% improvement in Acc@0.5 for referring expression localization.</description>

      <title>ANAVI: Audio Noise Awareness using Visuals of Indoor environments for NAVIgation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Audio Noise Awareness using Visuals of Indoors for NAVIgation for quieter robot path planning. While humans are naturally aware of the noise they make and its impact on those around them, robots currently lack this awareness. A key challenge in achieving audio awareness for robots is estimating how loud will the robot's actions be at a listener's location? Since sound depends upon the geometry and material composition of rooms, we train the robot to passively perceive loudness using visual observations of indoor environments. To this end, we generate data on how loud an 'impulse' sounds at different listener locations in simulated homes, and train our Acoustic Noise Predictor (ANP). Next, we collect acoustic profiles corresponding to different actions for navigation. Unifying ANP with action acoustics, we demonstrate experiments with wheeled (Hello Robot Stretch) and legged (Unitree Go2) robots so that these robots adhere to the noise constraints of the environment.

      <title>Dynamic Vocabulary Pruning in Early-Exit LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing the size of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to lead to better performance. However, this comes at the cost of slower and more expensive inference. Early-exiting is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of LLM inference by enabling next token prediction at intermediate layers. Yet, the large vocabulary size in modern LLMs makes the confidence estimation required for exit decisions computationally expensive, diminishing the efficiency gains. To address this, we propose dynamically pruning the vocabulary at test time for each token. Specifically, the vocabulary is pruned at one of the initial layers, and the smaller vocabulary is then used throughout the rest of the forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that such post-hoc dynamic vocabulary pruning improves the efficiency of confidence estimation in early-exit LLMs while maintaining competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Context is Key: A Benchmark for Forecasting with Essential Textual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting is a critical task in decision making across various domains. While numerical data provides a foundation, it often lacks crucial context necessary for accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge or constraints, which can be efficiently communicated through natural language. However, the ability of existing forecasting models to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. By presenting this benchmark, we aim to advance multimodal forecasting, promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise. The benchmark can be visualized at https://servicenow.github.io/context-is-key-forecasting/v0/ .</description>

      <title>Deep Insights into Cognitive Decline: A Survey of Leveraging Non-Intrusive Modalities with Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive decline is a natural part of aging, often resulting in reduced cognitive abilities. In some cases, however, this decline is more pronounced, typically due to disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Early detection of anomalous cognitive decline is crucial, as it can facilitate timely professional intervention. While medical data can help in this detection, it often involves invasive procedures. An alternative approach is to employ non-intrusive techniques such as speech or handwriting analysis, which do not necessarily affect daily activities. This survey reviews the most relevant methodologies that use deep learning techniques to automate the cognitive decline estimation task, including audio, text, and visual processing. We discuss the key features and advantages of each modality and methodology, including state-of-the-art approaches like Transformer architecture and foundation models. In addition, we present works that integrate different modalities to develop multimodal models. We also highlight the most significant datasets and the quantitative results from studies using these resources. From this review, several conclusions emerge. In most cases, the textual modality achieves the best results and is the most relevant for detecting cognitive decline. Moreover, combining various approaches from individual modalities into a multimodal model consistently enhances performance across nearly all scenarios.</description>

      <title>3D-Adapter: Geometry-Consistent Multi-View Diffusion for High-Quality 3D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-view image diffusion models have significantly advanced open-domain 3D object generation. However, most existing models rely on 2D network architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase the broad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results in text-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.</description>

      <title>Unbounded: A Generative Infinite Game of Character Life Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a generative infinite game, a video game that transcends the traditional boundaries of finite, hard-coded systems by using generative models. Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite and infinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to create Unbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.</description>

      <title>CAMEL-Bench: A Comprehensive Arabic LMM Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a significant interest in developing large multimodal models (LMMs) capable of performing various visual reasoning and understanding tasks. This has led to the introduction of multiple LMM benchmarks to evaluate LMMs on different tasks. However, most existing LMM evaluation benchmarks are predominantly English-centric. In this work, we develop a comprehensive LMM evaluation benchmark for the Arabic language to represent a large population of over 400 million speakers. The proposed benchmark, named CAMEL-Bench, comprises eight diverse domains and 38 sub-domains including, multi-image understanding, complex visual perception, handwritten document understanding, video understanding, medical imaging, plant diseases, and remote sensing-based land use understanding to evaluate broad scenario generalizability. Our CAMEL-Bench comprises around 29,036 questions that are filtered from a larger pool of samples, where the quality is manually verified by native speakers to ensure reliable model assessment. We conduct evaluations of both closed-source, including GPT-4 series, and open-source LMMs. Our analysis reveals the need for substantial improvement, especially among the best open-source models, with even the closed-source GPT-4o achieving an overall score of 62%. Our benchmark and evaluation scripts are open-sourced.</description>

      <title>PixelGaussian: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Reconstruction from Arbitrary Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose PixelGaussian, an efficient feed-forward framework for learning generalizable 3D Gaussian reconstruction from arbitrary views. Most existing methods rely on uniform pixel-wise Gaussian representations, which learn a fixed number of 3D Gaussians for each view and cannot generalize well to more input views. Differently, our PixelGaussian dynamically adapts both the Gaussian distribution and quantity based on geometric complexity, leading to more efficient representations and significant improvements in reconstruction quality. Specifically, we introduce a Cascade Gaussian Adapter to adjust Gaussian distribution according to local geometry complexity identified by a keypoint scorer. CGA leverages deformable attention in context-aware hypernetworks to guide Gaussian pruning and splitting, ensuring accurate representation in complex regions while reducing redundancy. Furthermore, we design a transformer-based Iterative Gaussian Refiner module that refines Gaussian representations through direct image-Gaussian interactions. Our PixelGaussian can effectively reduce Gaussian redundancy as input views increase. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale ACID and RealEstate10K datasets, where our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with good generalization to various numbers of views.

Abstract: Tables, typically two-dimensional and structured to store large amounts of data, are essential in daily activities like database queries, spreadsheet manipulations, web table question answering, and image table information extraction. Automating these table-centric tasks with Large Language Models (LLMs) or Visual Language Models (VLMs) offers significant public benefits, garnering interest from academia and industry. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of table-related tasks, examining both user scenarios and technical aspects. It covers traditional tasks like table question answering as well as emerging fields such as spreadsheet manipulation and table data analysis. We summarize the training techniques for LLMs and VLMs tailored for table processing. Additionally, we discuss prompt engineering, particularly the use of LLM-powered agents, for various table-related tasks. Finally, we highlight several challenges, including diverse user input when serving and slow thinking using chain-of-thought.</description>

      <title>A Review of Prominent Paradigms for LLM-Based Agents: Tool Use (Including RAG), Planning, and Feedback Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05804v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tool use, planning, and feedback learning are currently three prominent paradigms for developing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents across various tasks. Although numerous frameworks have been devised for each paradigm, their intricate workflows and inconsistent taxonomy create challenges in understanding and reviewing the frameworks across different paradigms. This survey introduces a unified taxonomy to systematically review and discuss these frameworks. Specifically, 1) the taxonomy defines environments/tasks, common LLM-profiled roles or LMPRs (policy models, evaluators, and dynamic models), and universally applicable workflows found in prior work, and 2) it enables a comparison of key perspectives on the implementations of LMPRs and workflow designs across different agent paradigms and frameworks. 3) Finally, we identify three limitations in existing workflow designs and systematically discuss the future work. Resources have been made publicly available at in our GitHub repository https://github.com/xinzhel/LLM-Agent-Survey.</description>

      <title>Neural Concept Binder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge in object-based visual reasoning lies in generating concept representations that are both descriptive and distinct. Achieving this in an unsupervised manner requires human users to understand the model's learned concepts and, if necessary, revise incorrect ones. To address this challenge, we introduce the Neural Concept Binder (NCB), a novel framework for deriving both discrete and continuous concept representations, which we refer to as "concept-slot encodings". NCB employs two types of binding: "soft binding", which leverages the recent SysBinder mechanism to obtain object-factor encodings, and subsequent "hard binding", achieved through hierarchical clustering and retrieval-based inference. This enables obtaining expressive, discrete representations from unlabeled images. Moreover, the structured nature of NCB's concept representations allows for intuitive inspection and the straightforward integration of external knowledge, such as human input or insights from other AI models like GPT-4. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the hard binding mechanism preserves model performance while enabling seamless integration into both neural and symbolic modules for complex reasoning tasks. We validate the effectiveness of NCB through evaluations on our newly introduced CLEVR-Sudoku dataset.</description>

      <title>A Training Data Recipe to Accelerate A* Search with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search algorithms like A* holds the promise of enhanced LLM reasoning and scalable inference. To accelerate training and reduce computational demands, we investigate the coreset selection problem for the training data of LLM heuristic learning. Few methods to learn the heuristic functions consider the interaction between the search algorithm and the machine learning model. In this work, we empirically disentangle the requirements of A* search algorithm from the requirements of the LLM to generalise on this task. Surprisingly, we find an overlap between their requirements; A* requires more accurate predictions on search nodes near the goal, and LLMs need the same set of nodes for effective generalisation. With these insights, we derive a data-selection distribution for learning LLM-based heuristics. On three classical planning domains, maze navigation, Sokoban and sliding tile puzzles, our technique reduces the number of iterations required to find the solutions by up to 15x, with a wall-clock speed-up of search up to 5x.

      <description>arXiv:2408.12320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, numerous new LLMs have emerged, each possessing domain-specific expertise. This proliferation has highlighted the need for quick, high-quality, and cost-effective LLM query response methods. Yet, no single LLM exists to efficiently balance this trilemma. Some models are powerful but extremely costly, while others are fast and inexpensive but qualitatively inferior. To address this challenge, we present TO-Router, a non-monolithic LLM querying system that seamlessly integrates various LLM experts into a single query interface and dynamically routes incoming queries to the most high-performant expert based on query's requirements. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that when compared to standalone expert models, TO-Router improves query efficiency by up to 40\%, and leads to significant cost reductions of up to 30%, while maintaining or enhancing model performance by up to 10%.</description>

Abstract: Biases and errors in human-labeled data present significant challenges for machine learning, especially in supervised learning reliant on potentially flawed ground truth data. These flaws, including diagnostic errors and societal biases, risk being propagated and amplified through models trained using maximum likelihood estimation. We present the Reflective LLM Dialogue Framework RLDF, which leverages structured adversarial dialogues between multiple instances of a single LLM or different LLMs to uncover diverse perspectives and correct inconsistencies. By conditioning LLMs to adopt opposing stances, RLDF enables systematic bias detection through conditional statistics, information theory, and divergence metrics. Experiments show RLDF successfully identifies potential biases in public content while exposing limitations in human-labeled data. Our framework supports measurable progress tracking and explainable remediation actions, offering a scalable approach for improving content neutrality through transparent, multi-perspective analysis.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models to Generate Authentic Multi-agent Knowledge Work Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current publicly available knowledge work data collections lack diversity, extensive annotations, and contextual information about the users and their documents. These issues hinder objective and comparable data-driven evaluations and optimizations of knowledge work assistance systems. Due to the considerable resources needed to collect such data in real-life settings and the necessity of data censorship, collecting such a dataset appears nearly impossible. For this reason, we propose a configurable, multi-agent knowledge work dataset generator. This system simulates collaborative knowledge work among agents producing Large Language Model-generated documents and accompanying data traces. Additionally, the generator captures all background information, given in its configuration or created during the simulation process, in a knowledge graph. Finally, the resulting dataset can be utilized and shared without privacy or confidentiality concerns.
  This paper introduces our approach's design and vision and focuses on generating authentic knowledge work documents using Large Language Models. Our study involving human raters who assessed 53% of the generated and 74% of the real documents as realistic demonstrates the potential of our approach. Furthermore, we analyze the authenticity criteria mentioned in the participants' comments and elaborate on potential improvements for identified common issues.</description>

      <title>Mind Scramble: Unveiling Large Language Model Psychology Via Typoglycemia</title>

Abstract: Research into the external behaviors and internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in addressing complex tasks in the physical world. Studies suggest that powerful LLMs, like GPT-4, are beginning to exhibit human-like cognitive abilities, including planning, reasoning, and reflection. In this paper, we introduce a research line and methodology called LLM Psychology, leveraging human psychology experiments to investigate the cognitive behaviors and mechanisms of LLMs. We migrate the Typoglycemia phenomenon from psychology to explore the "mind" of LLMs. Unlike human brains, which rely on context and word patterns to comprehend scrambled text, LLMs use distinct encoding and decoding processes. Through Typoglycemia experiments at the character, word, and sentence levels, we observe: (I) LLMs demonstrate human-like behaviors on a macro scale, such as lower task accuracy and higher token/time consumption; (II) LLMs exhibit varying robustness to scrambled input, making Typoglycemia a benchmark for model evaluation without new datasets; (III) Different task types have varying impacts, with complex logical tasks (e.g., math) being more challenging in scrambled form; (IV) Each LLM has a unique and consistent "cognitive pattern" across tasks, revealing general mechanisms in its psychology process. We provide an in-depth analysis of hidden layers to explain these phenomena, paving the way for future research in LLM Psychology and deeper interpretability.</description>

      <title>Versatile Motion Language Models for Multi-Turn Interactive Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their ability to generate natural and contextually relevant text, making AI interactions more human-like. However, generating and understanding interactive human-like motion, where two individuals engage in coordinated movements, remains a challenge due to the complexity of modeling these coordinated interactions. Furthermore, a versatile model is required to handle diverse interactive scenarios, such as chat systems that follow user instructions or adapt to their assigned role while adjusting interaction dynamics. To tackle this problem, we introduce VIM, short for the Versatile Interactive Motion language model, which integrates both language and motion modalities to effectively understand, generate, and control interactive motions in multi-turn conversational contexts. To address the scarcity of multi-turn interactive motion data, we introduce a synthetic dataset, INERT-MT2, where we utilize pre-trained models to create diverse instructional datasets with interactive motion. Our approach first trains a motion tokenizer that encodes interactive motions into residual discrete tokens. In the pretraining stage, the model learns to align motion and text representations with these discrete tokens. During the instruction fine-tuning stage, VIM adapts to multi-turn conversations using the INTER-MT2 dataset. We evaluate the versatility of our method across motion-related tasks, motion to text, text to motion, reaction generation, motion editing, and reasoning about motion sequences. The results highlight the versatility and effectiveness of proposed method in handling complex interactive motion synthesis.</description>

      <title>Chain of Ideas: Revolutionizing Research in Novel Idea Development with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective research ideation is a critical step for scientific research. However, the exponential increase in scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current with recent advances and identify meaningful research directions. Recent developments in large language models~(LLMs) suggest a promising avenue for automating the generation of novel research ideas. However, existing methods for idea generation either trivially prompt LLMs or directly expose LLMs to extensive literature without indicating useful information. Inspired by the research process of human researchers, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas~(CoI) agent, an LLM-based agent that organizes relevant literature in a chain structure to effectively mirror the progressive development in a research domain. This organization facilitates LLMs to capture the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that can comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different perspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers. Experimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other methods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation. Moreover, our CoI agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of \$0.50 to generate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design.</description>

      <title>Disjointness Violations in Wikidata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disjointness checks are among the most important constraint checks in a knowledge base and can be used to help detect and correct incorrect statements and internal contradictions. Wikidata is a very large, community-managed knowledge base. Because of both its size and construction, Wikidata contains many incorrect statements and internal contradictions. We analyze the current modeling of disjointness on Wikidata, identify patterns that cause these disjointness violations and categorize them. We use SPARQL queries to identify each ``culprit'' causing a disjointness violation and lay out formulas to identify and fix conflicting information. We finally discuss how disjointness information could be better modeled and expanded in Wikidata in the future.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Large Language Models for Dynamic Constraints through Human-in-the-Loop Discriminators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across various real-world applications. However, due to the current text-in-text-out paradigm, it remains challenging for LLMs to handle dynamic and complex application constraints, let alone devise general solutions that meet predefined system goals. Current common practices like model finetuning and reflection-based reasoning often address these issues case-by-case, limiting their generalizability. To address this issue, we propose a flexible framework that enables LLMs to interact with system interfaces, summarize constraint concepts, and continually optimize performance metrics by collaborating with human experts. As a case in point, we initialized a travel planner agent by establishing constraints from evaluation interfaces. Then, we employed both LLM-based and human discriminators to identify critical cases and continuously improve agent performance until the desired outcomes were achieved. After just one iteration, our framework achieved a $7.78\%$ pass rate with the human discriminator (a $40.2\%$ improvement over baseline) and a $6.11\%$ pass rate with the LLM-based discriminator. Given the adaptability of our proposal, we believe this framework can be applied to a wide range of constraint-based applications and lay a solid foundation for model finetuning with performance-sensitive data samples.</description>

      <title>Medical-GAT: Cancer Document Classification Leveraging Graph-Based Residual Network for Scenarios with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate classification of cancer-related medical abstracts is crucial for healthcare management and research. However, obtaining large, labeled datasets in the medical domain is challenging due to privacy concerns and the complexity of clinical data. This scarcity of annotated data impedes the development of effective machine learning models for cancer document classification. To address this challenge, we present a curated dataset of 1,874 biomedical abstracts, categorized into thyroid cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and generic topics. Our research focuses on leveraging this dataset to improve classification performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. We introduce a Residual Graph Attention Network (R-GAT) with multiple graph attention layers that capture the semantic information and structural relationships within cancer-related documents. Our R-GAT model is compared with various techniques, including transformer-based models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), RoBERTa, and domain-specific models like BioBERT and Bio+ClinicalBERT. We also evaluated deep learning models (CNNs, LSTMs) and traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM). Additionally, we explore ensemble approaches that combine deep learning models to enhance classification. Various feature extraction methods are assessed, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) with unigrams and bigrams, Word2Vec, and tokenizers from BERT and RoBERTa. The R-GAT model outperforms other techniques, achieving precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.99, 0.97, and 0.98 for thyroid cancer; 0.96, 0.94, and 0.95 for colon cancer; 0.96, 0.99, and 0.97 for lung cancer; and 0.95, 0.96, and 0.95 for generic topics.</description>

      <title>HyperspectralViTs: General Hyperspectral Models for On-board Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-board processing of hyperspectral data with machine learning models would enable unprecedented amount of autonomy for a wide range of tasks, for example methane detection or mineral identification. This can enable early warning system and could allow new capabilities such as automated scheduling across constellations of satellites. Classical methods suffer from high false positive rates and previous deep learning models exhibit prohibitive computational requirements. We propose fast and accurate machine learning architectures which support end-to-end training with data of high spectral dimension without relying on hand-crafted products or spectral band compression preprocessing. We evaluate our models on two tasks related to hyperspectral data processing. With our proposed general architectures, we improve the F1 score of the previous methane detection state-of-the-art models by 27% on a newly created synthetic dataset and by 13% on the previously released large benchmark dataset. We also demonstrate that training models on the synthetic dataset improves performance of models finetuned on the dataset of real events by 6.9% in F1 score in contrast with training from scratch. On a newly created dataset for mineral identification, our models provide 3.5% improvement in the F1 score in contrast to the default versions of the models. With our proposed models we improve the inference speed by 85% in contrast to previous classical and deep learning approaches by removing the dependency on classically computed features. With our architecture, one capture from the EMIT sensor can be processed within 30 seconds on realistic proxy of the ION-SCV 004 satellite.</description>

      <title>ProgFed: Effective, Communication, and Computation Efficient Federated Learning by Progressive Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a powerful distributed learning scheme that allows numerous edge devices to collaboratively train a model without sharing their data. However, training is resource-intensive for edge devices, and limited network bandwidth is often the main bottleneck. Prior work often overcomes the constraints by condensing the models or messages into compact formats, e.g., by gradient compression or distillation. In contrast, we propose ProgFed, the first progressive training framework for efficient and effective federated learning. It inherently reduces computation and two-way communication costs while maintaining the strong performance of the final models. We theoretically prove that ProgFed converges at the same asymptotic rate as standard training on full models. Extensive results on a broad range of architectures, including CNNs (VGG, ResNet, ConvNets) and U-nets, and diverse tasks from simple classification to medical image segmentation show that our highly effective training approach saves up to $20\%$ computation and up to $63\%$ communication costs for converged models. As our approach is also complimentary to prior work on compression, we can achieve a wide range of trade-offs by combining these techniques, showing reduced communication of up to $50\times$ at only $0.1\%$ loss in utility. Code is available at https://github.com/hui-po-wang/ProgFed.</description>

      <title>Neural-Rendezvous: Provably Robust Guidance and Control to Encounter Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) are likely representatives of primitive materials invaluable in understanding exoplanetary star systems. Due to their poorly constrained orbits with generally high inclinations and relative velocities, however, exploring ISOs with conventional human-in-the-loop approaches is significantly challenging. This paper presents Neural-Rendezvous -- a deep learning-based guidance and control framework for encountering fast-moving objects, including ISOs, robustly, accurately, and autonomously in real time. It uses pointwise minimum norm tracking control on top of a guidance policy modeled by a spectrally-normalized deep neural network, where its hyperparameters are tuned with a loss function directly penalizing the MPC state trajectory tracking error. We show that Neural-Rendezvous provides a high probability exponential bound on the expected spacecraft delivery error, the proof of which leverages stochastic incremental stability analysis. In particular, it is used to construct a non-negative function with a supermartingale property, explicitly accounting for the ISO state uncertainty and the local nature of nonlinear state estimation guarantees. In numerical simulations, Neural-Rendezvous is demonstrated to satisfy the expected error bound for 100 ISO candidates. This performance is also empirically validated using our spacecraft simulator and in high-conflict and distributed UAV swarm reconfiguration with up to 20 UAVs.</description>

      <title>Inverting Cryptographic Hash Functions via Cube-and-Conquer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MD4 and MD5 are fundamental cryptographic hash functions proposed in the early 1990s. MD4 consists of 48 steps and produces a 128-bit hash given a message of arbitrary finite size. MD5 is a more secure 64-step extension of MD4. Both MD4 and MD5 are vulnerable to practical collision attacks, yet it is still not realistic to invert them, i.e., to find a message given a hash. In 2007, the 39-step version of MD4 was inverted by reducing to SAT and applying a CDCL solver along with the so-called Dobbertin's constraints. As for MD5, in 2012 its 28-step version was inverted via a CDCL solver for one specified hash without adding any extra constraints. In this study, Cube-and-Conquer (a combination of CDCL and lookahead) is applied to invert step-reduced versions of MD4 and MD5. For this purpose, two algorithms are proposed. The first one generates inverse problems for MD4 by gradually modifying the Dobbertin's constraints. The second algorithm tries the cubing phase of Cube-and-Conquer with different cutoff thresholds to find the one with the minimum runtime estimate of the conquer phase. This algorithm operates in two modes: (i) estimating the hardness of a given propositional Boolean formula; (ii) incomplete SAT solving of a given satisfiable propositional Boolean formula. While the first algorithm is focused on inverting step-reduced MD4, the second one is not area-specific and is therefore applicable to a variety of classes of hard SAT instances. In this study, 40-, 41-, 42-, and 43-step MD4 are inverted for the first time via the first algorithm and the estimating mode of the second algorithm. Also, 28-step MD5 is inverted for four hashes via the incomplete SAT solving mode of the second algorithm. For three hashes out of them, it is done for the first time.</description>

      <title>ARBEx: Attentive Feature Extraction with Reliability Balancing for Robust Facial Expression Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01486v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a framework ARBEx, a novel attentive feature extraction framework driven by Vision Transformer with reliability balancing to cope against poor class distributions, bias, and uncertainty in the facial expression learning (FEL) task. We reinforce several data pre-processing and refinement methods along with a window-based cross-attention ViT to squeeze the best of the data. We also employ learnable anchor points in the embedding space with label distributions and multi-head self-attention mechanism to optimize performance against weak predictions with reliability balancing, which is a strategy that leverages anchor points, attention scores, and confidence values to enhance the resilience of label predictions. To ensure correct label classification and improve the models' discriminative power, we introduce anchor loss, which encourages large margins between anchor points. Additionally, the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which is also trainable, plays an integral role in identifying accurate labels. This approach provides critical elements for improving the reliability of predictions and has a substantial positive effect on final prediction capabilities. Our adaptive model can be integrated with any deep neural network to forestall challenges in various recognition tasks. Our strategy outperforms current state-of-the-art methodologies, according to extensive experiments conducted in a variety of contexts.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful subset of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), outperforming traditional ML methods, especially in handling unstructured and large datasets. Its impact spans across various domains, including speech recognition, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, predictive analytics, and more. However, the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world problems present challenges in designing effective deep learning models. Consequently, several deep learning models have been developed to address different problems and applications. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Models, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Deep Transfer Learning. We examine the structure, applications, benefits, and limitations of each model. Furthermore, we perform an analysis using three publicly available datasets: IMDB, ARAS, and Fruit-360. We compare the performance of six renowned deep learning models: CNN, Simple RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU.</description>

      <title>RealignDiff: Boosting Text-to-Image Diffusion Model with Coarse-to-fine Semantic Re-alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19599v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality, realistic images from textual descriptions. However, these approaches have faced challenges in precisely aligning the generated visual content with the textual concepts described in the prompts. In this paper, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine semantic re-alignment method, named RealignDiff, aimed at improving the alignment between text and images in text-to-image diffusion models. In the coarse semantic re-alignment phase, a novel caption reward, leveraging the BLIP-2 model, is proposed to evaluate the semantic discrepancy between the generated image caption and the given text prompt. Subsequently, the fine semantic re-alignment stage employs a local dense caption generation module and a re-weighting attention modulation module to refine the previously generated images from a local semantic view. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and ViLG-300 datasets demonstrate that the proposed two-stage coarse-to-fine semantic re-alignment method outperforms other baseline re-alignment techniques by a substantial margin in both visual quality and semantic similarity with the input prompt.</description>

      <title>RegExplainer: Generating Explanations for Graph Neural Networks in Regression Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07840</link>

Abstract: Graph regression is a fundamental task that has gained significant attention in various graph learning tasks. However, the inference process is often not easily interpretable. Current explanation techniques are limited to understanding Graph Neural Network (GNN) behaviors in classification tasks, leaving an explanation gap for graph regression models. In this work, we propose a novel explanation method to interpret the graph regression models (XAIG-R). Our method addresses the distribution shifting problem and continuously ordered decision boundary issues that hinder existing methods away from being applied in regression tasks. We introduce a novel objective based on the graph information bottleneck theory (GIB) and a new mix-up framework, which can support various GNNs and explainers in a model-agnostic manner. Additionally, we present a self-supervised learning strategy to tackle the continuously ordered labels in regression tasks. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets and a real-life dataset introduced by us, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in interpreting GNN models in regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Model Predictive Control for Highway Ramp Metering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the backdrop of an increasingly pressing need for effective urban and highway transportation systems, this work explores the synergy between model-based and learning-based strategies to enhance traffic flow management by use of an innovative approach to the problem of ramp metering control that embeds Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.</description>

      <title>Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14900v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</description>

      <title>Efficient End-to-end Language Model Fine-tuning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has attracted significant attention due to its wide range of real-world applications. The rapid evolution of language models (LMs) has revolutionized the way we process textual data, which indicates a strong potential to replace shallow text embedding generally used in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, we find that existing LM approaches that exploit text information in graphs suffer from inferior computation and data efficiency. In this study, we introduce LEADING, a novel and efficient approach for end-to-end fine-tuning of language models on TAGs. To enhance data efficiency, LEADING efficiently transfers rich knowledge from LMs to downstream graph learning tasks with limited labeled data by employing end-to-end training of LMs and GNNs in a semi-supervised learning setting. To address associated computation efficiency issues, it introduces two techniques: neighbor decoupling targeting LMs and implicit graph modeling targeting GNNs, respectively. Our proposed approach demonstrates superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the ogbn-arxiv leaderboard, while maintaining computation cost and memory overhead comparable to graph-less fine-tuning of LMs. Through comprehensive experiments, we showcase its superior computation and data efficiency, presenting a promising solution for various LMs and graph learning tasks on TAGs.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Offline Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning with Constrained Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL) in the offline setting has succeeded greatly in industrial applications such as chatbots. A two-step learning framework where one applies a reinforcement learning step after a reward modeling step has been widely adopted for the problem. However, such a method faces challenges from the risk of reward hacking and the complexity of reinforcement learning. To overcome the challenge, our insight is that both challenges come from the state-actions not supported in the dataset. Such state-actions are unreliable and increase the complexity of the reinforcement learning problem at the second step. Based on the insight, we develop a novel two-step learning method called PRC: preference-based reinforcement learning with constrained actions. The high-level idea is to limit the reinforcement learning agent to optimize over a constrained action space that excludes the out-of-distribution state-actions. We empirically verify that our method has high learning efficiency on various datasets in robotic control environments.</description>

      <title>LeTO: Learning Constrained Visuomotor Policy with Differentiable Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces LeTO, a method for learning constrained visuomotor policy with differentiable trajectory optimization. Our approach integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and constraint-controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraint information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This ``gray box" method marries optimization-based safety and interpretability with powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and in the real robot. The results demonstrate that LeTO performs well in both simulated and real-world tasks. In addition, it is capable of generating trajectories that are less uncertain, higher quality, and smoother compared to existing imitation learning methods. Therefore, it is shown that LeTO provides a practical example of how to achieve the integration of neural networks with trajectory optimization. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</description>

      <title>Credal Learning Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00957v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical learning theory is the foundation of machine learning, providing theoretical bounds for the risk of models learned from a (single) training set, assumed to issue from an unknown probability distribution. In actual deployment, however, the data distribution may (and often does) vary, causing domain adaptation/generalization issues. In this paper we lay the foundations for a `credal' theory of learning, using convex sets of probabilities (credal sets) to model the variability in the data-generating distribution. Such credal sets, we argue, may be inferred from a finite sample of training sets. Bounds are derived for the case of finite hypotheses spaces (both assuming realizability or not), as well as infinite model spaces, which directly generalize classical results.</description>

      <title>ServeFlow: A Fast-Slow Model Architecture for Network Traffic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network traffic analysis increasingly uses complex machine learning models as the internet consolidates and traffic gets more encrypted. However, over high-bandwidth networks, flows can easily arrive faster than model inference rates. The temporal nature of network flows limits simple scale-out approaches leveraged in other high-traffic machine learning applications. Accordingly, this paper presents ServeFlow, a solution for machine-learning model serving aimed at network traffic analysis tasks, which carefully selects the number of packets to collect and the models to apply for individual flows to achieve a balance between minimal latency, high service rate, and high accuracy. We identify that on the same task, inference time across models can differ by 1.8x - 141.3x, while the inter-packet waiting time is up to 6-8 orders of magnitude higher than the inference time! Based on these insights, we tailor a novel fast-slow model architecture for networking ML pipelines. Flows are assigned to a slower model only when the inferences from the fast model are deemed high uncertainty. ServeFlow is able to make inferences on 76.3% of flows in under 16ms, which is a speed-up of 40.5x on the median end-to-end serving latency while increasing the service rate and maintaining similar accuracy. Even with thousands of features per flow, it achieves a service rate of over 48.5k new flows per second on a 16-core CPU commodity server, which matches the order of magnitude of flow rates observed on city-level network backbones.</description>

      <title>Universal Black-Box Reward Poisoning Attack against Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of universal black-boxed reward poisoning attacks against general offline reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. We consider a black-box threat model where the attacker is entirely oblivious to the learning algorithm, and its budget is limited by constraining the amount of corruption at each data point and the total perturbation. We require the attack to be universally efficient against any efficient algorithms that might be used by the agent. We propose an attack strategy called the `policy contrast attack.' The idea is to find low- and high-performing policies covered by the dataset and make them appear to be high- and low-performing to the agent, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first universal black-box reward poisoning attack in the general offline RL setting. We provide theoretical insights on the attack design and empirically show that our attack is efficient against current state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms in different learning datasets.</description>

      <title>Provably Safe Neural Network Controllers via Differential Dynamic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While neural networks (NNs) have potential as autonomous controllers for Cyber-Physical Systems, verifying the safety of NN based control systems (NNCSs) poses significant challenges for the practical use of NNs, especially when safety is needed for unbounded time horizons. One reason is the intractability of analyzing NNs, ODEs and hybrid systems. To this end, we introduce VerSAILLE (Verifiably Safe AI via Logically Linked Envelopes): The first general approach that allows reusing control theory results for NNCS verification. By joining forces, we exploit the efficiency of NN verification tools while retaining the rigor of differential dynamic logic (dL). Based on provably safe control envelopes in dL, we derive specifications for the NN which is proven via NN verification. We show that a proof of the NN adhering to the specification is mirrored by a dL proof on the infinite-time safety of the NNCS.
  The NN verification properties resulting from hybrid systems typically contain nonlinear arithmetic and arbitrary logical structures while efficient NN verification merely supports linear constraints. To overcome this divide, we present Mosaic: An efficient, sound and complete verification approach for polynomial real arithmetic properties on piece-wise linear NNs. Mosaic partitions complex verification queries into simple queries and lifts off-the-shelf linear constraint tools to the nonlinear setting in a completeness-preserving manner by combining approximation with exact reasoning for counterexample regions. Our evaluation demonstrates the versatility of VerSAILLE and Mosaic: We prove infinite-time safety on the classical Vertical Airborne Collision Avoidance NNCS verification benchmark for two scenarios while (exhaustively) enumerating counterexample regions in unsafe scenarios. We also show that our approach significantly outperforms State-of-the-Art tools in closed-loop NNV.</description>

      <title>The Male CEO and the Female Assistant: Evaluation and Mitigation of Gender Biases in Text-To-Image Generation of Dual Subjects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large-scale T2I models like DALLE-3 have made progress in reducing gender stereotypes when generating single-person images. However, significant biases remain when generating images with more than one person. To systematically evaluate this, we propose the Paired Stereotype Test (PST) framework, which queries T2I models to depict two individuals assigned with male-stereotyped and female-stereotyped social identities, respectively (e.g. "a CEO" and "an Assistant"). This contrastive setting often triggers T2I models to generate gender-stereotyped images. Using PST, we evaluate two aspects of gender biases -- the well-known bias in gendered occupation and a novel aspect: bias in organizational power. Experiments show that over 74% images generated by DALLE-3 display gender-occupational biases. Additionally, compared to single-person settings, DALLE-3 is more likely to perpetuate male-associated stereotypes under PST. We further propose FairCritic, a novel and interpretable framework that leverages an LLM-based critic model to i) detect bias in generated images, and ii) adaptively provide feedback to T2I models for improving fairness. FairCritic achieves near-perfect fairness on PST, overcoming the limitations of previous prompt-based intervention approaches.</description>

      <title>TimeXer: Empowering Transformers for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep models have demonstrated remarkable performance in time series forecasting. However, due to the partially-observed nature of real-world applications, solely focusing on the target of interest, so-called endogenous variables, is usually insufficient to guarantee accurate forecasting. Notably, a system is often recorded into multiple variables, where the exogenous variables can provide valuable external information for endogenous variables. Thus, unlike well-established multivariate or univariate forecasting paradigms that either treat all the variables equally or ignore exogenous information, this paper focuses on a more practical setting: time series forecasting with exogenous variables. We propose a novel approach, TimeXer, to ingest external information to enhance the forecasting of endogenous variables. With deftly designed embedding layers, TimeXer empowers the canonical Transformer with the ability to reconcile endogenous and exogenous information, where patch-wise self-attention and variate-wise cross-attention are used simultaneously. Moreover, global endogenous tokens are learned to effectively bridge the causal information underlying exogenous series into endogenous temporal patches. Experimentally, TimeXer achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on twelve real-world forecasting benchmarks and exhibits notable generality and scalability. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/TimeXer.</description>

      <title>Structuring Concept Space with the Musical Circle of Fifths by Utilizing Music Grammar Based Activations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intriguing similarities between the structure of a discrete neural network, such as a spiking network, and the composition of a piano piece. While both involve nodes or notes that are activated sequentially or in parallel, the latter benefits from the rich body of music theory to guide meaningful combinations. We propose a novel approach that leverages musical grammar to regulate activations in a spiking neural network, allowing for the representation of symbols as attractors. By applying rules for chord progressions from music theory, we demonstrate how certain activations naturally follow others, akin to the concept of attraction. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of modulating keys to navigate different basins of attraction within the network. Ultimately, we show that the map of concepts in our model is structured by the musical circle of fifths, highlighting the potential for leveraging music theory principles in deep learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>AutoRD: An Automatic and End-to-End System for Rare Disease Knowledge Graph Construction Based on Ontologies-enhanced Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare diseases affect millions worldwide but often face limited research focus due to their low prevalence. This results in prolonged diagnoses and a lack of approved therapies. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating the extraction of medical information, offering potential to improve medical diagnosis and management. However, most LLMs lack professional medical knowledge, especially concerning rare diseases, and struggle to handle the latest rare disease information. They also cannot effectively manage rare disease data and are not directly suitable for diagnosis and management tasks. Our objective is to create an end-to-end system called AutoRD, which automates the extraction of information from medical texts about rare diseases, focusing on entities and their relations. AutoRD integrates up-to-date structured knowledge and demonstrates superior performance in rare disease extraction tasks. We conduct various experiments to evaluate AutoRD's performance, aiming to surpass common LLMs and traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Iterated $Q$-Network: Beyond One-Step Bellman Updates in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of Reinforcement Learning methods is largely impacted by the computation effort and data requirements needed to obtain effective estimates of action-value functions, which in turn determine the quality of the overall performance and the sample-efficiency of the learning procedure. Typically, action-value functions are estimated through an iterative scheme that alternates the application of an empirical approximation of the Bellman operator and a subsequent projection step onto a considered function space. It has been observed that this scheme can be potentially generalized to carry out multiple iterations of the Bellman operator at once, benefiting the underlying learning algorithm. However, till now, it has been challenging to effectively implement this idea, especially in high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we introduce iterated $Q$-Network (i-QN), a novel principled approach that enables multiple consecutive Bellman updates by learning a tailored sequence of action-value functions where each serves as the target for the next. We show that i-QN is theoretically grounded and that it can be seamlessly used in value-based and actor-critic methods. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of i-QN in Atari $2600$ games and MuJoCo continuous control problems.</description>

      <title>SCANet: Correcting LEGO Assembly Errors with Self-Correct Assembly Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous assembly in robotics and 3D vision presents significant challenges, particularly in ensuring assembly correctness. Presently, predominant methods such as MEPNet focus on assembling components based on manually provided images. However, these approaches often fall short in achieving satisfactory results for tasks requiring long-term planning. Concurrently, we observe that integrating a self-correction module can partially alleviate such issues. Motivated by this concern, we introduce the Single-Step Assembly Error Correction Task, which involves identifying and rectifying misassembled components. To support research in this area, we present the LEGO Error Correction Assembly Dataset (LEGO-ECA), comprising manual images for assembly steps and instances of assembly failures. Additionally, we propose the Self-Correct Assembly Network (SCANet), a novel method to address this task. SCANet treats assembled components as queries, determining their correctness in manual images and providing corrections when necessary. Finally, we utilize SCANet to correct the assembly results of MEPNet. Experimental results demonstrate that SCANet can identify and correct MEPNet's misassembled results, significantly improving the correctness of assembly. Our code and dataset could be found at https://scanet-iros2024.github.io/.</description>

      <title>PnLCalib: Sports Field Registration via Points and Lines Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Camera calibration in broadcast sports videos presents numerous challenges for accurate sports field registration due to multiple camera angles, varying camera parameters, and frequent occlusions of the field. Traditional search-based methods depend on initial camera pose estimates, which can struggle in non-standard positions and dynamic environments. In response, we propose an optimization-based calibration pipeline that leverages a 3D soccer field model and a predefined set of keypoints to overcome these limitations. Our method also introduces a novel refinement module that improves initial calibration by using detected field lines in a non-linear optimization process. This approach outperforms existing techniques in both multi-view and single-view 3D camera calibration tasks, while maintaining competitive performance in homography estimation. Extensive experimentation on real-world soccer datasets, including SoccerNet-Calibration, WorldCup 2014, and TS-WorldCup, highlights the robustness and accuracy of our method across diverse broadcast scenarios. Our approach offers significant improvements in camera calibration precision and reliability.</description>

      <title>White Men Lead, Black Women Help? Benchmarking Language Agency Social Biases in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10508v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social biases can manifest in language agency. While several studies approached agency-related bias in human-written language, very limited research has investigated such biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content. In addition, previous works often rely on string-matching techniques to identify agentic and communal words within texts, which fall short of accurately classifying language agency. We introduce the novel Language Agency Bias Evaluation (LABE) benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates biases in LLMs by analyzing agency levels attributed to different demographic groups in model generations. LABE leverages 5,400 template-based prompts, an accurate agency classifier, and corresponding bias metrics to test for gender, racial, and intersectional language agency biases in LLMs on 3 text generation tasks: biographies, professor reviews, and reference letters. We also contribute the Language Agency Classification (LAC) dataset, consisting of 3,724 agentic and communal sentences. Using LABE, we unveil language agency social biases in 3 recent LLMs: ChatGPT, Llama3, and Mistral. We observe that: (1) LLM generations tend to demonstrate greater gender bias than human-written texts; (2) Models demonstrate remarkably higher levels of intersectional bias than the other bias aspects. Those who are at the intersection of gender and racial minority groups--such as Black females--are consistently described by texts with lower levels of agency, aligning with real-world social inequalities; (3) Among the 3 LLMs investigated, Llama3 demonstrates the greatest overall bias; (4) Not only does prompt-based mitigation fail to resolve language agency bias in LLMs, but it frequently leads to the exacerbation of biases in generated texts.</description>

      <title>FlashSpeech: Efficient Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis has been significantly advanced by language models and diffusion models. However, the generation process of both methods is slow and computationally intensive. Efficient speech synthesis using a lower computing budget to achieve quality on par with previous work remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present FlashSpeech, a large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis system with approximately 5\% of the inference time compared with previous work. FlashSpeech is built on the latent consistency model and applies a novel adversarial consistency training approach that can train from scratch without the need for a pre-trained diffusion model as the teacher. Furthermore, a new prosody generator module enhances the diversity of prosody, making the rhythm of the speech sound more natural. The generation processes of FlashSpeech can be achieved efficiently with one or two sampling steps while maintaining high audio quality and high similarity to the audio prompt for zero-shot speech generation. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of FlashSpeech. Notably, FlashSpeech can be about 20 times faster than other zero-shot speech synthesis systems while maintaining comparable performance in terms of voice quality and similarity. Furthermore, FlashSpeech demonstrates its versatility by efficiently performing tasks like voice conversion, speech editing, and diverse speech sampling. Audio samples can be found in https://flashspeech.github.io/.</description>

      <title>XC-Cache: Cross-Attending to Cached Context for Efficient LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) approaches typically leverage prompting to condition decoder-only language model generation on reference information. Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model parameters. When the right context isn't known in advance, caching ICL can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers. We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform ICL, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drastically reduce the space footprint relative to standard KV caching by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection with a Single Unconditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning that seeks to identify abnormal samples. Traditionally, unsupervised methods utilize a deep generative model for OOD detection. However, such approaches require a new model to be trained for each inlier dataset. This paper explores whether a single model can perform OOD detection across diverse tasks. To that end, we introduce Diffusion Paths (DiffPath), which uses a single diffusion model originally trained to perform unconditional generation for OOD detection. We introduce a novel technique of measuring the rate-of-change and curvature of the diffusion paths connecting samples to the standard normal. Extensive experiments show that with a single model, DiffPath is competitive with prior work using individual models on a variety of OOD tasks involving different distributions. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/clear-nus/diffpath.</description>

      <title>Boosting X-formers with Structured Matrix for Long Sequence Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models for long sequence time series forecasting problems have gained significant attention due to their exceptional forecasting precision. However, the self-attention mechanism introduces challenges in terms of computational efficiency due to its quadratic time complexity. To address these issues, we propose a novel architectural framework that enhances Transformer models through the integration of Surrogate Attention Blocks (SAB) and Surrogate Feed-Forward Neural Network Blocks (SFB). They replace the self-attention and feed-forward layer by leveraging structured matrices that reduce both time and space complexity while maintaining the expressive power of the original self-attention mechanism and feed-forward network. The equivalence of this substitution is fully demonstrated. Extensive experiments on nine Transformer variants across five distinct time series tasks demonstrate an average performance improvement of 9.45%, alongside a 46% reduction in model size. These results confirm the efficacy of our surrogate-based approach in maintaining prediction accuracy while significantly boosting computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>System Safety Monitoring of Learned Components Using Temporal Metric Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In learning-enabled autonomous systems, safety monitoring of learned components is crucial to ensure their outputs do not lead to system safety violations, given the operational context of the system. However, developing a safety monitor for practical deployment in real-world applications is challenging. This is due to limited access to internal workings and training data of the learned component. Furthermore, safety monitors should predict safety violations with low latency, while consuming a reasonable amount of computation.
  To address the challenges, we propose a safety monitoring method based on probabilistic time series forecasting. Given the learned component outputs and an operational context, we empirically investigate different Deep Learning (DL)-based probabilistic forecasting to predict the objective measure capturing the satisfaction or violation of a safety requirement (safety metric). We empirically evaluate safety metric and violation prediction accuracy, and inference latency and resource usage of four state-of-the-art models, with varying horizons, using autonomous aviation and autonomous driving case studies. Our results suggest that probabilistic forecasting of safety metrics, given learned component outputs and scenarios, is effective for safety monitoring. Furthermore, for both case studies, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) was the most accurate model for predicting imminent safety violations, with acceptable latency and resource consumption.</description>

      <title>No Filter: Cultural and Socioeconomic Diversity in Contrastive Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cultural and socioeconomic diversity in contrastive vision-language models (VLMs). Using a broad range of benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, we bring to attention several important findings. First, the common filtering of training data to English image-text pairs disadvantages communities of lower socioeconomic status and negatively impacts cultural understanding. Notably, this performance gap is not captured by - and even at odds with - the currently popular evaluation metrics derived from the Western-centric ImageNet and COCO datasets. Second, pretraining with global, unfiltered data before fine-tuning on English content can improve cultural understanding without sacrificing performance on said popular benchmarks. Third, we introduce the task of geo-localization as a novel evaluation metric to assess cultural diversity in VLMs. Our work underscores the value of using diverse data to create more inclusive multimodal systems and lays the groundwork for developing VLMs that better represent global perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraint-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) involves policy constraints or imposing penalties on the value function to mitigate overestimation errors caused by distributional shift. This paper focuses on a limitation in existing offline RL methods with penalized value function, indicating the potential for underestimation bias due to unnecessary bias introduced in the value function. To address this concern, we propose Exclusively Penalized Q-learning (EPQ), which reduces estimation bias in the value function by selectively penalizing states that are prone to inducing estimation errors. Numerical results show that our method significantly reduces underestimation bias and improves performance in various offline control tasks compared to other offline RL methods</description>

      <title>ECG Semantic Integrator (ESI): A Foundation ECG Model Pretrained with LLM-Enhanced Cardiological Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The utilization of deep learning on electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has brought the advanced accuracy and efficiency of cardiac healthcare diagnostics. By leveraging the capabilities of deep learning in semantic understanding, especially in feature extraction and representation learning, this study introduces a new multimodal contrastive pretaining framework that aims to improve the quality and robustness of learned representations of 12-lead ECG signals. Our framework comprises two key components, including Cardio Query Assistant (CQA) and ECG Semantics Integrator(ESI). CQA integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to leverage large language models (LLMs) and external medical knowledge to generate detailed textual descriptions of ECGs. The generated text is enriched with information about demographics and waveform patterns. ESI integrates both contrastive and captioning loss to pretrain ECG encoders for enhanced representations. We validate our approach through various downstream tasks, including arrhythmia detection and ECG-based subject identification. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over strong baselines in these tasks. These baselines encompass supervised and self-supervised learning methods, as well as prior multimodal pretraining approaches.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Human Questioning Behavior and Causal Curiosity through Natural Queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has changed our role in interacting with them. Instead of primarily testing these models with questions we already know the answers to, we now use them to explore questions where the answers are unknown to us. This shift, which hasn't been fully addressed in existing datasets, highlights the growing need to understand naturally occurring human questions - that are more complex, open-ended, and reflective of real-world needs. To this end, we present NatQuest, a collection of 13,500 naturally occurring questions from three diverse sources: human-to-search-engine queries, human-to-human interactions, and human-to-LLM conversations. Our comprehensive collection enables a rich understanding of human curiosity across various domains and contexts. Our analysis reveals a significant presence of causal questions (up to 42%) within the dataset, for which we develop an iterative prompt improvement framework to identify all causal queries, and examine their unique linguistic properties, cognitive complexity, and source distribution. We also lay the groundwork to explore LLM performance on these questions and provide six efficient classification models to identify causal questions at scale for future work.</description>

      <title>RE-RAG: Improving Open-Domain QA Performance and Interpretability with Relevance Estimator in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework utilizes a combination of parametric knowledge and external knowledge to demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on open-domain question answering tasks. However, the RAG framework suffers from performance degradation when the query is accompanied by irrelevant contexts. In this work, we propose the RE-RAG framework, which introduces a relevance estimator (RE) that not only provides relative relevance between contexts as previous rerankers did, but also provides confidence, which can be used to classify whether given context is useful for answering the given question. We propose a weakly supervised method for training the RE simply utilizing question-answer data without any labels for correct contexts. We show that RE trained with a small generator (sLM) can not only improve the sLM fine-tuned together with RE but also improve previously unreferenced large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, we investigate new decoding strategies that utilize the proposed confidence measured by RE such as choosing to let the user know that it is "unanswerable" to answer the question given the retrieved contexts or choosing to rely on LLM's parametric knowledge rather than unrelated contexts.</description>

      <title>CoEvol: Constructing Better Responses for Instruction Finetuning through Multi-Agent Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, instruction fine-tuning (IFT) on large language models (LLMs) has garnered considerable attention to enhance model performance on unseen tasks. Attempts have been made on automatic construction and effective selection for IFT data. However, we posit that previous methods have not fully harnessed the potential of LLMs for enhancing data quality. The responses within IFT data could be further enhanced by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs themselves. In this paper, we propose CoEvol, an LLM-based multi-agent cooperation framework for the improvement of responses to instructions. To effectively refine the responses, we develop an iterative framework following a debate-advise-edit-judge paradigm. A two-stage multi-agent debate strategy is further devised to ensure the diversity and reliability of editing suggestions within the framework. Empirically, models equipped with CoEvol outperform competitive baselines evaluated by MT-Bench and AlpacaEval, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing instruction-following capabilities for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Is One GPU Enough? Pushing Image Generation at Higher-Resolutions with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Pixelsmith, a zero-shot text-to-image generative framework to sample images at higher resolutions with a single GPU. We are the first to show that it is possible to scale the output of a pre-trained diffusion model by a factor of 1000, opening the road for gigapixel image generation at no additional cost. Our cascading method uses the image generated at the lowest resolution as a baseline to sample at higher resolutions. For the guidance, we introduce the Slider, a tunable mechanism that fuses the overall structure contained in the first-generated image with enhanced fine details. At each inference step, we denoise patches rather than the entire latent space, minimizing memory demands such that a single GPU can handle the process, regardless of the image's resolution. Our experimental results show that Pixelsmith not only achieves higher quality and diversity compared to existing techniques, but also reduces sampling time and artifacts. The code for our work is available at https://github.com/Thanos-DB/Pixelsmith.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Object Detection with Theoretical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised object detection using deep neural networks is typically a difficult problem with few to no guarantees about the learned representation. In this work we present the first unsupervised object detection method that is theoretically guaranteed to recover the true object positions up to quantifiable small shifts. We develop an unsupervised object detection architecture and prove that the learned variables correspond to the true object positions up to small shifts related to the encoder and decoder receptive field sizes, the object sizes, and the widths of the Gaussians used in the rendering process. We perform detailed analysis of how the error depends on each of these variables and perform synthetic experiments validating our theoretical predictions up to a precision of individual pixels. We also perform experiments on CLEVR-based data and show that, unlike current SOTA object detection methods (SAM, CutLER), our method's prediction errors always lie within our theoretical bounds. We hope that this work helps open up an avenue of research into object detection methods with theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Dispelling the Mirage of Progress in Offline MARL through Standardised Baselines and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is an emerging field with great promise for real-world applications. Unfortunately, the current state of research in offline MARL is plagued by inconsistencies in baselines and evaluation protocols, which ultimately makes it difficult to accurately assess progress, trust newly proposed innovations, and allow researchers to easily build upon prior work. In this paper, we firstly identify significant shortcomings in existing methodologies for measuring the performance of novel algorithms through a representative study of published offline MARL work. Secondly, by directly comparing to this prior work, we demonstrate that simple, well-implemented baselines can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across a wide range of tasks. Specifically, we show that on 35 out of 47 datasets used in prior work (almost 75% of cases), we match or surpass the performance of the current purported SOTA. Strikingly, our baselines often substantially outperform these more sophisticated algorithms. Finally, we correct for the shortcomings highlighted from this prior work by introducing a straightforward standardised methodology for evaluation and by providing our baseline implementations with statistically robust results across several scenarios, useful for comparisons in future work. Our proposal includes simple and sensible steps that are easy to adopt, which in combination with solid baselines and comparative results, could substantially improve the overall rigour of empirical science in offline MARL moving forward.</description>

      <title>CollabStory: Multi-LLM Collaborative Story Generation and Authorship Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of unifying frameworks that enable seamless interoperability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made LLM-LLM collaboration for open-ended tasks a possibility. Despite this, there have not been efforts to explore such collaborative writing. We take the next step beyond human-LLM collaboration to explore this multi-LLM scenario by generating the first exclusively LLM-generated collaborative stories dataset called CollabStory. We focus on single-author ($N=1$) to multi-author (up to $N=5$) scenarios, where multiple LLMs co-author stories. We generate over 32k stories using open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. Further, we take inspiration from the PAN tasks that have set the standard for human-human multi-author writing tasks and analysis. We extend their authorship-related tasks for multi-LLM settings and present baselines for LLM-LLM collaboration. We find that current baselines are not able to handle this emerging scenario. Thus, CollabStory is a resource that could help propel an understanding as well as the development of techniques to discern the use of multiple LLMs. This is crucial to study in the context of writing tasks since LLM-LLM collaboration could potentially overwhelm ongoing challenges related to plagiarism detection, credit assignment, maintaining academic integrity in educational settings, and addressing copyright infringement concerns. We make our dataset and code available at \texttt{\url{https://github.com/saranya-venkatraman/multi_llm_story_writing}}.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Language Models in the Medical Context Under Resource-Constrained Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the Transformer architecture emerged, language model development has grown, driven by their promising potential. Releasing these models into production requires properly understanding their behavior, particularly in sensitive domains like medicine. Despite this need, the medical literature still lacks practical assessment of pre-trained language models, which are especially valuable in settings where only consumer-grade computational resources are available. To address this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey of language models in the medical field and evaluated a subset of these for medical text classification and conditional text generation. The subset includes 53 models with 110 million to 13 billion parameters, spanning the Transformer-based model families and knowledge domains. Different approaches are employed for text classification, including zero-shot learning, enabling tuning without the need to train the model. These approaches are helpful in our target settings, where many users of language models find themselves. The results reveal remarkable performance across the tasks and datasets evaluated, underscoring the potential of certain models to contain medical knowledge, even without domain specialization. This study thus advocates for further exploration of model applications in medical contexts, particularly in computational resource-constrained settings, to benefit a wide range of users. The code is available on https://github.com/anpoc/Language-models-in-medicine.</description>

      <title>Infinite Width Models That Work: Why Feature Learning Doesn't Matter as Much as You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common infinite-width architectures such as Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) have historically shown weak performance compared to finite models. This is usually attributed to the absence of feature learning. We show that this explanation is insufficient. Specifically, we show that infinite width NTKs obviate the need for feature learning. They can learn identical behavior by selecting relevant subfeatures from their (infinite) frozen feature vector. Furthermore, we show experimentally that NTKs under-perform traditional finite models even when feature learning is artificially disabled. Instead, we show that weak performance is at least partly due to the fact that existing constructions depend on weak optimizers like SGD. We provide a new infinite width limit based on ADAM-like learning dynamics and demonstrate empirically that the resulting models erase this performance gap.</description>

      <title>All Random Features Representations are Equivalent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random features are a powerful technique for rewriting positive-definite kernels as linear products. They bring linear tools to bear in important nonlinear domains like KNNs and attention. Unfortunately, practical implementations require approximating an expectation, usually via sampling. This has led to the development of increasingly elaborate representations with ever lower sample error. We resolve this arms race by deriving an optimal sampling policy. Under this policy all random features representations have the same approximation error, which we show is the lowest possible. This means that we are free to choose whatever representation we please, provided we sample optimally.</description>

      <title>Time Matters: Scaling Laws for Any Budget</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A primary cost driver for training large models is wall-clock training time. We show that popular time estimates based on FLOPs are poor estimates, and construct a more accurate proxy based on memory copies. This allows us to accurately estimate the training speed of a transformer model from its hyperparameters. Combined with a scaling law curve like Chinchilla, this allows us to accurately predict the final loss of a model from a simple equation. We show that this expression is accurate across a wide range of model hyperparameter values, enabling us to analytically make architectural decisions and train models more efficiently. Crucially, this analysis predicts that in contrast to existing literature, models should be wider rather than deeper, as the benefits of speed outweigh the benefits of depth.</description>

      <title>The Factuality Tax of Diversity-Intervened Text-to-Image Generation: Benchmark and Fact-Augmented Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompt-based "diversity interventions" are commonly adopted to improve the diversity of Text-to-Image (T2I) models depicting individuals with various racial or gender traits. However, will this strategy result in nonfactual demographic distribution, especially when generating real historical figures. In this work, we propose DemOgraphic FActualIty Representation (DoFaiR), a benchmark to systematically quantify the trade-off between using diversity interventions and preserving demographic factuality in T2I models. DoFaiR consists of 756 meticulously fact-checked test instances to reveal the factuality tax of various diversity prompts through an automated evidence-supported evaluation pipeline. Experiments on DoFaiR unveil that diversity-oriented instructions increase the number of different gender and racial groups in DALLE-3's generations at the cost of historically inaccurate demographic distributions. To resolve this issue, we propose Fact-Augmented Intervention (FAI), which instructs a Large Language Model (LLM) to reflect on verbalized or retrieved factual information about gender and racial compositions of generation subjects in history, and incorporate it into the generation context of T2I models. By orienting model generations using the reflected historical truths, FAI significantly improves the demographic factuality under diversity interventions while preserving diversity.</description>

      <title>GPT vs RETRO: Exploring the Intersection of Retrieval and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have become popular methods for adapting large language models while minimizing compute requirements. In this paper, we apply PEFT methods (P-tuning, Adapters, and LoRA) to a modified Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) and a baseline GPT model across several sizes, ranging from 823 million to 48 billion parameters. We show that RETRO models outperform GPT models in zero-shot settings due to their unique pre-training process but GPT models have higher performance potential with PEFT. Additionally, our study indicates that 8B parameter models strike an optimal balance between cost and performance and P-tuning lags behind other PEFT techniques. We further provide a comparative analysis between applying PEFT to an Instruction-tuned RETRO model and base RETRO model. This work presents the first comprehensive comparison of various PEFT methods integrated with RAG, applied to both GPT and RETRO models, highlighting their relative performance.</description>

      <title>ReCAP: Recursive Cross Attention Network for Pseudo-Label Generation in Robotic Surgical Skill Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In surgical skill assessment, the Objective Structured Assessments of Technical Skills (OSATS) and Global Rating Scale (GRS) are well-established tools for evaluating surgeons during training. These metrics, along with performance feedback, help surgeons improve and reach practice standards. Recent research on the open-source JIGSAWS dataset, which includes both GRS and OSATS labels, has focused on regressing GRS scores from kinematic data, video, or their combination. However, we argue that regressing GRS alone is limiting, as it aggregates OSATS scores and overlooks clinically meaningful variations during a surgical trial. To address this, we developed a recurrent transformer model that tracks a surgeon's performance throughout a session by mapping hidden states to six OSATS, derived from kinematic data, using a clinically motivated objective function. These OSATS scores are averaged to predict GRS, allowing us to compare our model's performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We report Spearman's Correlation Coefficients (SCC) demonstrating that our model outperforms SOTA using kinematic data (SCC 0.83-0.88), and matches performance with video-based models. Our model also surpasses SOTA in most tasks for average OSATS predictions (SCC 0.46-0.70) and specific OSATS (SCC 0.56-0.95). The generation of pseudo-labels at the segment level translates quantitative predictions into qualitative feedback, vital for automated surgical skill assessment pipelines. A senior surgeon validated our model's outputs, agreeing with 77% of the weakly-supervised predictions (p=0.006).</description>

      <title>Self-training Language Models for Arithmetic Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent language models achieve impressive results in tasks involving complex multistep reasoning, but scaling these capabilities further traditionally requires expensive collection of more annotated data. In this work, we explore the potential of improving models' reasoning capabilities without new data, merely using automated feedback to the validity of their predictions in arithmetic reasoning (self-training).
  In systematic experimentation across six different arithmetic reasoning datasets, we find that models can substantially improve in both single-round (offline) and online self-training, reaching a correct result in +13.9% and +25.9% more cases, respectively, underlining the importance of actuality of self-training feedback. We further find that in the single-round, offline self-training, traditional supervised training can deliver gains comparable to preference optimization, but in online self-training, preference optimization methods largely outperform supervised training thanks to their superior stability and robustness on unseen types of problems.</description>

      <title>MoESD: Mixture of Experts Stable Diffusion to Mitigate Gender Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to propagate social biases. For example, when prompted to generate images of people in certain professions, these models tend to systematically generate specific genders or ethnicities. In this paper, we show that this bias is already present in the text encoder of the model and introduce a Mixture-of-Experts approach by identifying text-encoded bias in the latent space and then creating a Bias-Identification Gate mechanism. More specifically, we propose MoESD (Mixture of Experts Stable Diffusion) with BiAs (Bias Adapters) to mitigate gender bias in text-to-image models. We also demonstrate that introducing an arbitrary special token to the prompt is essential during the mitigation process. With experiments focusing on gender bias, we show that our approach successfully mitigates gender bias while maintaining image quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11046v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation~(LoRA), which updates the dense neural network layers with pluggable low-rank matrices, is one of the best performed parameter efficient fine-tuning paradigms. Furthermore, it has significant advantages in cross-task generalization and privacy-preserving. Hence, LoRA has gained much attention recently, and the number of related literature demonstrates exponential growth. It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive overview of the current progress on LoRA. This survey categorizes and reviews the progress from the perspectives of (1) downstream adaptation improving variants that improve LoRA's performance on downstream tasks; (2) cross-task generalization methods that mix multiple LoRA plugins to achieve cross-task generalization; (3) efficiency-improving methods that boost the computation-efficiency of LoRA; (4) data privacy-preserving methods that use LoRA in federated learning; (5) application. Besides, this survey also discusses the future directions in this field. At last, we provide a Github page~\footnote{\href{https://github.com/ZJU-LLMs/Awesome-LoRAs.git}{https://github.com/ZJU-LLMs/Awesome-LoRAs.git}} for readers to check the updates and initiate discussions on this survey paper.</description>

      <title>BRIGHT: A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. Our dataset consists of 1,384 real-world queries spanning diverse domains, such as economics, psychology, mathematics, and coding. These queries are drawn from naturally occurring and carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard (Muennighoff et al., 2023), which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10, produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.3 on BRIGHT. We show that incorporating explicit reasoning about the query improves retrieval performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, incorporating retrieved documents from the top-performing retriever boosts question-answering performance by over 6.6 points. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings.</description>

      <title>Towards Aligning Language Models with Textual Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ALT (ALignment with Textual feedback), an approach that aligns language models with user preferences expressed in text. We argue that text offers greater expressiveness, enabling users to provide richer feedback than simple comparative preferences and this richer feedback can lead to more efficient and effective alignment. ALT aligns the model by conditioning its generation on the textual feedback. Our method relies solely on language modeling techniques and requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, though it still presents the main benefits of RL-based alignment algorithms and can effectively learn from textual feedback. We explore the efficacy and efficiency of textual feedback across different tasks such as toxicity reduction, summarization, and dialog response generation. We find that ALT outperforms PPO for the task of toxicity reduction while being able to match its performance on summarization with only 20% of the samples. We also explore how ALT can be used with feedback provided by an existing LLM where we explore an LLM providing constrained and unconstrained textual feedback. We also outline future directions to align models with natural language feedback.</description>

      <title>Effects of Scale on Language Model Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models exhibit scaling laws, whereby increasing model and dataset size yields predictable decreases in negative log likelihood, unlocking a dazzling array of capabilities. This phenomenon spurs many companies to train ever larger models in pursuit of ever improved performance. Yet, these models are vulnerable to adversarial inputs such as ``jailbreaks'' and prompt injections that induce models to perform undesired behaviors, posing a growing risk as models become more capable. Prior work indicates that computer vision models become more robust with model and data scaling, raising the question: does language model robustness also improve with scale?
  We study this question empirically in the classification setting, finding that without explicit defense training, larger models tend to be modestly more robust on most tasks, though the effect is not reliable. Even with the advantage conferred by scale, undefended models remain easy to attack in absolute terms, and we thus turn our attention to explicitly training models for adversarial robustness, which we show to be a much more compute-efficient defense than scaling model size alone. In this setting, we also observe that adversarially trained larger models generalize faster and better to modified attacks not seen during training when compared with smaller models. Finally, we analyze the offense/defense balance of increasing compute, finding parity in some settings and an advantage for offense in others, suggesting that adversarial training alone is not sufficient to solve robustness, even at greater model scales.</description>

      <title>Lessons from Learning to Spin "Pens"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-hand manipulation of pen-like objects is an important skill in our daily lives, as many tools such as hammers and screwdrivers are similarly shaped. However, current learning-based methods struggle with this task due to a lack of high-quality demonstrations and the significant gap between simulation and the real world. In this work, we push the boundaries of learning-based in-hand manipulation systems by demonstrating the capability to spin pen-like objects. We first use reinforcement learning to train an oracle policy with privileged information and generate a high-fidelity trajectory dataset in simulation. This serves two purposes: 1) pre-training a sensorimotor policy in simulation; 2) conducting open-loop trajectory replay in the real world. We then fine-tune the sensorimotor policy using these real-world trajectories to adapt it to the real world dynamics. With less than 50 trajectories, our policy learns to rotate more than ten pen-like objects with different physical properties for multiple revolutions. We present a comprehensive analysis of our design choices and share the lessons learned during development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this research, we revisit the architecture of semantic segmentation and evaluate the models excelling in polyp segmentation. We introduce an integrated framework that harnesses the advantages of different models to attain an optimal outcome. More specifically, we fuse the learned features from convolutional and transformer models for prediction, and we view this approach as an ensemble technique to enhance model performance. Our experiments on polyp segmentation reveal that the proposed architecture surpasses other top models, exhibiting improved learning capacity and resilience.

      <title>A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15955v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>DENEB: A Hallucination-Robust Automatic Evaluation Metric for Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of developing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning, with a particular focus on robustness against hallucinations. Existing metrics are often inadequate for handling hallucinations, primarily due to their limited ability to compare candidate captions with multifaceted reference captions. To address this shortcoming, we propose DENEB, a novel supervised automatic evaluation metric specifically robust against hallucinations. DENEB incorporates the Sim-Vec Transformer, a mechanism that processes multiple references simultaneously, thereby efficiently capturing the similarity between an image, a candidate caption, and reference captions. To train DENEB, we construct the diverse and balanced Nebula dataset comprising 32,978 images, paired with human judgments provided by 805 annotators. We demonstrated that DENEB achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing LLM-free metrics on the FOIL, Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and PASCAL-50S datasets, validating its effectiveness and robustness against hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Strongly-polynomial time and validation analysis of policy gradient methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel termination criterion, termed the advantage gap function, for finite state and action Markov decision processes (MDP) and reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating this advantage gap function into the design of step size rules and deriving a new linear rate of convergence that is independent of the stationary state distribution of the optimal policy, we demonstrate that policy gradient methods can solve MDPs in strongly-polynomial time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such strong convergence properties have been established for policy gradient methods. Moreover, in the stochastic setting, where only stochastic estimates of policy gradients are available, we show that the advantage gap function provides close approximations of the optimality gap for each individual state and exhibits a sublinear rate of convergence at every state. The advantage gap function can be easily estimated in the stochastic case, and when coupled with easily computable upper bounds on policy values, they provide a convenient way to validate the solutions generated by policy gradient methods. Therefore, our developments offer a principled and computable measure of optimality for RL, whereas current practice tends to rely on algorithm-to-algorithm or baselines comparisons with no certificate of optimality.</description>

      <title>Codev-Bench: How Do LLMs Understand Developer-Centric Code Completion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code completion, a key downstream task in code generation, is one of the most frequent and impactful methods for enhancing developer productivity in software development. As intelligent completion tools evolve, we need a robust evaluation benchmark that enables meaningful comparisons between products and guides future advancements. However, existing benchmarks focus more on coarse-grained tasks without industrial analysis resembling general code generation rather than the real-world scenarios developers encounter. Moreover, these benchmarks often rely on costly and time-consuming human annotation, and the standalone test cases fail to leverage minimal tests for maximum repository-level understanding and code coverage. To address these limitations, we first analyze business data from an industrial code completion tool and redefine the evaluation criteria to better align with the developer's intent and desired completion behavior throughout the coding process. Based on these insights, we introduce Codev-Agent, an agent-based system that automates repository crawling, constructs execution environments, extracts dynamic calling chains from existing unit tests, and generates new test samples to avoid data leakage, ensuring fair and effective comparisons. Using Codev-Agent, we present the Code-Development Benchmark (Codev-Bench), a fine-grained, real-world, repository-level, and developer-centric evaluation framework. Codev-Bench assesses whether a code completion tool can capture a developer's immediate intent and suggest appropriate code across diverse contexts, providing a more realistic benchmark for code completion in modern software development.</description>

      <title>Composing Global Optimizers to Reasoning Tasks via Algebraic Objects in Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables analytical construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGO (Composing Global Optimizers). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of monomial potentials, which are ring homomorphism, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global optimizers constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that over-parameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global optimizers such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.</description>

      <title>LongGenBench: Long-context Generation Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current long-context benchmarks primarily focus on retrieval-based tests, requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to locate specific information within extensive input contexts, such as the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) benchmark. Long-context generation refers to the ability of a language model to generate coherent and contextually accurate text that spans across lengthy passages or documents. While recent studies show strong performance on NIAH and other retrieval-based long-context benchmarks, there is a significant lack of benchmarks for evaluating long-context generation capabilities. To bridge this gap and offer a comprehensive assessment, we introduce a synthetic benchmark, LongGenBench, which allows for flexible configurations of customized generation context lengths. LongGenBench advances beyond traditional benchmarks by redesigning the format of questions and necessitating that LLMs respond with a single, cohesive long-context answer. Upon extensive evaluation using LongGenBench, we observe that: (1) both API accessed and open source models exhibit performance degradation in long-context generation scenarios, ranging from 1.2% to 47.1%; (2) different series of LLMs exhibit varying trends of performance degradation, with the Gemini-1.5-Flash model showing the least degradation among API accessed models, and the Qwen2 series exhibiting the least degradation in LongGenBench among open source models.</description>

      <title>ScienceAgentBench: Toward Rigorous Assessment of Language Agents for Data-Driven Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancements of language language models (LLMs) have piqued growing interest in developing LLM-based language agents to automate scientific discovery end-to-end, which has sparked both excitement and skepticism about their true capabilities. In this work, we call for rigorous assessment of agents on individual tasks in a scientific workflow before making bold claims on end-to-end automation. To ensure the scientific authenticity and real-world relevance of our benchmark, we extract 102 tasks from 44 peer-reviewed publications in four disciplines and engage nine subject matter experts to validate them. We unify the target output for every task to a self-contained Python program file and employ an array of evaluation metrics to examine the generated programs, execution results, and costs. Each task goes through multiple rounds of manual validation by annotators and subject matter experts to ensure its annotation quality and scientific plausibility. We also propose two effective strategies to mitigate data contamination concerns. Using our benchmark, we evaluate five open-weight and proprietary LLMs, each with three frameworks: direct prompting, OpenHands CodeAct, and self-debug. Given three attempts for each task, the best-performing agent can only solve 32.4% of the tasks independently and 34.3% with expert-provided knowledge. In addition, we evaluate OpenAI o1 with direct prompting and self-debug, which demonstrates the effectiveness of increasing inference-time compute. Still, our results underscore the limitations of current language agents in generating code for data-driven discovery, let alone end-to-end automation for scientific research.</description>

      <title>VHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current benchmarks for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) often focus on their perception or problem-solving capabilities and neglect other critical aspects such as fairness, multilinguality, or toxicity. Furthermore, they differ in their evaluation procedures and the scope of the evaluation, making it difficult to compare models. To address these issues, we extend the HELM framework to VLMs to present the Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models (VHELM). VHELM aggregates various datasets to cover one or more of the 9 aspects: visual perception, knowledge, reasoning, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety. In doing so, we produce a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of the capabilities of the VLMs across these important factors. In addition, we standardize the standard inference parameters, methods of prompting, and evaluation metrics to enable fair comparisons across models. Our framework is designed to be lightweight and automatic so that evaluation runs are cheap and fast. Our initial run evaluates 22 VLMs on 21 existing datasets to provide a holistic snapshot of the models. We uncover new key findings, such as the fact that efficiency-focused models (e.g., Claude 3 Haiku or Gemini 1.5 Flash) perform significantly worse than their full models (e.g., Claude 3 Opus or Gemini 1.5 Pro) on the bias benchmark but not when evaluated on the other aspects. For transparency, we release the raw model generations and complete results on our website (https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/vhelm/v2.0.1). VHELM is intended to be a living benchmark, and we hope to continue adding new datasets and models over time.</description>

      <title>System 2 thinking in OpenAI's o1-preview model: Near-perfect performance on a mathematics exam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The processes underlying human cognition are often divided into System 1, which involves fast, intuitive thinking, and System 2, which involves slow, deliberate reasoning. Previously, large language models were criticized for lacking the deeper, more analytical capabilities of System 2. In September 2024, OpenAI introduced the o1 model series, designed to handle System 2-like reasoning. While OpenAI's benchmarks are promising, independent validation is still needed. In this study, we tested the o1-preview model twice on the Dutch 'Mathematics B' final exam. It scored a near-perfect 76 and 74 out of 76 points. For context, only 24 out of 16,414 students in the Netherlands achieved a perfect score. By comparison, the GPT-4o model scored 66 and 62 out of 76, well above the Dutch students' average of 40.63 points. Neither model had access to the exam figures. Since there was a risk of model contami-nation (i.e., the knowledge cutoff for o1-preview and GPT-4o was after the exam was published online), we repeated the procedure with a new Mathematics B exam that was published after the cutoff date. The results again indicated that o1-preview performed strongly (97.8th percentile), which suggests that contamination was not a factor. We also show that there is some variability in the output of o1-preview, which means that sometimes there is 'luck' (the answer is correct) or 'bad luck' (the output has diverged into something that is incorrect). We demonstrate that the self-consistency approach, where repeated prompts are given and the most common answer is selected, is a useful strategy for identifying the correct answer. It is concluded that while OpenAI's new model series holds great potential, certain risks must be considered.</description>

      <title>ONCOPILOT: A Promptable CT Foundation Model For Solid Tumor Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carcinogenesis is a proteiform phenomenon, with tumors emerging in various locations and displaying complex, diverse shapes. At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks.
  To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights.
  This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</description>

      <title>MolMix: A Simple Yet Effective Baseline for Multimodal Molecular Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple transformer-based baseline for multimodal molecular representation learning, integrating three distinct modalities: SMILES strings, 2D graph representations, and 3D conformers of molecules. A key aspect of our approach is the aggregation of 3D conformers, allowing the model to account for the fact that molecules can adopt multiple conformations-an important factor for accurate molecular representation. The tokens for each modality are extracted using modality-specific encoders: a transformer for SMILES strings, a message-passing neural network for 2D graphs, and an equivariant neural network for 3D conformers. The flexibility and modularity of this framework enable easy adaptation and replacement of these encoders, making the model highly versatile for different molecular tasks. The extracted tokens are then combined into a unified multimodal sequence, which is processed by a downstream transformer for prediction tasks. To efficiently scale our model for large multimodal datasets, we utilize Flash Attention 2 and bfloat16 precision. Despite its simplicity, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness as a strong baseline for multimodal molecular representation learning.</description>

      <title>Boosting Deductive Reasoning with Step Signals In RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logical reasoning is a crucial task for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to tackle complex problems. Among reasoning tasks, multi-step reasoning poses a particular challenge. Grounded in the theory of formal logic, we have developed an automated method, Multi-step Deduction (MuseD), for deductive reasoning data. MuseD has allowed us to create training and testing datasets for multi-step reasoning. Our generation method enables control over the complexity of the generated instructions, facilitating training and evaluation of models across different difficulty levels. Through RLHF training, our training data has demonstrated significant improvements in logical capabilities for both in-domain of out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Additionally, we have conducted tests to assess the multi-step reasoning abilities of various models.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Domain Adaptation of Language Models using Modular Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain-specific adaptation is critical to maximizing the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on one or multiple targeted tasks, especially under resource-constrained use cases, such as edge devices. However, existing methods often struggle to balance domain-specific performance, retention of general knowledge, and efficiency for training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Modular Domain Experts (MoDE). MoDE is a mixture-of-experts architecture that augments a general PLMs with modular, domain-specialized experts. These experts are trained independently and composed together via a lightweight training process. In contrast to standard low-rank adaptation methods, each MoDE expert consists of several transformer layers which scale better with more training examples and larger parameter counts. Our evaluation demonstrates that MoDE achieves comparable target performances to full parameter fine-tuning while achieving 1.65% better retention performance. Moreover, MoDE's architecture enables flexible sharding configurations and improves training speeds by up to 38% over state-of-the-art distributed training configurations.</description>

      <title>PortLLM: Personalizing Evolving Large Language Models with Training-Free and Portable Model Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape the AI landscape, fine-tuning pretrained models has become more popular than in the pre-LLM era for achieving optimal performance in domain-specific tasks. However, pretrained LLMs such as ChatGPT are periodically evolved, i.e., model parameters are frequently updated), making it challenging for downstream users with limited resources to keep up with fine-tuning the newest LLMs for their domain application. Even though fine-tuning costs have nowadays been reduced thanks to the innovations of parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA, not all downstream users have adequate computing for frequent personalization. Moreover, access to fine-tuning datasets, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare, could be time-restrictive, making it crucial to retain the knowledge encoded in earlier fine-tuned rounds for future adaptation. In this paper, we present PortLLM, a training-free framework that (i) creates an initial lightweight model update patch to capture domain-specific knowledge, and (ii) allows a subsequent seamless plugging for the continual personalization of evolved LLM at minimal cost. Our extensive experiments cover seven representative datasets, from easier question-answering tasks {BoolQ, SST2} to harder reasoning tasks {WinoGrande, GSM8K}, and models including {Mistral-7B, Llama2, Llama3.1, and Gemma2}, validating the portability of our designed model patches and showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed framework. For instance, PortLLM achieves comparable performance to LoRA fine-tuning with reductions of up to 12.2x in GPU memory usage. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications to understand the portability of our model update patches, which offers new insights into the theoretical dimension of LLMs' personalization.</description>

      <title>RClicks: Realistic Click Simulation for Benchmarking Interactive Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Segment Anything (SAM) sparked research interest in the field of interactive segmentation, especially in the context of image editing tasks and speeding up data annotation. Unlike common semantic segmentation, interactive segmentation methods allow users to directly influence their output through prompts (e.g. clicks). However, click patterns in real-world interactive segmentation scenarios remain largely unexplored. Most methods rely on the assumption that users would click in the center of the largest erroneous area. Nevertheless, recent studies show that this is not always the case. Thus, methods may have poor performance in real-world deployment despite high metrics in a baseline benchmark. To accurately simulate real-user clicks, we conducted a large crowdsourcing study of click patterns in an interactive segmentation scenario and collected 475K real-user clicks. Drawing on ideas from saliency tasks, we develop a clickability model that enables sampling clicks, which closely resemble actual user inputs. Using our model and dataset, we propose RClicks benchmark for a comprehensive comparison of existing interactive segmentation methods on realistic clicks. Specifically, we evaluate not only the average quality of methods, but also the robustness w.r.t. click patterns. According to our benchmark, in real-world usage interactive segmentation models may perform worse than it has been reported in the baseline benchmark, and most of the methods are not robust. We believe that RClicks is a significant step towards creating interactive segmentation methods that provide the best user experience in real-world cases.</description>

      <title>SlideChat: A Large Vision-Language Assistant for Whole-Slide Pathology Image Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the progress made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology, they remain limited by a predominant focus on patch-level analysis, missing essential contextual information at the whole-slide level. The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB). We will fully release SlideChat, SlideInstruction and SlideBench as open-source resources to facilitate research and development in computational pathology.</description>

      <title>HumanEval-V: Evaluating Visual Understanding and Reasoning Abilities of Large Multimodal Models Through Coding Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coding tasks have been valuable for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), as they demand the comprehension of high-level instructions, complex reasoning, and the implementation of functional programs -- core capabilities for advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Despite the progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which extend LLMs with visual perception and understanding capabilities, there remains a notable lack of coding benchmarks that rigorously assess these models, particularly in tasks that emphasize visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce HumanEval-V, a novel and lightweight benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' visual understanding and reasoning capabilities through code generation. HumanEval-V includes 108 carefully crafted, entry-level Python coding tasks derived from platforms like CodeForces and Stack Overflow. Each task is adapted by modifying the context and algorithmic patterns of the original problems, with visual elements redrawn to ensure distinction from the source, preventing potential data leakage. LMMs are required to complete the code solution based on the provided visual context and a predefined Python function signature outlining the task requirements. Every task is equipped with meticulously handcrafted test cases to ensure a thorough and reliable evaluation of model-generated solutions. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LMMs using HumanEval-V, uncovering significant challenges. Proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve only 13% pass@1 and 36.4% pass@10, while open-weight models with 70B parameters score below 4% pass@1. Ablation studies further reveal the limitations of current LMMs in vision reasoning and coding capabilities. These results underscore key areas for future research to enhance LMMs' capabilities. We have open-sourced our code and benchmark at https://github.com/HumanEval-V/HumanEval-V-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Unearthing Skill-Level Insights for Understanding Trade-Offs of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With models getting stronger, evaluations have grown more complex, testing multiple skills in one benchmark and even in the same instance at once. However, skill-wise performance is obscured when inspecting aggregate accuracy, under-utilizing the rich signal modern benchmarks contain. We propose an automatic approach to recover the underlying skills relevant for any evaluation instance, by way of inspecting model-generated rationales. After validating the relevance of rationale-parsed skills and inferring skills for $46$k instances over $12$ benchmarks, we observe many skills to be common across benchmarks, resulting in the curation of hundreds of skill-slices (i.e. sets of instances testing a common skill). Inspecting accuracy over these slices yields novel insights on model trade-offs: e.g., compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on average, Gemini 1.5 Pro is $18\%$ more accurate in "computing molar mass", but $19\%$ less accurate in "applying constitutional law", despite the overall accuracies of the three models differing by a mere $0.4\%$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach by showing that insights derived from skill slice analysis can generalize to held-out instances: when routing each instance to the model strongest on the relevant skills, we see a $3\%$ accuracy improvement over our $12$ dataset corpus. Our skill-slices and framework open a new avenue in model evaluation, leveraging skill-specific analyses to unlock a more granular and actionable understanding of model capabilities.</description>

      <title>Influence Functions for Scalable Data Attribution in Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have led to significant advancements in generative modelling. Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such challenges in diffusion models by developing an \textit{influence functions} framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern distributed learning systems face a critical challenge when clients request the removal of their data influence from trained models, as this process can significantly destabilize system performance and affect remaining participants. We propose an innovative mechanism that views this challenge through the lens of game theory, establishing a leader-follower framework where a central coordinator provides strategic incentives to maintain system stability during data removal operations. Our approach quantifies the ripple effects of data removal through a comprehensive analytical model that captures both system-wide and participant-specific impacts. We establish mathematical foundations for measuring participant utility and system outcomes, revealing critical insights into how data diversity influences both individual decisions and overall system stability. The framework incorporates a computationally efficient solution method that addresses the inherent complexity of optimizing participant interactions and resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Mesa-Extrapolation: A Weave Position Encoding Method for Enhanced Extrapolation in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), although having revolutionized many fields, still suffer from the challenging extrapolation problem, where the inference ability of LLMs sharply declines beyond their max training lengths. In this work, we conduct a theoretical analysis to better understand why No Position Encoding (NoPE) fails outside its effective range, as well as examining the power of Position Encoding (PE) in this context. Our findings reveal that with meticulous weave position, PE can indeed be extended beyond effective range. Our theorems establish that LLMs equipped with weave PE can achieve improved extrapolation performance without additional cost. Furthermore, we introduce a novel weave PE method, Mesa-Extrapolation, which utilizes a chunk-based triangular attention matrix and applies Stair PE to manage the final chunk. This method not only retains competitive performance but also offers substantial benefits such as significantly reduced memory demand and faster inference speed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Mesa-Extrapolation, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution to enhancing LLMs applicative reach. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/soacker/Mesa-Extrapolation}.</description>

      <title>Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Using Applied Bayesian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study applies Bayesian models to predict hotel booking cancellations, a key challenge affecting resource allocation, revenue, and customer satisfaction in the hospitality industry. Using a Kaggle dataset with 36,285 observations and 17 features, Bayesian Logistic Regression and Beta-Binomial models were implemented. The logistic model, applied to 12 features and 5,000 randomly selected observations, outperformed the Beta-Binomial model in predictive accuracy. Key predictors included the number of adults, children, stay duration, lead time, car parking space, room type, and special requests. Model evaluation using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) confirmed strong alignment between observed and predicted outcomes, demonstrating the model's robustness. Special requests and parking availability were found to be the strongest predictors of cancellation. This Bayesian approach provides a valuable tool for improving booking management and operational efficiency in the hotel industry.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the ability of large language models to learn specific mathematical rules such as distributivity or simplifying equations. We present an empirical analysis of their ability to generalize these rules, as well as to reuse them in the context of word problems. For this purpose, we provide a rigorous methodology to build synthetic data incorporating such rules, and perform fine-tuning of large language models on such data. Our experiments show that our model can learn and generalize these rules to some extent, as well as suitably reuse them in the context of word problems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating AI-Generated Essays with GRE Analytical Writing Assessment</title>

Abstract: The recent revolutionary advance in generative AI enables the generation of realistic and coherent texts by large language models (LLMs). Despite many existing evaluation metrics on the quality of the generated texts, there is still a lack of rigorous assessment of how well LLMs perform in complex and demanding writing assessments. This study examines essays generated by ten leading LLMs for the analytical writing assessment of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). We assessed these essays using both human raters and the e-rater automated scoring engine as used in the GRE scoring pipeline. Notably, the top-performing Gemini and GPT-4o received an average score of 4.78 and 4.67, respectively, falling between "generally thoughtful, well-developed analysis of the issue and conveys meaning clearly" and "presents a competent analysis of the issue and conveys meaning with acceptable clarity" according to the GRE scoring guideline. We also evaluated the detection accuracy of these essays, with detectors trained on essays generated by the same and different LLMs.</description>

      <title>Advancing Interpretability in Text Classification through Prototype Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable performance in various text-based tasks but often lack interpretability, making them less suitable for applications where transparency is critical. To address this, we propose ProtoLens, a novel prototype-based model that provides fine-grained, sub-sentence level interpretability for text classification. ProtoLens uses a Prototype-aware Span Extraction module to identify relevant text spans associated with learned prototypes and a Prototype Alignment mechanism to ensure prototypes are semantically meaningful throughout training. By aligning the prototype embeddings with human-understandable examples, ProtoLens provides interpretable predictions while maintaining competitive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProtoLens outperforms both prototype-based and non-interpretable baselines on multiple text classification benchmarks. Code and data are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ProtoLens-CE0B/}.</description>

      <title>Bonsai: Gradient-free Graph Distillation for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph distillation has emerged as a promising avenue to enable scalable training of GNNs by compressing the training dataset while preserving essential graph characteristics. Our study uncovers significant shortcomings in current graph distillation techniques. First, the majority of the algorithms paradoxically require training on the full dataset to perform distillation. Second, due to their gradient-emulating approach, these methods require fresh distillation for any change in hyperparameters or GNN architecture, limiting their flexibility and reusability. Finally, they fail to achieve substantial size reduction due to synthesizing fully-connected, edge-weighted graphs. To address these challenges, we present Bonsai, a novel graph distillation method empowered by the observation that \textit{computation trees} form the fundamental processing units of message-passing GNNs. Bonsai distills datasets by encoding a careful selection of \textit{exemplar} trees that maximize the representation of all computation trees in the training set. This unique approach imparts Bonsai as the first linear-time, model-agnostic graph distillation algorithm for node classification that outperforms existing baselines across $6$ real-world datasets on accuracy, while being $22$ times faster on average. Bonsai is grounded in rigorous mathematical guarantees on the adopted approximation strategies making it robust to GNN architectures, datasets, and parameters.</description>
